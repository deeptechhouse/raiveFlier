Robert Hood
As one of the founding members of the legendary Detroit techno crew Underground Resistance – alongside “Mad” Mike Banks and Jeff Mills – Robert Hood’s legacy in the electronic music world is almost peerless. As well as pioneering the minimal techno sound with his 1994 LP Minimal Nation, he’s released on techno mainstays such as Metroplex and Jeff Mills’ Axis label, set up the Hardwax label and operates seminal techno label M-Plant – through which he’s released dozens of his own records, under his own name and as Floorplan. 2013’s Paradise LP as Floorplan was a volt-face in Hood’s musical story; the soulfulness of his minimal sound given new, hot-blooded life. It's this new life that keeps him a key figure in techno today.
In his 2014 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Hood passionately discussed his work with Underground Resistance, his Floorplan alias, the importance of hi-hats, and much more.
Hosted by Todd L. Burns Please help me in welcoming Robert Hood [applause] Robert Hood Hello. Todd L. Burns Obviously, if people think about the name Robert Hood I think the first music that comes to mind is techno, but I wanted to start where you actually maybe began with music, with hip-hop. You went under a different name for a while, not Robert Hood. What was your name and tell me a little bit about how you got into hip-hop? Robert Hood Yeah. Robert Noise was what I went by and that came from the Art of Noise and from the Bomb Squad, the production team for Public Enemy. Of course, Sugarhill Gang, but even before Sugarhill Gang, there was Dolemite. There was a guy called Blowfly when I was a kid. We used to sneak away and listen to these recordings of “adult” raps from this artist called Blowfly. That was my introduction into it. Again, with Sugarhill Gang and with Grandmaster Flash and Furious Five and Kurtis Blow... But then around the time when Run DMC came out that was when my world just shifted because of the way they arranged their music. There was no introduction. It was a departure from the way music was structured. They just came out with this blatant hard beat, and I just felt the earth shift and changed and there was this sparse, minimal production, and so hip-hop was my thing. Between that and stuff by Soft Cell, Thomas Dolby. I was just bored with the radio, Top 40 radio. The noise element, again going back to that, my thinking was why not throw the world a curveball and take kitchen utensils, for example, and use that for making your notes and your snares and your hi-hats as opposed to conventional instruments. Todd L. Burns Shall we listen to an early rap noise track? Robert Hood If I can bear it. [laughs] (music: Rob Noise – “Sins Against The Race” / applause] Robert Hood Wow. Thank you. Todd L. Burns How long has it been since you’ve heard that? Robert Hood Wow. That’s been maybe 25 years or so, and wow, that just takes me way back. I can remember recording that track. That’s the first time I met Jeff Mills and went straight off the street and I meet this guy called the Wizard. Jeff is small in stature and I’m looking for... I don’t know what I imagined. Todd L. Burns Because you’d heard him on the radio before though. Robert Hood Yeah, and I’m thinking he’s seven feet tall. I don’t know what I imagined. He’s just like the Wizard of Oz. You peek behind the curtain and there’s this... and I’m looking past him saying, “Where’s the Wizard?” And there’s this guy behind this four track editing tape, and I’m like, “OK. That can’t be him, so when is he going to come out?” I’m like, no disrespect to Jeff, but “OK, this nerdy guy here, okay, maybe he’s the Wizard.” So, it just threw me a curveball. Todd L. Burns I imagine when you saw him and how fast he was editing the tape that you were like, “Oh, actually this might be The Wizard.” Robert Hood Yeah, yeah. Watching Jeff edit tape is art. It’s like a performance. He does it so fast and so precisely. He’s like a surgeon. He’s so manic in the way he does things. It’s just... right now, flip the tape over, cut it, splice it, tape it, and it’s cut precisely. It’s just amazing. Todd L. Burns Obviously, he was on the radio. There’s Electrifying Mojo on the radio. We talked to Carl Craig yesterday on the couch and he talked quite a bit about Mojo. One of the radio shows that you always talked about though is one that was hosted by Derrick May. Robert Hood Yeah. The Electric Crazy People. Todd L. Burns What did that show sound like? Robert Hood Progressive, acid. It sounded crazy. It was just so forward thinking. I can remember recording the show and listening to it and just saying, “Wow, what is this” and just getting on the bus, going to school the next day and just... It just sounded otherworldly. I wasn’t sure exactly what to make of it. I had never heard a 303 before, and what is this they’re doing with rhythm and with sound and with this beat? What is this beat? I didn’t know what to call it. It wasn’t called techno at the time. It wasn’t called house, but I knew it as progressive music. We called it Transmat music. That’s all we knew. It’s Metroplex music. I don’t know. Todd L. Burns So, you’re listening to this. You don’t know how it’s made. Who taught you how it’s made? How did you find out about the stuff? Robert Hood I taught myself. I bought a Roland TR-505 from a pawnshop. I didn’t know how to program it, so I took it to a music store and they said, “Well, you have to get a manual and this is the basic way to program it.” Once I found out how it worked and how I could program it, I was done. I started trying to figure out... How can I make a hi-hat sing? How could I make a hi-hat sound like a reverb and what else can I do with this? That machine was my introduction into techno. Todd L. Burns You always mention the hi-hat and making it sing. Robert Hood Yes, yes. Todd L. Burns Why is the hi-hat for you so important? Robert Hood I don’t know. It’s just something about the ride cymbal and the atmosphere that a hi-hat creates. I would listen to jazz records and all funk and soul records and the hi-hat would always take you to another place. It seemed to take you to a higher atmosphere. That was what lifted... That was that extra small diminutive element that would lift you up out of where you were. Todd L. Burns I mean obviously you were doing electronic music stuff and hip-hop, and trying to fuse it together. Robert Hood Right. Todd L. Burns I mean that was the idea of Robert Noise, I suppose. Robert Hood Right. Todd L. Burns When you sent something to... Or what caught Mike Banks’s ear was the drum programming rather than the rapping. Robert Hood Right. Right. Because I didn’t want to rap. I wanted to find a rapper that could have the political lyrics of let’s say Chuck D combined with a more progressive attitude of Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest and combined also with the lyrics of Gang Starr, Guru. I couldn’t really find anybody so I decided to write it myself and perform it myself, but when I played the track to Mike, he noticed how I would make those hi-hats and snares just sort of swing and roll and the way I programmed the 505, and so that really made him pay attention. Todd L. Burns Shall we listen to Gang Starr for a minute. There’s a particular track you wanted to bring up. Robert Hood Yeah, yeah. This ... Todd L. Burns It’s called “Mass Appeal.” Robert Hood Yeah. Todd L. Burns While you’re looking for it, can you just maybe talk about why this one in particular from Gang Starr’s work? Robert Hood Yeah. “Mass Appeal.” I love Gang Starr. Gang Starr – DJ Premier, Guru – they embody what hip-hop is. The lyrics, the production, and not from a gangster rap point of view but from a storyteller’s point of view like a Langston Hughes type of jazz poetry combined with hip-hop. “Mass Appeal” for me is like my theme song, if you will. If I could rap over my music, this is what I would say. Rap to me is like battle music. It’s what I listen to before I go and DJ. It get me the mindset of going to conquer and slay a giant, and there’s nobody that can stand in my way. I am unstoppable. Also, this superstar DJ world we’re living in, I was sort of the anti-thesis to that. I didn’t want to be... I just wanted to add my two cents into the mix, into this techno game. There are those who began to look at me as, “Who is this dude? He’s not really one of us. He’s not really like us.” But I’m saying to myself, I can do this, too. As a matter of fact, I can conquer and slay giants and have an abundant career in this game, and I’m virtually unstoppable. Todd L. Burns That’s a pretty good introduction. Robert Hood All right. (music: Gang Starr – “Mass Appeal” / applause) Robert Hood Guru’s lyrics just told my story in how I felt about this whole game. There are those who are seeking so much relevance in techno and music and so much a sense of... just to have a sense of belonging and to make their mark in it that they’re selling their souls and stepping over people and looking down their noses at up-and-coming artists who are just trying to get in this game and express themselves, and so we lose ourselves when we’re just about trying to outrun the next guy, trying to outrace the next guy. Somewhere in the Bible it says that the race is not won by the swiftest or the strongest but the one who endures until the end. That’s what I’m about. Todd L. Burns Why do we take a look, I guess, before these superstar DJ days at a little portion of a video. I think it’s quite nice to see this naive kind of first moments starting out. This is from 1992. (video: Underground Resistance live) Todd L. Burns Maybe not the Underground Resistance part, but do those words still resonate for you? Robert Hood Yeah. Absolutely. Techno is a movement. It is a revolution. It’s a culture. This vehicle, this format of music that we’ve been blessed to be able to express ourselves through and create beautiful music and to beautify this world is just a blessing. It’s a privilege. Todd L. Burns Back then, I’m wondering what you were doing with those guys. Can you walk us through that video a little bit? Robert Hood Yeah, yeah. Todd L. Burns Please feel free to take a minute. Robert Hood It’s all right. I mean you caught me off guard with this whole thing. I’ve never seen myself performing with Mike and Jeff, and we were performing as more than a band. It was more than a revolution. It was more than a movement. I have so much love and admiration and respect for Jeff and Mike. This music helped to save my life and looking back at this young man this young Robert Hood, I was just unprepared for it. This music to me represents the struggle of black artists from Detroit who came from nothing. I came from Seven Mile living on the west side of Detroit and having nothing. Again, to be blessed, to be able to share this music with the world and to create and be everything that God has intended me to be creatively is humbling. I see this young 22, 23-year-old kid who’s trying to find his way and trying to say something that means something to the world. Todd L. Burns In terms of coming out of Detroit, because obviously Underground Resistance became a national and an international thing, you started touring a little bit and going to different places. One of the places that I think was instrumental in bringing you to a wider audience was New York. You guys went to New York to the CMJ Conference, wasn’t it? Robert Hood It was the New Music seminar. The first time I had been out of Detroit. Todd L. Burns Ever. Robert Hood Ever. This whole experience that year, it’s just life-changing. It was a very pivotal time in my life and just a life-changing event. Todd L. Burns We have a picture on the screen here. Can you talk about these people and what was happening when you were in New York together? [picture appears on screen] Robert Hood Yeah, yeah. Mike, he wanted his face blotted out of course. I mean ... Todd L. Burns Yeah. Of course. That’s Mike Banks. Robert Hood That’s Mike Banks. Right. Mike Clark, one of the first dudes I ever met in techno house music introduced me to the guy to the left of me, he was Agent X and introduced me to Underground Resistance. On the far left you have Franki Juncaj, one of the Members of the House. I know that guy in the middle. I can’t remember his... Todd L. Burns I’m pretty sure he had something to do with Crystal Waters, obviously. [inaudible comment from audience] Robert Hood Okay. There we go. Todd L. Burns It’s The Basement Boys. Robert Hood Okay. Todd L. Burns Thank you, Mr. Janson. Robert Hood We’ve met a gang of people. We’ve met a lot of people that ... I met Queen Latifah. She stopped us on the street and was asking us “What is all this UR business? I see folks run around with these UR shirts on. What is this? Is this a gang? Is this a movement? Are you guys terrorists? What’s going on?”
LL Cool J was... He stopped us on the street. We met Ice-T, guys from Digital Underground. We met Eazy-E. I shook hands with him. Todd L. Burns Your first time leaving Detroit, it must have been crazy having that experience meeting all these people. Robert Hood Yeah. The drive there was what I enjoyed. Todd L. Burns That’s a long drive. Robert Hood Yeah. It’s a long drive, but that’s what I enjoyed the most in the drive coming back because I felt changed. We were driving into Detroit and coming off the freeway listening to “The Whistle Song” by Frankie Knuckles on WJZZ. WJZZ played Larry Heard, Fingers Inc and all that stuff like it was nothing next to Earl Klugh and Ramsey Lewis and all that. It was just like... When I heard that, coming into Detroit is like a new day, a new sun is rising. I felt a fresh new energy like I was born again. Todd L. Burns You have a Band Aid on there. Robert Hood Yeah. Todd L. Burns What happened? Robert Hood I got shot. [laughs] Todd L. Burns You got shot right before you went to Detroit? Robert Hood I got shot before I went to the New Music Seminar working on a record store ... Todd L. Burns It really must have felt like a new day coming back. Robert Hood Yeah. That was ... Todd L. Burns You’ve survived this ... Robert Hood Exactly, exactly. Having escaped death... I can remember blood pouring out of my head and thinking, ‘This is it, I’m going to die. I haven’t really experienced life yet and here it is, I’m leaving earth.’ But to God be the Glory, I’m still here and again that whole experience traveling with Jeff and Mike and learning from them and meeting new people and traveling to New York and this whole experience of the New Music Seminar was just life-changing. Todd L. Burns A lot of people know the Underground Resistance story, so I wanted to jump ahead a little bit to when you guys grew apart and started your own things. Jeff started Axis, and you a little bit after that, I guess, started M-Plant. Robert Hood Right. Todd L. Burns Tell me about that moment of trying to find your way without these guys that you had done stuff with beforehand. Obviously, you stopped talking with them and stuff but ... Robert Hood Yeah. It’s like when Snoop Dogg left Death Row. It was just like, “Okay, there’s no more Dr. Dre. There’s no more Suge Knight and so what do I do?” I really had to really dig deep and look within myself and trust myself and believe. Trust me, I was lost. I didn’t know quite what to do here. I was ... Jeff had his career of course solidified. But my career, my position in techno music wasn’t quite as solid. Even though I came from this legendary group and there was a legacy, I still had to build my legacy. I remember feeling like Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest when A Tribe Called Quest broke up. Here you have Ali Shaheed Muhammad has a career. He went on did Lucy Pearl with Raphael Saadiq and Dan Robinson and Q-Tip was doing his thing... But my feeling was I didn’t want to be the runt of the group, and I could not be the one who just faded off in obscurity. I had to survive and I had to do more than survive. I have to thrive and show the world that I could stand on my own two feet. Todd L. Burns Was there a particular track or moment where you felt like, “Yes, now I have a sound that I can call my own?” I remember you said – Robert Hood Yeah, yeah, yeah. Todd L. Burns Go ahead, please. Robert Hood Yeah. When Jeff and I did the first release on Axis, H&M “Sleepchamber” was the track where I knew I had a voice and a sound that was completely all me. It had nothing to do with Underground Resistance. It had maybe some elements of Detroit’s essence in there, but this was my voice. I actually remember creating that track. Abdul Haqq, who used to do a lot of Transmat’s artwork, he was in my studio at the time. He’s working on something for me and I remember hitting a certain chord from the Juno 2 and saying, “Hey, this is it. This is so Detroit but I have never heard anything like it, but it’s all mine and it’s something new, it’s something fresh and original.” Todd L. Burns You obviously went on to do an album that I think a lot of people know. I think it’s worth listening to a track from it. This is from Minimal Nation and it’s called “One Touch.” (music: Robert Hood – “One Touch”) Todd L. Burns Sorry. Sorry about that. [applause] Robert Hood Thank you. Todd L. Burns Sorry about that. Minimalism, you’ve talked about it to many people for many years, but it actually wasn’t the idea of this. It wasn’t called minimalism or minimal at first. It was accessed authorized repetition? Robert Hood Access-authorized repetition. Jeff asked me to go in the studio and dig deep and to create something that was going to let the world know who I was and what I could do, so yeah, it was called AAR. The name was too long. It just didn’t fit. It wasn’t catchy enough and so Jeff and I were having this conversation about saying the minimal nation is rising. There’s this new movement called the minimal nation and that’s when we both said that’s it. We have to call this Minimal Nation. It’s funny that God when He created the earth, when the spirit of the lord moved over the waters and God said, “Let there be” and what we spoke and I what I spoke into existence, we didn’t even realized what brand new world we were creating and so yeah, listening to it, I couldn’t help just messing with the frequency and whatnot and in making the hi-hat do something else but just stand there. My whole idea with minimalism was to create rhythms inside of rhythms inside of rhythms, sort of hidden rhythms. I remember those posters back in the ‘80s where if you stared into it long enough you see a hidden picture. That was my idea was to not just create diminutive art or simple art. It was to draw, sort of like trance music. This is real trance music. I don’t know about that other stuff. This is the real deal. It was hypnotic and took you and drew you in and my thing was to not make everybody in the club go crazy with this spiritual movement but to have that one guy in the back of the room just lose it and just start to scream and almost catching the holy ghost. That was my whole focus. Todd L. Burns When you’re creating something like this where it is hypnotism, how do you know when you got it right? How do you know... After listening to it for so long, I assume it gets hard to hear it in a way especially with this type of music. Robert Hood Sometimes it’s instant. Sometimes the goose bumps or that spirit that let’s you know that’s it and sometimes it could take a few days, but you know when you have it is I could tell by the goose bumps. I could feel it by the hairs on the back of my neck raising up and, “Wow, this is it.” I know it’s real to me, so I know it’s going to be real to somebody else. Todd L. Burns Tell me a little bit about Floorplan. Obviously, minimal techno is what a lot of people know you for but especially, recently, this more housey alias has come around again. Robert Hood Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’m trying to remember Floorplan’s first release, “Funky Souls.” I had always had this yearning, burning desire to do some house music. But I didn’t want to sound like Frankie Knuckles. I didn’t want to sound like Lil Louis and Inner City. I wanted to do something else, and not necessarily the garage sound. So I wanted to blend minimalism and my Robert Hood sound with the Detroit house sentiments and emotions of let’s say Blake Baxter and Chip E. without being so repetitive, but just soulful house. Todd L. Burns I think obviously people know Detroit for techno but it also has an enormous house scene. Can you talk a little bit about that scene and when you were part of it. Robert Hood My best memories are of the Music Institute. If you were blessed enough to have been at this private club, it wasn’t open to the public, you had to know somebody who knew somebody to get in and check this thing out. Late hours, three or four in the morning. It’s a juice bar. Just a black box. Todd L. Burns What is a juice bar for those who do not know? Robert Hood Well, I guess just juice instead of alcohol. No alcohol and just forward-thinking, progressive people. It wasn’t about so much of the club-club atmosphere. It’s a strobe light and just blacked-out walls and you could hear DJs, Derrick May, Blake Baxter, D-Wynn, Kevin Saunderson, of course, and DJ Overdose was one of my favorites. It was like a spiritual mood in that room. You couldn’t really see the DJ. You could see a silhouette up in the loft playing this banging house music. I remember also going to Heaven to hear Ken Collier play. That was just the best house music you could ever want to hear, the best jack tracks, and the best acid house on the planet earth and it was just... I mean this club was... I mean again, late night five or six o’clock in the morning, this was unheard of. Todd L. Burns Ken Collier is someone who I don’t think is known terribly well outside of Detroit but... Robert Hood Sadly, not. Yeah. Todd L. Burns ...everyone you talk to mentions him and says he’s... Robert Hood The godfather. He was our godfather of Detroit house music. His mixing, his blends were just flawless, and he knew when to play what. If you studied him ... Jeff has also taught me this, too. You learn how to read the crowd and how to move the crowd when the crowd is tired, when to give them a break and when it’s time for them to go to the bar. Ken Collier was who I believe taught Derrick May, and they learned from this master, a true master. Todd L. Burns With the Floorplan material, you mentioned “Funky Souls,” which you put out quite a while ago and then you came back to Floorplan a couple of years ago in earnest. Why? What was happening around that moment that you felt like I need to revive this alias of mine? Robert Hood God woke me up in the middle of the night and when I say woke me up, literally out of a deep sleep and my eyes just sprang open and God said, “I want you to put the Gospel in the music. I want you to put this message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this music,” and I’m thinking to myself, “OK. I hear you. How are the people going to receive this?” I wasn’t sure. Maybe they won’t like this. They know me for the Minimal Nation stuff, the Internal Empire stuff, the Monobox stuff, maybe a little Floorplan but ... “How are the people going to receive this?” He said, “Don’t even worry about that. You’re going to start a new movement. You’re going to bring the church to the club.” I said, “Well, OK. Alright, OK.” Immediately I went to the studio and started listening to some music, and God directly told me to go here, listen to this Aretha Franklin record, this James Cleveland record, listen to Andraé Crouch. These are all records that I grew up on. I grew up in the black church. This is music my grandmother always listened to, and so it was a natural progression. It was just in my DNA. God told me, “I want Floorplan to be the vehicle or the catalyst to bring this music out.” Todd L. Burns Why don’t we listen to one of the tracks that I guess has come out in the past couple of years? (music: Floorplan – “Never Grow Old” / applause) Robert Hood Thank you. Todd L. Burns This is the first time aside from the previous Floorplan material that you’re really working very extensively with any vocal material, I think, if I’m not mistaken. Robert Hood Yeah. Todd L. Burns Was that a challenge for you? Robert Hood It really came together so natural and organic. I cried in the studio because of how God was orchestrating my every move. It was just so supernatural. I’ve done things in the natural, but now I was stepping over into the supernatural. I was amazed at how easy it was that this came together. Todd L. Burns Aretha Franklin is the singer on that, not to give too much away. [laughs] Robert Hood Yeah, yeah. That’s just fine. Yeah. Todd L. Burns You’ve talked quite a bit about her as an inspiration in the recording that was done. It was from I guess a church on the West Coast from the ‘70s, a live thing. Robert Hood Yeah, yeah. It was Aretha Franklin backed by the Reverend James Cleveland who was acting as the musical director and choir director and at the small church in LA I believe in ‘73. I had listened to this recording, of course, growing up as a kid in Detroit, and I thought it was amazing. One of my favorite tracks was “How We Got Over.” I remember how good that record made me feel as a young kid growing up and coming out of the Civil Rights Movement after Dr. Martin Luther King had been murdered and the riots in Detroit.
Aretha Franklin and James Cleveland and the Reverend C.L. Franklin was just a huge part of Detroit not just in the Detroit but amongst Christians living and trying to survive racism in Detroit. There’s a lot of racism in the automotive industry, coming from Alabama just trying to make a better life in Detroit, and this music was what... This is what lifted us up and gave us hope. So, listening to this record and making the beats for it, it was just like a marriage. It just came together so naturally like it was just meant to be. Todd L. Burns In the track that we listened to you can hear vinyl crackle or... Robert Hood The potato chips. Yeah. The crackling. I could have gone in iTunes or whatever and pulled out a clean version but... I questioned that and I said, “Shall I leave this in here?” I said, “Yeah. That adds to the whole vibe to take the listener back into the ‘70s. I found this record in a... I think it was a pawnshop somewhere and I said, “Yeah, this is the whole essence of the record.” This potato chips is the ... That’s it. It’s got to stay. Todd L. Burns You said in the past that techno and gospel aren’t that far apart. Why is that? Robert Hood No, because listen ... I remember times at the Music Institute where it was so spiritual and the music had gotten so sparse and so repetitious. It reminded me of early Sunday morning at church when the Holy Ghost was moving and you could see mothers just falling out in the aisles and banging on tambourines and it was just the drums and maybe the bass player or just the drummer by himself. You could feel the anointing sweep through the entire church. Again, mothers and church deacons just passing out in the aisles filled with the Holy Ghost, that’s what reminds me of techno. It’s not that far apart. I mean house music takes its roots from gospel music. You can go back to Ray Charles and Sister Rosetta Tharpe and the Clark Sisters and I know where ... but yeah, it’s all tied in together. House music is derived from gospel music, disco and all that. It’s tied in. Todd L. Burns You had your own moment in 2007, I think it was, in the church where you were the one falling in the aisles in the church, I think, so to speak. I read in an interview that your wife told you it’s time to speak. Robert Hood Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I don’t remember saying that, but it’s amazing that you got that. I remember that the spirit in the sanctuary was so high, and I was standing at the altar with my hands lifted up and she came behind me and put her hand on my back and told me to just open your mouth and speak, and I began to just shout, “Hallelujah, praise God,” to the top of my lungs and to speak in tongues and just things were coming out of my mouth that I didn’t realize could come out of my mouth. I didn’t know it was in me. I don’t think that it was then I was filled with the Holy Ghost, but I had a supernatural encounter, and so after that, later on, of course, I was baptized in the Holy Spirit and filled with the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues. That moment I knew I was... A prophecy which had been spoken over me... A man was at our church in Detroit and said that you’re going to preach. I was the sound man. I was at the mixer and when he pointed at me I was, “Who is he talking to?” I was the only one in that corner, and I’m looking around like, “He can’t be talking to me. He must be talking to somebody else.” Todd L. Burns Because you said you were quite shy back then. Robert Hood Yeah, yeah. I was always the one to leave church early. I would always sit in the back and never mind lift my hands or say hallelujah, praise the lord. I always want to get out of church early so I could go home and smoke. I wanted to get to my stash and start making music. [laughs] I mean I’m being real. When this minister said, “You’re going to preach,” I’m like saying, “What? Who is he talking to?” He must have this wrong. He got to be wrong.” Todd L. Burns I guess I want to touch on Monobox for a minute or two. This is something we haven’t talked about. How does it differ from Robert Hood and how does it differ from Floorplan? How would you describe it? Robert Hood I remember this book. I think I was 13. No, no 14, 15 years old. I read this book. I can’t remember the title of the book. It was about this black ominous box floating above the earth. It was an alien invasion, and for days and weeks this box floated above the earth. After a while, things started to happen. The animals began to disappear, organic life began to disappear and the box started to open up in different places. This big rectangular box and doors began to open and these other boxes began to come out of it. I don’t remember how the story ended or what happened but I remember that having such a strong impression on me like this mixer and things and sounds begin to come out of it. Monobox began as this other minimal life form, this alien life form that was coming out of Robert Hood. Todd L. Burns You mentioned minimal, and it obviously is minimal but I think it’s alien as opposed to maybe the Robert Hood stuff which has... Robert Hood Yeah. Absolutely alien. Yeah. That’s it. This alien life form that was coming out of this internal empire that was within Robert Hood. This was another dimension, another side of Robert Noise, Robert Hood, The Vision and these alien sounds began to come out. Todd L. Burns This is “Realm 02.” (music: Monobox – “Realm 02” / applause) Robert Hood Wow. Thank you. Todd L. Burns I find it quite interesting that when they’re playing, you can’t quite keep your hands off the mixer. Robert Hood I try and I can’t do it. [laughs] Yeah. A little undisciplined when it comes to that. Yeah. Todd L. Burns Do you have a lot of versions of tracks because I think at least to me it seems like you’re fiddling with it. It’s always, “Let’s make it sound different.” Or do you always have a track and then you’re like, “This is it. This is how it needs to sound.” Robert Hood Tracks like this, I’ve got about maybe seven or eight of them, seven or eight different versions and some with beats just some really sparse with the rhythm. Yeah, it was just trying to figure out which one is going to tell the story the best way to finish this book I was reading. Each track is representing a variation of how the story went, alternate ending and whatnot. But yeah, about seven or eight of these things and it’s just hard to figure out exactly where I wanted to go with this thing. Todd L. Burns Obviously, tons of artists talk about narrative in their songs and trying to tell a story. In techno, especially with a single track I think it’s a little bit harder. Is it hard for you or does it come pretty naturally? Robert Hood Sometimes it’s a struggle. Sometimes I find myself saying, “How do I tell the story of faith?” For example, with Omega, which obviously has no lyrics. Through the song titles and through the storyline, I try to give the listener an idea or a mental picture in your mind’s eye of if you just close your eyes to just what’s happening sort of the way that is Slick Rick tells a story where you can take the listener right into that world, sort of the way that Notorious B.I.G. who’s very, very good at taking you right there to what’s going on, sort of a cinematic reality in your mind so you can be right there immersed in the story. Todd L. Burns Both of those artists though of course have a lyrics to rely on. Robert Hood Right. Todd L. Burns So, I find it quite interesting that you’re able... Robert Hood The hi-hat. Todd L. Burns It’s the hi-hat? Robert Hood Yeah. Back to the hi-hats. The hi-hats, the bassline, the moodiness of the record, it takes you into this world of Detroit techno or into this world of Monobox, into the world of Floorplan and the hi-hat has always been my partner, my co-pilot to help raise that level of awareness or lower that level, to add and subtract and mathematically take you there and so for the most part, yeah, again it all came together organically and pretty easily. Sometimes there was a struggle. Todd L. Burns M-Plant is 20 years old this year. You’ve been around for even longer than that. Robert Hood Yes. Todd L. Burns How do you maintain longevity in the DJ world? I mean, it’s obviously a young person’s game. Robert Hood How can I say this without preaching? God is real in my life, and I can’t help talking about God without getting... It’s hard to talk about God’s vision and His purpose without getting passionate and all misty-eyed and whatnot because God has given me and each and every one of us the ability to defy gravity, to defy the laws of nature where it says, “OK, at 50 years old, 60 years old you’re supposed to stop.” For what? When I hold on to God’s unchanging hand and I became spiritually aware of who I am and what I can do, the Bible says in Philippians 4 and 13, “I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.” God is the source of my strength and every time I draw from the wellspring of God it gives me freshwater. The best way I can explain freshwater is, we all know what a pond is, it’s a body of water but it’s stale and there’s no new life in it. It becomes stagnant but a river flows with new water, constantly flowing with new water and so that being connected to God and staying connected to God gives me fresh water every day so I don’t have to run out of ideas and creativity. I’m always creative and I’ve got ideas and song titles and albums just on reserve. God is constantly feeding me and talking to me saying, “Hey, I want you to do this. I want you to tell the people this. I want you to tell the people that you’re going to a place where you never have to grow old. I want you to tell the people of the good news of the gospel that Jesus died for you and you don’t have to die, you can live forever. You can have everlasting life.” That’s what the album Paradise is about. It’s about everlasting life, of course. But again I’m staying young and fresh in this climate of new DJ’s. There’s new kids coming out every year, of course, but I’m still relevant and I never have to stop and slow down. Again, it goes back to being victorious, being unstoppable and creativity. You’re a writer, you’re a journalist and whoever you are as a cook, as a farmer, whatever you do, we’re created to build beautiful new things. God spoke and said, “Let there be light.” I could speak and say, “Let there be house.” Todd L. Burns Obviously, the techno world is... We talked about the roots and it’s obviously connected to that, but at the same time, I imagine the worry perhaps in your mind that there’s not a lot of religion on the dancefloor these days especially in nightclubs in Europe and hedonistic... It’s a hedonistic place. Robert Hood Yeah, yeah, yeah. Todd L. Burns Is there ever a worry in your mind about bringing this stuff up to an audience that may not care? Robert Hood No. No. Absolutely not. This is what God created me to do. Again, when the preacher said, “Hey, you’re going to preach,” he prophesized and he spoke it, so all I have to do is receive and say, “OK, God you want me to say something to this people that’s going to speak life into them.” I’m not going to speak about rims and gold teeth and hookers and smoke, I’m going to speak life into the people and so I’m going to tell them about this man called Jesus who’s real in my life and through this man called Jesus I have abundant life and we all have abundant life, but it’s about choice. My job is to say, “OK, here it is. I set the table. Now, you can either eat or starve.” There’s a saying that goes, “You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make them drink.” I would like for everybody in this room, everybody who’s going to see this and hear this to drink from the well of living water. Heaven 17 wrote this song called, “We’re Going to Live for a Very Long Time.” I didn’t realize that was actually a Christian record and so the lyrics are something like, “I don’t care what the world thinks. We’re going to a place where we’re never going to grow old and we’re going to live for a very long time.” Forever is a very long time. To live in heaven is beautiful. To live in hell, that’s miserable. I mean we have a choice. My job as a Christian, as a minister, as man of God is to not just serve you music but to serve you this spiritual food and say, “Here it is” and say, “You’re welcome to it. Come eat, come dine, come drink and you never have to be hungry. You’ll never have to be thirsty.” Todd L. Burns I wanted to touch on a couple more topics before we open up to questions. To go way, way back again, in addition to the music that you are making, you are also doing some illustrative work. Robert Hood Yes. Todd L. Burns I want to put a couple of things on the screen. Robert Hood OK. Todd L. Burns Can you talk about what that is? Robert Hood Yes. That’s the album cover for Members of the House. It’s a compilation for Vibe Records, Keep Believing. You have this man looking at hope, in my opinion. It’s an illustration I did. I think I was maybe 19, 20. [album artwork appears on the screen] The guys from the label, they were looking for the artwork and I said, “Hey, I might have something that might fit this concept and this title.” Todd L. Burns What were you using to illustrate back then? Is it just pen and paper? Robert Hood Graphite. Todd L. Burns Graphite. Robert Hood Yeah. Maybe a little bit charcoal but mostly graphite. Todd L. Burns You also did work with other Detroit techno people. Robert Hood Yeah. Juan Atkins. I can remember meeting Juan at... Where were we? Maybe the UN, maybe the Majestic Theater, I can’t remember. He asked me to come over and show him some of my work and we started a relationship through this meeting, and so that’s hard to look at. That’s not... This was more of a graffiti style and so ... Todd L. Burns Why is it hard to look at? [album artwork appears on screen] Robert Hood It’s so basic. When I look at that other piece, I took my time and really... But this is good for what it was for. That’s what it was for. Hype Stuff this compilation that Jeff and Mike were working on at the time and they needed some art work and so I came out with this style, this illustration. My father was an illustrator. He was a jazz musician, so it’s in my DNA. Todd L. Burns You mentioned Abdul earlier. Robert Hood Abdul Haqq. Todd L. Burns Who is he and can you talk a little bit about the stuff that he has done with his illustration work? Robert Hood Mostly Transmat album covers for Derrick May and he did some work for me for... I had a newsletter around say ‘92, ‘93 called Global Techno Power. It’s a weekly or... I’m sorry, monthly newsletter and he did graphics for me, and I did a compilation. It’s a series of compilations for Alpha Records from Japan. He did all the artwork. I remember his material, his work being surreal, very spacy and almost like poetry. It was visually equivalent to what Derrick May was creating, and so yeah, I thought this was... He was amazing. Todd L. Burns Tell me about this newsletter. Robert Hood Yeah. Todd L. Burns I’ve never heard about it before. If I were to open this up, what would I see in it? Robert Hood You’d see charts, the Top 10 list maybe, some reviews and some articles on maybe electronic equipment. Todd L. Burns You were doing all of the writing? Robert Hood Yeah. For the most part, I did everything. There was a guy, Karl Martinson, who was doing the art work. Him and I worked together. It was just basically him and myself. Todd L. Burns This was what time period are we talking? Robert Hood ‘92, ‘93. Todd L. Burns You were in Underground Resistance at that point and doing ... Robert Hood Yeah. They decided Detroit needs a newsletter. [Unintelligible], some might know him as DJ 3000. Fast Forward was the newsletter he did. I think he decided not to do it anymore so we decided that Detroit needed some kind of publication to help promote not only Underground Resistance and its artist but Detroit techno. Todd L. Burns Why was that? I mean what was the motivation behind spreading that gospel so to speak? Robert Hood I don’t know. It’s just extra propaganda to ... Every movement I guess needs a propaganda letter so that was it. Todd L. Burns Did it feel like a movement at that time? Robert Hood It did. With UR, The Punisher, X-101, X-102 it was a movement. It was like a cult. It was like ISIS at the time and we were sonically terrorizing the world, the music industry. Not that I’m promoting ISIS or nothing like that. We were kind of like the Public Enemy of techno and we were like X Clan in that whole S1W movement and so yeah, it felt like it. All of Detroit city was standing up and taking notice. Again, when we went to New York for the New Music Seminar, we’re being stopped by LL Cool J, Ice-T and everybody wants to know what is this. We were just flooding the streets with this terrorist attitude. Todd L. Burns Why don’t we go ahead and open up to questions actually? Robert Hood OK. Todd L. Burns Just a quick note, the questions should only be asked by participants. I apologize but it’s obviously for them so please if you have a question for Robert, save them until later. Does anyone have any questions? Robert Hood Alright. Audience Member Hey. Robert Hood Hey. Audience Member I’m a DJ, too. I’m really thankful for [and am] a really fan of what you do. Robert Hood Thank you. Audience Member I really like how you develop time because it seems like ... I really like when I hear music that is not rushing anything and maybe I was wondering if you could talk a bit about that. How do you develop time in what you do? Robert Hood Yeah. The pace. I decided to just gradually pace myself. Why rush to it? You’re not in a race. Gradually evolve and build and not try to outrun the other artist. Let them be them and let them be you. What God has for you is for you. What God has for me if for me, and so trying to... Again, I would compare myself sometimes to Jeff Mills. It’s hard to be in that camp and look at what he’s doing and say, “Wow. How do I keep up with that? He’s so sporadic.” He’s here one place and here the next minute, but I’m not Jeff Mills, I’m Robert Hood. It’s hard to compare myself to let’s say Kevin Saunderson or DJ Pierre or Marshall Jefferson. I have to be me, and so I go at my own pace and in keeping up with the times, I have my own universe. I have my own time system and it doesn’t operate by somebody else’s sense of time, if that makes sense to you. I had to realize who I was and what I had and the legacy that I was trying to build. I can’t base it off of somebody else’s legacy. Todd L. Burns How do you do that when you have festival set and very limited amount of time? Because I think you’re quite unique still in those situations where it doesn’t feel like you’re rushing so to speak. Robert Hood Yeah. Just supernaturally, God can suspend time. He can turn back the clock if he willed it and so being connected to God, I don’t have to comply and conform to this hour set. I can just simply speak and say, “God, inside of this hour and a half, give me more time” and it will actually seem like I have bent time and spaced it out where there’s plenty of time, if that makes sense.
Spiritually, the spirit realm is like The Matrix. It’s like we live in this matrix and then you have a red pill, you got a blue pill. I choose to live, step out of the matrix, out of this natural realm and step into reality, this spirit realm and bend time and say I have more than enough time whether it’s 45 minutes or two hours or whatever. It’s enough for me to do whatever. Audience Member Hi. Robert Hood Hi. Audience Member Thank you for taking time out and I really appreciate it. Robert Hood God bless you. Audience Member You mentioned light and the hand of God helping you along the way. I was just wondering that is the light your only source of inspiration because light cannot exist without darkness and do you ignore darkness or do you consider it as part of your process at all? Robert Hood Absolutely part of the process. Light illuminates darkness. If this room was dark and you light a candle, it’s going to illuminate this room. So darkness is absolutely necessary in order to show light. You don’t light a candle in the sunlight. It is, yes, all a part of... Again, going back to Genesis and there is darkness upon the face of the earth and the spirit of God moved across the waters and God said, “Let there be light to illuminate.” He turned on the lightbulb and lit up the world and created mankind and breathed life into each and every one of us, and so that’s what we are to do as little g’s not big G’s of God, children of God and to spread light throughout this entire world. So, yes, absolutely a part of the process. Audience Member Thank you. Robert Hood Yes. Yes, sir. Audience Member Hi. Robert Hood Hi. Audience Member I’m very honored to have you and to be able to speak to us. It’s great. We learned a lot, I guess. I’m a producer. I produce tribal house and the reason I like tribal house is because of spirituality. I want to ask how do you go about producing the spirituality on your production? How do you go about arranging it and how do you know you’ve reached that point where if someone else listened to it it’s ... Like, if I listened to it, I’m definitely going to feel the spiritual point of view. Robert Hood The first thing I do when I go into the studio is I pray and ask God to tell me what to say. “What it is that you would have me to do?” The soul houses the mind, the will and our emotions, and so I don’t want to base... When I go into the studio, I don’t want to approach it from this standpoint of my feelings so much, but moreso what God would have me to say and to anoint my hands and my mind to create something that’s going to touch people. Drums. You can go back to Africa. The African drum is communication. It’s a communication tool. It’s the telephone, and so through the drum programming I began to build a foundation and God will tell me to guide and anoint my hands to mold and shape this formless clay, so to speak, and to build up the drums and to begin to add layers of sound here and there, but first starting with the drums as the solid foundation and then building with these other materials to build this form of communication to tell the story. You know it when you feel the spirit of God moving through you. You can feel the Holy Spirit. There are other spirits in this realm, in this world, evil spirits, that’s what we want to stay away from, of course, but you can feel it, again, the goose bumps, the hair on your neck raising and saying, “Wow, this is powerful and I know this is going to effect change in this world.” Todd L. Burns Talking about the nuts and bolts for a moment. You’ve used the same setup for a very long time, if I’m not mistaken. Can you talk a little bit about what you use and how your workflow very concretely goes? You talked about drums being the base. Robert Hood Yeah, yeah. I’m old enough to remember – I don’t know if some of you remember – the SP-1200, the Akai instruments, the MPC instruments was the weapon of choice for a lot of producers. It wasn’t for me. The 303 was very prominent and still is. The 909... I had this little pocket sequencer. It’s a Yamaha QY100 or I think it was ... Do you mind pulling that up? Todd L. Burns Yeah. I think it’s a 1000 or 7000. It’s part of a series. Robert Hood Now, I’m using the 7000 or the 1000. I can’t remember, but back then around ‘90, ‘91, ‘92, I was using the small pocket version. That was my weapon of choice. That’s what I programmed all of my thoughts and movements with. For me, it wasn’t about – the one in the middle is the one I’m using [points to host's computer scree]. For me it was about just like when I have the Roland TR-505. It was about squeezing the lifeblood out of that one machine, to get it to talk and communicate. I’ve seen plenty of producers have basements full of equipment and still not being able to make a record. My thing was about being able to slay a giant with the tools that I was familiar with, and for me it was like like David and Goliath, choosing five smooth stones to kill the giant. That’s all I need. The rest of this equipment was to me cumbersome, and it got in the way. It was about subtracting. It’s about doing math and subtracting and saying, “OK, this is all I need to walk on water and to kill giants.” Todd L. Burns It’s up on the screen now. Robert Hood Yeah. Todd L. Burns This is what you’re using today. Robert Hood That’s what I use today. That and I use an Akai XR20 drum machine, a microKORG and maybe an MPC 5000 which is a monster in itself. Those are pretty much my weapons of choice. Not a lot. Todd L. Burns A minimal setup, if you will. Robert Hood A minimal setup. Todd L. Burns Are there any other questions? Over there. Audience Member Good morning. Thank you. Robert Hood Good morning. Audience Member I’m probably the guy going nuts in the back of the club listening to... Robert Hood My man. Audience Member Speaking of minimalism, is there something in music or outside music, some piece of art you see as the perfect sample of minimalism and you see as some kind of a horizon you want to reach when you make your minimal tracks? Robert Hood You know what? Beginning with Detroit, the Fist, Joe Louis’s Fist in Detroit. That says so much. When that sculpture was first unveiled, I thought, “What a joke? Why couldn’t they build a whole statue? Was the budget so low that all we could afford was a fist?” Then I began to look at that fist as a symbol of Detroit’s resilience and Detroit’s power, Detroit’s progressive attitude. It also makes me think of the Detroit Bad Boys, the Detroit Pistons and it’s sort of a bad boy aggressive nature. Joe Louis’s fist. It speaks of, to me, progression that each and every... Everybody that lives in Detroit, we’re survivors. One thing about Detroit is we’re resilient, we’re resourceful, and we know how to survive whatever comes our way. That to me is that one fist. I’m glad that they didn’t put the entire statue. Maybe that’s all we could afford. [laughs] Maybe the city was broke, but this is it. Audience Member Thank you. Todd L. Burns I was quite interested that there are so many other styles of music that you hear minimalism in. Obviously, you mentioned Run DMC earlier. Can you talk about some other tracks that aren’t techno that really embody that sort of vibe and style for you that maybe people don’t hear it in exactly that same way? Robert Hood It wasn’t so much as other forms of music. Soft Cell, “Tainted Love,” we talked about that yesterday, and I was captivated by its strip-down nakedness and how it grabbed people’s attention and records like, “Just Can’t Get Enough” by Depeche Mode, the part where it’s just the bassline and the drum, that repetition, was to me one of my first or earliest examples of what minimal was. It was about taking that one part that break and repeating it over and over in order to create this hypnotic spell and to captivate the listener and take you into... Forget about the rest of the record. I want to take you into this other world. We want to take this one part, repeat over and over, and take you somewhere else away from Depeche Mode or away from this club into a whole nother universe and another galaxy.
Records like that, records like “Dancer” by Gino Soccio, I can remember being 13, 14 years old going to basement parties. I’m too young to go to the discotheque to hear Chic and so it was about going to the basement party and to see the way that the breakdown had an effect on the dancers and what they would do and how they would react and then next just sort of reacting to this record in a whole other way. That’s what minimal was about to me. Artist like Gino Soccio, Kano, Soft Cell. Depeche Mode, that to me was diminutive art. Todd L. Burns One thing you mentioned that I found really surprising to listen to in this kind of new context was the Temptations. Robert Hood Yes. Yes, yes, yes. “Papa Was A Rolling Stone,” and the bassline and the strings and when the hi-hat begins to kick in – Todd L. Burns It’s always about the hi-hat. Robert Hood It was – again, sorry. The hi-hat raised that, “OK. There’s another building element it takes you somewhere else.” Todd L. Burns Let’s listen to this with that kind of context? Robert Hood Yes. Yes. (music: The Temptations – “Papa Was a Rolling Stone” / applause) Todd L. Burns Are there any other questions? Audience Member Hi. Robert Hood Hello. Audience Member Okay. I’m not sure how I’m going to ask this question. When I am listening to you, you talked about your music and it really ... Someone who’s done some West African dance that reminds me of spirituality in the drumming that I think as African-Americans we lost in some generation, so it’s really awesome and refreshing to see an approach in drumming like that. But I guess I was just wondering if you ever looked to any West African music or African music in general for inspiration and if it’s ever informed your music or anything like that. Robert Hood I absolutely have. Yeah, yeah. Just to listen to and to get caught up in the storytelling elements of African drumming and not to try to emulate or copy it but for inspiration, to draw from that spirit and try to create that same spirit through my electronic drum programming, if that makes any sense. Yeah. Again, the drums are a communication tool. So you heard these hi-hats and this rhythm building and then falling, adding and subtracting in the repetition of it evoking a spiritual rhythm.
You could see it in the dancing of African dancers and watching them and seeing it spiritually take them into another realm. That’s what it’s all about, so yeah, I absolutely listen to aborigine drumming, West African drumming, Cuban drumming and rhythm to try to add to my formula. Thank you for that. Audience Member Awesome. I also noticed that even the sample, the vocal sample, it almost felt like a call and response that you might find in... Anyway, that was just awesome. Robert Hood Yeah. That’s true. The call and response. Just watching the way a dancer reacts and responds to this rhythm whether it be African or whether it be a dude from Detroit in that basement party. It’s the same reaction. Todd L. Burns Does anyone else have any questions? Robert Hood Yes, sir. Hello. Audience Member Hello. Robert Hood Hello. Audience Member I guess you have lots of offer for gigs. I’d like to know how do you choose your gig? Do you let your agent choose your gigs or is it... What kind of motivation do you have when you take an offer for a gig abroad? Robert Hood It’s the one that’s paying the most money, but no. [laughs] [applause] I’m kidding. I mean my agent, I mean he floods me with gigs. You have to take this gig here in LA, New York, and they just ... It’s really not a method to it. When I was about 16, 17 years old, a friend of mine said, “Robert, you’re the type of dude you’ll play records for kids at a daycare.” So, for me it’s about being able to put on some records for some people and let’s sit around and listen to some music. That’s what it’s all about for me. If my agent says, “Hey, you’re playing in Paris, you’re playing in Tel Aviv,” that’s where we’re going. I let God choose for me. Audience Member OK. Thank you. Robert Hood You’re welcome. Todd L. Burns I suppose for the participants it might be interesting to get an insight as to how you’ve gotten a relationship with your agent to the point where you trust them completely to get you to these places. Robert Hood I don’t trust anybody. [laughs] I don’t trust anybody but God. No. I’m just kidding. My agent, Oliver Way it’s been developed from a working relationship to a friendship relationship over the years, and it’s just a matter of saying, “Hey, dude, you know what we like and what we don’t like.” Todd L. Burns What do you like? What do you not like? Robert Hood We like nice hotels. We like just to be treated with respect and dignity and not to be shuffled here and there in a hurry. I’m not a diva with that kind of attitude where I have to have caviar in my dressing room and to have water at a certain temperature, and I need the core to be just like my living room at home, nothing like that. But just to respect me as a person. If I were a booking agent, I would do the same thing for anybody and say, “Hey, this is my guy. He needs adequate transportation and just the basic necessities that you would... and just honor him and revere him and respect him.” That’s it. Todd L. Burns We had Seth Troxler on the couch last year and he’s obviously also a touring DJ and he said the one thing that he wants more than anything is a clean pair of socks. Robert Hood Oh, my God. I mean he’s preaching. That’s gospel right there. Let me tell you. Clean socks and clean underwear is like gold. You know because ... I mean socks is... Todd L. Burns I feel like I touched a nerve here. [laughs] Robert Hood I just bought a pair of brand new socks yesterday and I’m like, “Socks!” It’s five to a pack. We usually get three to a pack in the States, unless you buy a big multi-pack. Todd L. Burns Everything is better in Japan. Robert Hood I don’t believe we’re talking about socks. My man is right here in his socks and they’re clean. There’s nothing like clean fresh socks. I mean it’s a sense of peace and well-being and it makes you think “OK, I can go a little bit further. I can travel to this next city because I got a fresh pair of socks. [applause] Todd L. Burns I’m glad I asked that question. Are there any other questions ... Robert Hood Socks. Todd L. Burns ... from any of the participants? Cool. Robert will be around. He’ll even be here tomorrow for the Tom Tom Club lecture, which you were talking about earlier today or yesterday. Robert Hood Yes. My daughter, she loves Tom Tom Club. We will be here and ... yeah. Todd L. Burns If you do have any questions please feel free but for now please... Thank you. Thank you, Robert Hood. Robert Hood God bless you. [applause]

Terri Hooley
It’s September 12th 1978, and John Peel has just played the same song twice, for the first time ever on BBC radio. That song was the Undertones’ “Teenage Kicks” – a scorching punk rock love song that went onto become an touchstone of youth, rebellion and hope for generations to come. The man who gave Peel this record was Belfast DJ, and founder of the Good Vibrations record store and label, Terri Hooley.
As part of the RBMA Weekender in Belfast, September 2014, Hooley talked about his musical history, the role that punk rock played in Northern Irish youth culture, and the trials and tribulations that have made him a local legend.
Transcript: Lauren Martin Hello… hi, everybody. Welcome to Red Bull Music Academy weekender in Belfast. It’s really great to kick off the electricity with the fantastic Terri Hooley. Terri Hooley, everybody. Terri Hooley Thank you, Lauren, for the lovely introduction. I usually introduce myself as the biggest wanker you’ve ever met. I’m surprised anybody turned up. I’m glad. I was a bit worried about that. The other thing I was a bit worried about was when they said “lecture.” I don’t like to be lectured at, and I don’t like to lecture to anybody, so I’m quite glad it’s a question-and-answer thing. The other thing is, anybody wants to ask me anything, feel free. I’ll try and tell you the truth and not run off on a million tangents; tell you a story, start my story, and it’ll last three years. Lauren Martin This can’t last three years, this is an hour and a half, but we’ll do our best to cover as much as possible. I thought, seeing as we’re in Belfast and we’re speaking to you, your own story and the story of Belfast run in almost a perfect tandem. I thought I’d kick off with a track that kind of is the very beginning for you. (music: Hank Williams – “I Saw the Light”) Terri Hooley No better tune. Lauren Martin Can you give us a little bit of a background about that particular track, and its story for your life, because it’s tied into quite a pivotal moment in your young life. Terri Hooley It’s very funny. I used it at the opening of Good Vibrations, the film. I’m a huge Hank Williams fan, and a lot of young people are coming up and asking me to play it, which is great. Hank Williams was a great singer-songwriter, and most of his work was done in three years, and he died early. He left a legacy, just everybody… loads of people have recorded, and are still recording Hank Williams songs. It’s my first musical memory, because at the age of six, I lived in East Belfast in a place called Garnerville estate, in a pre-fab bungalow, and I got my eye shot out. When the ambulance came, and they put bandages around my two eyes, and it was a lovely sunny day and I could see the light, and they were putting me into the ambulance, and I was thinking, “These guys are crazy. I could walk in the ambulance myself.” All I could think of was Hank Williams’s “I Saw the Light”. So, the BBC, many, many years later, phoned me up and went, “Is it true, the grandfather of punk is a big Hank Williams fan?” I said, “I absolutely am.” They said, “Would you like to come in and talk – it’s his birthday tomorrow?” I went, “I’d love to.” I told that story, and a woman got in touch with the BBC and wanted to know how to get in touch with me, because they didn’t know where I’d first heard it. It turned out that her aunties ran a guest house on Botanic Avenue, and my grandfather used to go around and collect on a Friday, money – donations for the church, because we were running a guest house we didn’t go then. I think even Gene Vincent once stayed in that guest house, but I’m not quite sure about that. Anyway, one Friday I went around and they put on that record, and I begged them and begged them and begged them to play it again and again and again. I found out eventually where I first heard it. Stuart Bailey’s sitting there – just back from Nashville – gave me his father’s 78 copy for a Christmas present there. It’s one of the few things I’m allowed to put up on the wall in my girlfriend’s house. After eight years, I was allowed to put up two awards, and Stuart’s 78… I’ve got a foot in the door now. Lauren Martin You finally got a copy of it to hang and put on your wall. Terri Hooley It’s just beautiful to see it, and it’s in really good condition. It just reminds me of… I used to go to people’s houses, especially in the ’60s. I love all kinds of music. I’m very passionate about music. I’m not a musical snob – far from it. Everybody thinks I’m… I love some of the most ridiculous records in the world. I used to go, and all these girls… It was the ’60s, and it was the Stones, it was the Beatles, it was a really exciting time. I’d be pulling out their dads’ Charlie Parker albums, or Paganini, and Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerald. “Why you playing my mom and dad’s record collection?” It’s just, I was always really interested to read the covers, to see who recorded it – fanatical, really. I was a bit of a record collector’s nerd at the time. I’m not so much now, but I was definitely then. Lauren Martin You were quite the record collector nerd from early on. Did you get that from your father? Terri Hooley No. The greatest thing about… We lived… We were more or less very, very poor, and everybody was in those days. The first record I ever actually owned, the day I became a record collector, I have still got; unbelievable – three divorces, been burnt out – and it was a Summer County [margarine] free flip-flop record. The guy came down the street, and he put one through our letter box, and I ran after him and asked… I begged him for one, and he gave it to me. I knew my brother, even though he didn’t really want it, he wouldn’t let me have the other record. He was a bit mean, actually. I don’t want to talk ill of the dead, but he was a right bastard. I hid it in the airing cupboard, under the towels. For months, I just would go in and lock myself in the bathroom and read all the words. I invented a game… It was Terri Hooley, Stuart Bailey, and I’d count all the “Ts” on the record, and you got a point for each “T”, and the “S” for Stuart, and then see who would win. I’d do this with all my friends. One day, a friend asked me, would I give him a hand with a chair to go around to his auntie’s house, and she had a record player. I heard it for the first time. It was, “Swinging on a Garden Gate,” by Humphrey Lyttelton, who was a great jazz musician, because jazz was the music of my youth. When I heard it for the first time I thought, “Jesus, this is just wonderful,” and that was my very first record that I ever got, and I didn’t even have to steal it. David Holmes, famous DJ, he wrote in my book… The original text was, “Terri gave me all these ’60s soul records, and I think he stole them from somebody who was in prison.” “David, what are you going on about? I might steal your girlfriend, I might steal your drink, I might steal your drugs, but I’d never steal your record collection; no way.” Lauren Martin Even from early on, music was such a massive part of your life, but I know that as well as records, radio was a big part of your life. Terri Hooley Yeah. Lauren Martin I know that your dad bought you your first radio when you were six years old; he brought it back from a trip? Terri Hooley No, my dad was very left, and my mom was very Christian. My father was English, and they met during the war, and my grandfather didn’t like my dad much at all, neither did my uncles. My grandfather pleaded with my mom, the day that they got married, not to marry him. He was a real leftie, and they were all Orange. My mom married my dad, and she went to England and she didn’t like it, so she left and came back home. I lived a lot at my grandparents’ house, which was great, because they had a big piano, and I was in love with my aunties. I was a bit of a mommy’s boy, hanging on to my mom’s apron strings. Everybody would sit around and sing, around the piano and all, and perform, and it was just magical. We went to the Garnerville, and then my mom and dad would go out to their Labour party meetings at night, and I’d sneak out of bed and listen to Radio Luxembourg, fanatically, and hear all this wonderful music, and American Forces overseas, to hear the blues and the soul.
My father went to Sweden on a trade union gig, and he brought me back my first transistor radio. That was heaven to me, to be able to hear music anywhere. It was just fantastic. I did have what was called a crystal set, which you used the frame of the bed as an aerial, and it was old ex-army headphones, and it was very limited. But to be able to walk about, carrying and listening to music, was just magical to me. Lauren Martin It may seem a bit hard to believe, with a lot of the younger people in the room, but it really was, in a lot of respects, the only way to hear music, was through the radio – through Radio Luxembourg and Radio Caroline. What sort of records were you exposed to? I would imagine, not having that much choice, what you were exposed to you either absolutely loved or absolutely hated. What kind of records were really catching you from a young age, listening to the radio? Terri Hooley I remember listening to American overseas broadcasts. It was really for the American troops in Germany. I’m just back from San Francisco, and I heard this record one night… I didn’t know who it was, I didn’t catch who it was. It was called “San Francisco Bay Blues.” “I’ve got the blues for my baby down by the San Francisco Bay, ocean liner’s gone so far away. I didn’t mean to treat her so bad, best girl I ever had.”
It was just an amazing record to me, and it took me a while to find out who it was. It also took me a while to track it down. That was one of the first records, I think, that I ever sent away for.
Eric Clapton did a version on his MTV Unplugged album, and brought that song to a different generation. I found out Bob Dylan, instead with Jesse Fuller, who was a bit of a one-man band… he had actually come and played Belfast, but I was too young to go. Eric Clapton did quite a good version, I must admit, and it turned that song on to another… I never thought I’d ever be to San Francisco, and there I was, just the other day, last week. Lauren Martin Everything comes full circle. Terri Hooley That song, going through my head. Lauren Martin When it came to, you said, the relationship between your mom and your dad, and your mom took you to Methodist church when you were younger, and you’d be exposed to gospel music, and then you were listening to these things on the radio, how did you think, growing up, that had an impact on your tastes as you became a teenager? Terri Hooley I love gospel music. My mom would take me to church on a Sunday morning, to the Sunday school teacher at church. We weren’t allowed to play on a Sunday. We had to wear our Sunday best, and we weren’t allowed to get anything dirty. Sundays were pretty boring. I do actually love the gospel. I think it’s because of my Methodist upbringing; there’s a bit of that in me. I like the singing in the churches. That was the bit of church that I like, was the singing. I used to go to Baptist churches, because they used to have tambourines and stuff. I enjoyed that. I remember one night, going to this Baptist hall, and they’re going, “There’s a sinner here, there’s a sinner here,” and had everyone stand. They came up to me and I went, “No, just totally here for the music,” and never went back. I like a lot of American gospel music. I like lots of music, but what really… I got a job at the side of city hall, in the photographic exhibition. Music and photography were my great loves. I got to know the reps who would come to the record shop on a Friday, and then that was their last call of the week, and they’d give me all these free records… demonstration records. I was just in heaven. I was doing DJing… I started doing DJing when I was 15, in a youth club, and then I started doing DJ, and then I would have a record, which wasn’t released for weeks, and it would be “Terri’s Tip for the Top”. I can remember, it was like Ike and Tina Turner’s “River”, Percy Sledge, “When a Man Loves a Woman”. Every week, I’d have a “Terri’s Tip for the Top”. It was never… “Terri’s Tip for the Top” was never in the top ten, which was amazing. Lauren Martin Very underground of you. I suppose one of the main things that strikes me about you getting into music early on, and feeling an affinity with gospel music, is how that also informed your taste for classic R&B music. I’ve got a track for you, that I was hoping you could tell us a little bit about. (music: The Shangri-Las - “Past, Present And Future”) Terri Hooley Yeah. Lauren Martin Just when it was getting a bit dramatic. Terri Hooley It is the sort of three-minute perfect rock opera. It’s got “Moonlight Sonata”, by Beethoven there. It’s got “A-Tisket, A-Tasket”, and I love Ella Fitzgerald’s version. It’s also like a coffin rock record as well. I was a fanatical Shangri-Las fan, and Ronettes, the Crystals, Supremes, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas; just loved all the girlie groups, the Chiffons… don’t even start me on the Shirelles. Lauren Martin I was hoping to start you. Terri Hooley I used to torture my mom to death, especially with the Shangri-Las. My first girlfriend was killed in a car accident coming back from a party in Bangor. The night I was out, painting anti-Vietnam war, slogans around Belfast, and she went to this party, and she was killed on the way back. I used to sit in the bedroom; I just thought I’d never be with anybody again. My mom used to hear me crying in bed at night. I used to sit in bed, and I’d play this. I was quite a lonely kid. My brother was a bit nasty, and he wouldn’t let me play with anybody he knew and stuff. When I got my own record player, 1/6 [shillings] every week, Kays catalog, Dansette, and I had my own records. I just sort of lived in a sweet world of my own in the bedroom, and the records were my best friends.
I was asked, about 40 years ago, what was my all-time favorite record, and I said “It’s ‘Past, Present and Future’ by the Shangri-Las. I love that record.” I thought, “That’s a bit wimpish. It should have been something like ‘Born to be Wild’ by Steppenwolf or something.” At that time… I would say, if you asked me today, I would say that’s a very personal record for me, and it’s very part of my growing up. I was in New York 18 years ago, and somebody told me… I love George “Shadow” Morton, the producer. He produced the Dixie Cups. He produced a lot of great stuff. Somebody said to me, “His phone number is in the New York phone book. Why don’t you phone him up?” I went, “That’s a bit like a stalker. I feel a bit bad about it.” This girl gave me Mary Weiss’s, the lead singer of the Shangri-Las, number and said, “Why don’t you phone her up?” I went, “I’m a bit shy.” If anybody’s seen the story of Good Vibrations, the deal was to get an autographed photograph of the Shangri-Las, and I never got it.
Mary Weiss sent me an email one day. David Holmes had got in touch with her, and she sent me an email. I was sitting at home on Friday afternoon, and Mary Weiss… I said, “That can’t be Mary Weiss, the lead singer of the Shangri-Las.” I went and made myself a cup of tea, bit of brandy in it, and I sat there, afraid to open it up. I opened it up, and there was a message from her. She said, “Terri, what is it you want me to autograph?” I sort of sent her a few lines, then she sent me a few lines, then I told her why I loved the Shangri-Las. I thought, “I’m writing my life story here. I’d better stop.” We were going to fly Mary Weiss over from New York. Her mother had found, in her loft, an autographed poster of all the band… Some of the band are dead. Mary sent it to me… Sent it to David Holmes, and then we asked her, “Would you come over to Ulster Hall for the opening?” To tell you the truth, if Mary Weiss had come to Ulster Hall that night, I wouldn’t have let her go back to America. She’s still not a bad-looking woman, I tell you. I was madly in love with her. I was madly in love with all the Shangri-Las, but I was a big Ronettes fan, and I used to carry, in my pocket, a cut-out of the NME, was a photograph of Ronnie Spector of the Ronettes. Years later, my good friend John T Davis and I were talking one night, and didn’t he do exactly the same? He had a cut-out photograph out of a pop magazine, and carried it about when he was a school kid… another thing that we have in common. Yeah, it was just wonderful. I never even thought I’d be in correspondence with Mary Weiss. I hope to meet her someday. Lauren Martin Thanks very much for sharing that. I appreciate it. Terri Hooley She could be a future Mrs Hooley. Lauren Martin With any luck. I was also playing that because, like you say in the film Good Vibrations, you agree to pass on your rights, as it were, for the Undertones “Teenage Kicks” for something like £500, a signed photo of the Shangri-Las. I love that, £500 will come and go, but a signed photo of the Shangri-Las is forever. I like that saying. Terri Hooley People keep asking me. It is a funny thing. I was thinking that I would get some copies made for a few friends, and I went to look for it in the house and I couldn’t find it. I know it’s in the room somewhere; I just haven’t looked properly. There’s this room in the house, and if I set anything down, Claire puts it in the room. I go, “I was reading that letter. What happened to it?” She said, “I put it in the room.” Everything’s in the room. I know it’s definitely safe but I’m going to have to… There’s just CDs and records and everything in this room. It needs a good clear-out, but I’ll get to it one of these days. Lauren Martin I can imagine there’s a lot of treasures in there. I was mostly… Terri Hooley I’d say yeah; ten years ago, I was burned out in a fire, I lost an autographed Johnny Cash photograph that I’d got from in London. After Johnny died, I took it down, because people wanted to buy it and I said, “No, I’m not selling it.” It went up in the fire.
Recently, my guys were looking for something else for someone, and then they found an autographed Johnny Cash and June Carter photograph, which I didn’t even know I had, so that was a nice surprise. Lauren Martin Collecting signed photos was as much as collecting records at this point. Terri Hooley I used to be a bit of an autograph hunter; the Kinks, Stones, everybody, when I was younger. Lauren Martin I was partly playing that record as well because pop music, and classic American R&B pop music, is such a fine red thread, as it were, throughout the whole feel of Good Vibrations. It was punk rock, but it had a very pop-accessible feel to a lot of things, and I thought the Shangri-Las was a good example of that.
It was also really interesting how contemporary black music at the time, from the States, was very much a part of your taste, and that informed what the label went on to become. On that kind of note, I’m going to play a track, and hopefully it will spark a memory of you from 1968.
Terri Hooley The ’60s, to me, were just… I was born at the right time, in the right place. I’m 65 now, so I was born in 1940. Just the rock & roll whole thing changed, and then the ’60s, and I think the Beatles… I was a huge Rolling Stones fanatic. Never… I love what the Beatles did, but I’m not a fanatical Beatles fan, but the Beatles did change everything. For me as a teenager, growing up in the ’60s was absolutely just the most amazing experience in Belfast. Rationing was over. People were starting to have a bit of money. Youth culture was really changing. Everything… The music was changing. If you go back and look at the Stones and the Beatles and a lot of bands that were doing covers of American records, and I was the secretary… I was running a folk club, a shebeen in the high street, then it sort of closed down, and Dougie Knight asked me if I’d like to run the blues club in his shop on a Sunday night.
Believe it or not, in the ’60s, on a Sunday, everything closed down. They used to lock up the swings, so the kids couldn’t play. You just couldn’t do anything on a Sunday. We’d run this club on a Sunday night, in his shop. We had maybe five artists on, and it was one and sixpence for girls, and 2/6 for boys, which was my idea. You got free coffee and biscuits and wonderful music. It was a great promotion for Dougie’s shop, but we also put on concerts, and we brought over a lot of American blues artists. The last concert we ever did was in November, 1968, and that’s just who you heard, was Juke Boy Bonner. In Belfast, there’d been trouble, and also there wasn’t any rioting that night, but there was a fear of rioting, and the pubs all closed at six o’clock in the evening, and the town was deserted. We were a bit worried about getting Juke Boy Bonner down from the airport, because we’d heard the roads had been blocked off and stuff. The concert was in the War Memorial building on Waring Street. It was just two minutes away. It’s a venue, it’s just never used anymore. We were all a bit worried, but the blues crowd came out; we had a good crowd, plus the fact it was the only place in Belfast on Sunday you could get a drink. With the blues crowd and alcoholics, it was a good night. Lauren Martin Tomato or tomato, at some point. Terri Hooley We’d done all this food to sell and all; we just gave it away to people. We were waiting to see if Juke Boy Bonner was coming out. We had a friend up on stage playing, and Juke Boy Bonner arrived out. My friend Pauline jumped up and kissed him. It sort of mentions her in the song. I gave him a big hug and was so glad he got such a warm welcome. That was the night that I realized the party was over, and the ’60s was one big party we thought would go on forever. That was the night I realized Bob Dylan’s right; the times, they are a’changing. That was the start of it. The ’70s in this country was horrific. I didn’t really do much. We were afraid to go out. Clubs and bars were bombed, and friends had been killed. We stayed at home a lot and were partying in our house. If there was trouble, people just stayed the night. I was sort of selling records from my back bedroom. It wasn’t until I had this job on Howard Street that a friend of mine… his sister and I had been good friends in the Maritime jazz club, and he was very interested in that period. He came in and he bought a Juke Boy Bonner CD in my shop, and I’d ordered up all these CDs that were about to be deleted. I’d ordered them all up. They came up with a copy of Juke Boy Bonner. I remember when we brought him to Belfast he says, “There’s a track on it called ‘Belfast Blues’”. That must be 15 years ago, and I never even knew it existed. Apparently, Juke Boy Bonner went over to London next week and put it down. I never knew it existed until Colin Carson… It was great just to hear that memory. Because my friend Pauline was raped and murdered in New York… She was my mentor. She was a lot older than me. She taught me to read and write, but she taught me a lot of bad habits, too. I never went back to church after meeting her. I became a right heathen. She took pity on me, because she thought I was care in the community. That’s a three-hour story. I saw this girl one night, she was ten years older than me. I asked to go out with her and she said, “I might see you in the tennis club.” I got all dolled up in my brother’s teddy boy jacket, which you just didn’t wear to dances in those days. I went to the gig, and the girl never turned up. The speaker said, “Are you trying to be hard man?” I said, “No, I’m a pacifist. I don’t believe in violence.” I told them the story, and they sort of adopted me and invited me to this barbecue. The next thing, I was drinking Guinness and brandy. They took me to this house, and there was a party on. They asked me what did I want to drink, and I didn’t know. All I said was, “I’ll have a Babycham,” because that was always on the TV. Pauline just turned around and said, “No, you’re not. Guinness and porter, that’s what you’ll like.” I had the worst hangover ever. I swore I’d never drink again. Lauren Martin Actually, that recording is called “Belfast Blues”, and it was recorded in 1969, so it would have been a year after the gig. It was on his 1970 LP. Terri Hooley Where was it recorded? Lauren Martin I think it was… That was November ’68 that he played that gig, so he would have recorded it a couple months later, but it was on a 1970 LP from some London sessions that he did. I picked that partly because you were the secretary of the Blues Society at that time. Terri Hooley It was the last gig that we ever did, as the Blues Society. It was the end of a decade for me. The ’60s had ended early. It was just a kaleidoscope of color and fashion and freedom. Our Friday night would be, we would go to the Spanish Rooms on the Falls Road, and five or six of us would buy a gallon of cider, and we’d drink it around the entry, and then we’d get 1/6 back on the container, and then we’d buy a pound deal of hashish, and then we would go down to the Maritime Hotel to hear Them. That was just fantastic; one of the greatest bands ever to come out of Belfast, if not the greatest. That was amazing. Many years later I went back with a couple of ’60s musicians to do a bit of filming for The Old Grey Whistle Test, and we couldn’t believe how small it was. It was like the size of this room. Our memory of it was, it was like the Ulster Hall. Mervyn Crawford… He plays saxophone now… He said, “God, look how tiny that stage is.” My legs were shaking going up. We just couldn’t… It was like somebody had built a wee facsimile of it. Our memory of it was that it was huge, but it wasn’t. It was just like this room, basically, maybe a bit bigger. That was fantastic. That was a fantastic club. There were 80 clubs in and around Belfast where you could hear live music – unbelievable. When the Troubles came, there were like two… The weekends were just bonkers. You just didn’t get any sleep. The ’60s was like… Lauren Martin Speaking of Them, I was also, with the “Belfast Blues” track, again talking about the influence of things like the Shangri-Las, the influence of contemporary black pop and R&B music on the sound. I think when you’re saying the end of the ’60s was like a massive social, political, but also a cultural cut-off point, when Belfast really became very insular, mostly not of its own volition. I thought I could play parts of 2 tracks, just to kind of exemplify the influence of R&B on what was happening in Belfast. (music: Rose Mitchell – “Baby Please Don’t Go”) Lauren Martin And then, part two… (music: Them – “Baby Please Don’t Go”) Laure Martin I thought that was a nice correlation. Both of them are called “Baby Please Don’t Go,” but I’d like to think that that was quite a good example of what we’re speaking about; how the big beat kind of rock bands like Them, with Van Morrison, and then the influence of pop and R&B from the wider world. When it came to the end of the ’60s, that very much felt like a cut-off point for you. Terri Hooley Them are brilliant, but they weren’t the only brilliant band in Belfast. There was lots of really great bands, and the influence was American black music, obviously. Van’s father was a big record collector. His mom, Violet, was a bit of a singer. His father worked in the shipyards and was into the blues, jazz, country, so it was where obviously Van got a lot of his influences from.
The R&B explosion of the ’60s was phenomenal. Black artists like John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters and BB King were absolute gods in the United Kingdom. They were hardly heard of in America at the time; it’s hard to believe. In fact, many people say it was the British invasion that brought black music back to America. I used to be fanatical at checking out who wrote the songs and scripts. I love Them’s version of “Don’t Look Back”, the John Lee Hooker song; one of my heroes. “Don’t Look back to the days of yesterday, you cannot live on the past…” When the Troubles started, I started playing that a lot more. My history didn’t start in ’60. My history started around ’65, in the jazz club; that’s my whole history of Belfast, really. There was the political stuff as well, that was coming. I was quite helpful in getting Nina Simone, who was very political, over to do her only gig in Belfast in the late‘60s, when it was the time of the civil rights movement. She was a bit crazy, a bit like myself. I always thought she was a wonderful artist.
Also, a great album that came out was… It’s my all-time favorite record… was “What’s Going On”, by Marvin Gaye, because I was very anti-Vietnam War. That whole album, which the head of Motown didn’t want to put out, and became their best-selling album ever, I think.
I remember reading one of the reviews, and it just said, “This is not a bad album, if you play it.” I thought, “Jesus.” It’s just my all-time favorite record. I could listen to it 24 hours a day. It’s got all sorts of stuff in it; a bit about ecology and all. That was also… I think Barry Gordy, the head of Motown, didn’t want to put it out because he thought it was a bit too political. There was a lot of political black music coming… fantastic stuff coming out of America at the time. A lot of music was, with the civil rights movement in America, you could relate to it in Belfast. We were just talking in the car on the way down here about some music, and about somebody coming over and about the civil rights thing. I said, songs like “Go to Sleep Weary Hobo,” I love, but I always hated “Go to Sleep Weary Provo.” I used to hate the way they’d take a classic American folk song and turn it. The Troubles… I just wonder what it was all about now. It was just complete madness. It looked like our country was having a nervous breakdown. We didn’t go out much. One night, three gunmen… I was coming out of work, and they tried to grab me into a car. Two guys that used to tell me every day they hated my guts, saved my life. Then, I decided to set up Good Vibrations. I thought, “I might as well do something before they kill me.” I’d always been interested in music. I started selling music from my house, then I started doing the markets. Eventually, we got the derelict building in Great Victoria Street. I wasn’t sure how it would go, but it seemed to go OK. We were going for a while, and a guy called Gordy Owens from Sandy Road came in and told me about this punk gig. I went down there, and I was the most unlikeliest person in the world – I really was that hippie. I went down and I heard punk, and I heard the Outcasts play, who I thought were atrocious. They were absolutely dreadful. Lauren Martin That was… Rudi & the Outcasts gig, that was 1978? Terri Hooley Could well have been. Lauren Martin It could have been? Terri Hooley I’ve got Alzheimer’s coming in… I can remember things in the ’60s so clear. I can’t remember what I did last week. I went down and I heard Rudi, and I loved a lot of the American garage bands, like you’d see on a compilation albums; the Saints, the Standells, Electric Prunes. They really did a great version of ? & the Mysterions. I loved all that garage music, so it wasn’t a great jump for me. I liked the Ramones very much. It wasn’t a great jump for me.
To hear something which was really exciting in Belfast, it just reminded me of my youth – going to hear Them and all the bands. I thought, “This is brilliant.” We didn’t have an effective music industry here, so Them and all had to go to England to record and get deals. There was a lot of great bands here that should have had records out. I went up to Rudi, and I went, “Do you want to make a record?” They just thought I was a madman. Nine months later, I was the Outcasts’ manager, with a record label. Lauren Martin That was the first release; Rudi’s “Big Time” was the first release on Good Vibrations? Terri Hooley Yeah. We didn’t have a clue how to put out a record or anything. Lauren Martin It sounded pretty good. This is how it sounded. (music: Rudi – “Big Time”) Lauren Martin It seems a shame to cut off in the middle of a riff, but that was “Big Time” by Rudi. Terri Hooley I don’t know whether it was those speakers or what, but it sounded really good to me. Lauren Martin It’s possibly difficult for somebody of my age group to understand hearing punk, anthologized as it has become, but in the context of Belfast, at the time, there was basically a ghettoization of the city – bars were shutting at tea time. There were no venues open, and there were quite literally barricades. Terri Hooley Yes, a ring of steel around the city center. Lauren Martin A ring of steel around the city center. I was listening to a really interesting BBC Radio 4 interview with a woman recently, who claims to be one of these punks. She said it was essentially a violent playground, between the punks, the RUC, and the army. Terri Hooley Yes. Lauren Martin I remember yourself saying that the punks basically saved Belfast. Terri Hooley They opened up the night life again in Belfast. Jim Cusack, who was the security correspondent for The Irish Times, knew quite a lot, and from Belfast… He said, “It was Terri Hooley and the punks that opened up the nightlife in Belfast.” I’m not completely sure that was true, but we certainly did help. Where we are, in this area… the Harp Bar was just around the corner, which was a shithole, basically. It was a strip club during the day, and they had music at night.
We opened up the Harp Bar, and it really was the first time in a decade where kids… whether they were Protestant or Catholic, it didn’t matter. If your hair was orange or green, it didn’t matter if you came from Mars, as long as you were a punk. Not all punks were love and peace; far from it. There were some right bastards. A lot of people said to me, “If it wasn’t for the punk and all, we would have joined the paramilitaries. We would have killed people. We would have ended up in jail.” It changed a lot of people’s lives, not only my own, but also a lot of the bands, like Stiff Little Fingers, the Undertones. It was just a time of no hope, and punk, to me, was like a little candle; a little light in the darkness, in this sea of madness and sectarian violence and craziness. It was also very exciting. It was really, really exciting. Good Vibrations didn’t have a good musical policy. Some people say, “Terri signed the band up because he fancied their girlfriends, or because they’d bought him a drink one night,” or something. It’s probably true. We hadn’t a clue what we were doing. The last thing we ever thought was that anybody’d ever remember any of this stuff. We just didn’t have a clue. It was all new to us, how you made a record. We sent… Rudi was a band that I really thought should have made it, and I regret… If you watch the film Good Vibrations, because I didn’t put out a record… No, they left us and went to England, and then came back and recorded for us again. I begged them. I broke down and cried and I said, “Don’t go.” A friend of mine had traveled with bands all over Europe. He said, “Terri, Rudi, I think, just jumped the gun too quickly.” We were sort of going OK, and then the Undertones was the big one, and that was just amazing. I went to London, and the first people I took it to was Rough Trade. They were the biggest independent record distributors in the UK, and plus the fact of the label. They’d just signed up Stiff Little Fingers. I went down to Geoff Travis and Richard Scott. I got off the plane, I took it down… I was all excited, and I played them the Undertones [“Teenage Kicks”]. They told me it was the worst record they’d ever heard. I was devastated. We recorded this at the back of the Duke Of York pub in a clothing warehouse in a little studio, for £200, £50 a track. I took it to EMI and a whole lot of other record companies. They all thought it was shit. On the last day… It was my last hope… was CBS. I went in there, and they told me it was rubbish, and I wrecked their office. I was so frustrated. I was so angry. I went around and left copies for John Peel and the BBC. I came back… I went and got trashed that weekend in London. I had a lot of mates. I didn’t want to go home, because I felt I’d really let the band down. I really believed in “Teenage Kicks”. I really thought it was a great pop record, and very radio-friendly and stuff. I got trashed, and I didn’t want to come home.
I came home… I was so disappointed, I’d let the band down. I broke down and cried to my wife. She said, “Maybe John Peel will play it.” That night, he played it, and famously, the first time ever in the history of the BBC, a record was played two times in a row, back to back.
Sire phoned me up; they got my home phone number, and they phoned me up. They wanted to license the record for America, actually; that was the thing. I said, “Look, we’re not really a proper record label, and my job isn’t running a record label. My job is to put Northern Ireland back on the music map, and that’s all I want to try to do.” I said, “Get over here on Wednesday night. They’re playing in Derry.” They came over and I heard them on a Wednesday night. Thursday, they were signed. On the Friday… Peter Powell had put it out as his record of the week on Radio 1, and a lot of other Radio 1 deejays were then playing it. CBS wanted the Undertones, and I said, “Too bad, they got signed yesterday.” CBS, who was particularly nasty to me… That’s why I wrecked their office, said, “Have you got any other bands on the label?” I said, “I have, but I wouldn’t fucking give them to you.” Lauren Martin That’s really, the relationship that you, as Good Vibrations, and you personally, have had with both independent labels and major labels over the years, including Rough Trade, Sire, EMI. It’s very interesting to think of, what is it that… Terri Hooley I don’t actually like the music business. I like the music. The hit record companies, sometimes I think are legalized mafia. That’s why I’ve never had a contract with anybody in my life. I should have; actually, I could be quite rich if I had. Just think, if I had a penny for every time that I had heard “Teenage Kicks” in my life, I’d be able to buy you all a drink. Lauren Martin I ask partly because I’m curious as to what you think at the time, because by the time that the Undertones were really saying… That was like ’78, ’79… Punk was quite an established musical genre. You had the Sex Pistols on Top of the Pops, the Clash were huge. What do you think in particular it was about the Northern Irish punk sound, that people at first were quite rejecting of, and then came to love? Terri Hooley I think it’s sort of a rawness, to some of the bands. You had it in the ’60s, too. If you look at a lot of the bands, it was a sort of rough edge to the music. Also, I think it meant something here, to people. They were getting out of their ghettos, and going to these wee places. Stuart once wrote that no matter which tribe you came from, to go, you had to pass a lot of different areas to get to the Harp Bar. When you came down these streets, 35 years ago, at night, it was as scary as anything. There was just nobody about at all; nobody. It was scary. The Harp Bar might have been rubbish, but when you got in to hear the music, it was just like going to see Them again, for me. I was very lucky. I got a chance to re-live my youth. After Stiff Little Fingers did all the political stuff, a lot of the bands didn’t want to write about the Troubles. They wanted to write what was happening in their life. A lot of the bands avoided writing about the Troubles, which I sort of think, it was a reaction against the Troubles. I think there should have been maybe more political songs at the time. Nobody felt like doing them, because Stiff Little Fingers had been such a tremendous success, with “Suspect Device” and “Alternative Ulster” and stuff. Lauren Martin That kind of split, like in hindsight, it was kind of a thematic split in what was going on in the punk scene in Northern Ireland. You had Stiff Little Fingers, who were actively writing about the Troubles, and then you had groups like the Undertones, who were quite the flip of it, where they were more about, from my perspective… obviously, you can correct me if you think differently… but they were more about a kind of romantic escapism, about their own teenage lives and trying to… I remember reading something from Feargal Sharkey and he said, “There is no way that a one-hour gig is going to squash 400 years of hatred and violence. The Undertones were about escapism.” Does that kind of chime with you? There was almost two kind of sides to it? Terri Hooley I suppose if you lived in Derry at that time, and you were a young person that just went out and rioted every day after school, and the Undertones formed a band. The reason why I thought they were so good in the studio, was because they’d practice and practice and practice and practice. When they went into the studio, you basically were recording them live. They were that good. I think the thing for many bands is, some bands are very lazy. It’s just to practice and practice and practice and practice until you get it right. At the time, Derry being such a violent city, I think being in a band was like a safety net for them; not getting caught up in all this. It’s hard to explain, really, but they were frightened to come down to Belfast because of all the sectarian murders and stuff. Lauren Martin [Inaudible] Terri Hooley Mickey Bradley, of the Undertones, a few years ago asked me to take him around the corner and show him where he recorded “Teenage Kicks”. His memory of it was, they were really scared coming to Belfast. Lauren Martin I was going to say, because the Undertones are from Bogside, in Derry. That was, unfortunately, famously well known in the late ’60s, early ’70s, for… Terri Hooley Yeah, we were frightened to go up to Bogside. Lauren Martin … the sectarian violence, yeah. I was wondering also, the way that the Undertones portrayed themselves, and how people reacted to them. They’re looking back… They’re a very loved kind of northern Irish pop group. At the time, I was quite struck to read that people were really quite hostile to them. They felt they were kind of … They were going against a quite typically Belfast thing of, “You should know your place. I know who you are, and where you come from.” Their kind of aspirational way of acting, was seen as quite an antithesis to that. Terri Hooley The night that I took Sire up, I stayed in Mrs Sharkey’s house, in the guest room, which is like a religious grotto. It was like going to Lourdes or something. I was like, “Jesus, I love all this stuff.” The next day, I went down to get some cigarettes and a paper from the shop, and Feargal came with me. People ran across the road and spat on him. What on earth is that all about? In Belfast, nobody could be bothered to run across the road and spit on somebody. I was really shocked. I was quite taken aback about that. People had put up… It had literally just started… People had put up graffiti, who didn’t like the band. I think they just got used to it after a while. I know Feargal took a lot of flak, personally. There was stuff in the music press about Stiff Little Fingers and the Undertones not liking each other and stuff like that. There were a lot of good bands. One of the bands that I really loved was Ruefrex, and some of their stuff was political. They were from the Shankill Road. If I turned a band down, they used to go, “Terri only signs Protestant bands from East Belfast, which is far from the truth.” I’m not well-liked in East Belfast, so I’m not… I like all kinds of people. We didn’t really know what we were doing, and it was a real cottage industry. We all folded each other’s sleeves. Unfortunately, we went bankrupt, because a lot of small independent distributors loved to sell our records, but they never wanted to pay us. A lot of them went bust, and then we went bust because we couldn’t pay our bills. I was quite glad, eventually. I was sort of quite relieved, but it was about three years of my life that just seemed to be madness and no sleep. Kids would be coming, knocking on my door at three o’clock in the morning with a demo. It was just bonkers. I think I just basically ran out of energy, so I was sort of quite glad. The other thing is, because we were such a small label, nobody really remembers some of the rubbish records that I put out. Lauren Martin Not to pick a rubbish record, because I wouldn’t do that, but there is one particular record on the Good Vibrations label that I find really interesting. It was the only 12” single that you ever put out, and I was hoping to do a little segue into another side of this. I’m going to play this, and hopefully you can tell me a little bit about it. (music: Zebra - “Repression”) Lauren Martin Could you tell us a little bit about that record? Terri Hooley I’ve always been a big reggae fan, since the ’60s actually. In the ’60s, a lot of the older jazz musicians that I used to stand outside of bars to hear when I was a kid – because I couldn’t get in – I got to know. They would go over to England. In those days it was, “No blacks, no Irish, no dogs." A lot of the jazz guys, when they got jobs in England, traveling with jazz bands and working in studios, they lived in the same areas as a lot of Jamaicans. They used to come back to Belfast and give me these 7" ska records. I was in heaven, because I was a big calypso fan. In 1965 or ’66, the Wailing Wailers’ first record, “One Cup of Coffee,” came out. That was Bob Marley’s first record, and I played it one night at the jazz club. It completely cleared the floor. So I had a big interest in ska, was a collector, and set up the Belfast Reggae Society. I did regular gigs up at Queens University every week, and I was in Dublin with John Paley at a 24-hour festival called Dark Space. Some of our bands were playing. The Electric Prunes were playing – I can’t remember everybody. But there was this black and white band called Zebra. John Paley said, “I think we should put out a record with them.” I did. I don’t even think [John] played it. We put out 1,500 copies 12" and we couldn’t give it away [laughs]. Then, a year and a half ago, a Japanese collector paid 700 quid for one. I’ve got two in the house, if anyone wants to give me a bid. I didn’t have one until quite recently. Two years ago, at my annual 40th birthday party, somebody gave me one. And someone gave me their father’s Holy Bible – ex-punk, very religious. Lauren Martin It’s just such an interesting record because Good Vibrations is known as a punk label. It’s fascinating to see an Irish ska band. Terri Hooley We did bring reggae bands. We also brought Shane McGowan for his first gig in Ireland. Shane worked in a record shop in SoHo market with two friends who were in the Esoteric Music Society in the ’60s, Phil Gaston and Stan Brennan. He worked with them. That’s where I first met him. Then he formed a band called the Nipple Erectors. I brought them over for a gig in the Harp Bar. A few nights before, he phoned me up and said, “Terri what do we do when we get to Belfast? Should the band keep their heads down?” I said, “When you get to Belfast, there’s only one thing you need to know, and that’s how to keep your drink down.” A few words I now regret. Then we brought over people like the Fall. I was pretty experimental. I called it the “punk workshop.” We brought over the Monochrome Set in their very early days. My favorite nights in the Harp Bar were our own bands, really. Lauren Martin Also, on the theme of reggae, I know that before Good Vibrations started up you were playing on pirate radio in Ireland, and you were mostly playing a lot of reggae records. There was one night in particular when you were playing in the jazz bar you were talking about in 1965, and you played a Wailers record – “Simmer Down.” There were two quite famous men in the crowd at the time. Do you remember this? Terri Hooley No. Lauren Martin Right. Hopefully, I’m going to jog your memory with the track. (music: The Wailing Wailers – “Simmer Down”) Lauren Martin That’s the Wailers’ “Simmer Down,” but I’m doing a segue into this, because I think this is one of possibly the most interesting, strange stories I’ve heard about you so far, and I wanted to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Terri Hooley I don’t remember it. Lauren Martin We can jog your memory, then. Terri Hooley You tell me a story. Lauren Martin OK, I’ll tell you a story. Two footballers, George Best and Johnny Giles, were in the crowd. Johnny Giles had never heard ska or reggae before, and ran up to you, demanding to know what it was. Through you, he became friends with Bob Marley, which is pretty interesting. Terri Hooley After I treasured Bob Marley’s first record, I wrote to him, care of Trenchtown, Jamaica, and three months later I got a letter back from him. He told me his father was Irish. If you look at Jamaica, and look at the map, there’s places like Antrim Springs and all. They used to send a lot of convicts from out here, to the plantations and stuff, as they did to Australia and all. There’s lots of places in Jamaica that are all named after places in Northern Ireland. Bob wrote back to me, and then we started to correspond, and we didn’t meet until the ’70s. I met him one night, and he said to me… in a flat in Balham and he said to me, “I believe you’re from Belfast?” I said, “Actually, I am.” He said, “Do you know this weird guy, Terri Hooley, who takes his glass eye out and puts it in people’s pints of Guinness?” I went, “No, I’ve never heard of him.” The next day, he was in – it was the time of Catch a Fire – and he was in the office. He was having an argument with Chris Blackwell because he wanted to go back to Jamaica. He was missing his family. He was missing the sun; it was raining. Everything was going great for them. They got The Old Grey Whistle Test. They were getting rave reviews, and I think he wanted to cancel the last two gigs in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Chris Black was saying, “You can’t do this. We’ve got a contract. You’d have to get doctors to tell you you’re ill,” and all.
Jumbo, a guy who worked there came out and he said to the guy, “I get my wages at the end of the month, but we’ve put a lot of effort into this, and I know it would break Chris’ heart if you cancelled the rest of the tour. My biggest problem is, your biggest fan in the world is standing in our press department. I want you to come down and meet him. He’s stealing everything; all the press releases and photographs I could get my hands on.” Jumbo walks in and says, “I want you to meet him.” He says, “I’ve already met Terri Judas Iscariot Hooley.” He says, “Are you taking me for a pint?” Bob didn’t have much money. It wasn’t easy, like you have now, mobile phones to get in touch with him. I had to phone his wife, and she had to go to his wife and tell him about Bob Marley. He sang Bob a song, off “Concrete Jungle”, the first track off the album. Bob was very polite. He turned around and said, “I want you to do me a favor. That was very interesting, but never play one of my songs again.” He was a lovely man. Recently, Stuart and I were down at the Wailers’ gig. I was doing support, and what a disaster that was. There was only “Family Man” Aston Barrett, and I met Peter Tosh, Carlton Barrett, Bunny… To go on as the Wailers to me is an absolute disgrace. It should be done under the Trades Description Act.
I went down, and I did my hour’s set and was done by 8.30 PM, and that was unbelievable for me. It wasn’t half-eight in the morning, for a change. Lauren Martin Just trying to pull through the theme of reggae again, it’s to show the breadth of everything that you’ve been interested in for so many years, and what’s influenced the label. I just find it fascinating that you would start off selling records from your room, then having the record shop, playing pirate radio, even going across the border to play pirate radio, play reggae records. It really is just a testament to the breadth of everything you’ve done. Terri Hooley I used to go over the border every Saturday night, to do Pirate Radio. Famously, on KISS FM in Monaghan, preaching love, peace and understanding into the black North. It eventually worked, but not through my record show. It was really funny. The British army used to stop me and say, “Terri, are you playing a record for us?” I’d say, “You’ll have to write in,” or whatever. One night, they held me back for two hours. They were putting on… the other radio stations were putting on UB40 and stuff, and I went in and I said, “What’s the next record?” They said, “Living on the Front Line.” I said, “This here is very specially for David, Paul and all these guys, ‘Living on the Front Line’ in Middleton,” and that’s where the checkpoint was. The next week, I could have smuggled anything over that border. “Away you go, Terri.” In fact, one night the car broke down, and they fixed it for us. There wasn’t anything against the British army; it’s just like phoning up or whatever. Lauren Martin You’ve always liked to cause a fuss at your shows. I remember, there was one night in particular where you announced to the crowd at the end of a gig of yours that you were going to play the national anthem. They were like, “You couldn’t possibly. You can’t do that.” Terri Hooley The manager of the venue run up, because he didn’t know which one of the two I was going to play. Lauren Martin This is what you played. Terri Hooley It stopped him in his tracks. He was just about to go for me and… alright. Lauren Martin The national anthem. (music: The Undertones – “Teenage Kicks”) Lauren Martin I felt like that one needed the ceremony of being faded out a little bit. It seems a shame to cut that off. Terri Hooley What I didn’t realize at the time… What happened was, a friend of mine, who was at the art college, gave me a demo of the Undertones. I played it and played it, and I thought there was something there. I had a lot of friends come around the house, and nobody liked it. A friend of mine who used to make the best potcheen in Belfast, up in the Royal Hospital, in the basement which was guarded by the British Army… Actually, he was born out in Malaysia. His father had been something big in the army, so he had a security pass. He just made a really good potcheen, but you wouldn’t want to drink any of it nowadays. At half-three in the morning, I was playing the Undertones tape, and Ricky went, “I don’t see what you like about that band.” There were other friends who were in bands in the ’60s, and I thought they would like it, and they didn’t. We didn’t have much money, and I wasn’t sure quite what to do, and I was going to sign up another band. I was going to meet them at tea time. They sort of had a manager in the band. It was a bit like Elvis Costello & the Attractions, and I quite liked them. Bernie came up to me and he said, “I’m going up to Derry. What’ll I tell this band? They’re about to break up if you don’t put out a record.” I thought, “Jesus, I’ll tell you when I get across the road, at the crossing.” I went to tell them we were on the limb, and we were going to do it. I was really worried. I went, “What’ll I tell this band?” They said, “That’s all right. Don’t worry about that, Terri. We’re on our way to London to make it big. Your label will be too small for us anyway.” I was going to relay to them, I didn’t want to disappoint them. Then I went, “We’re not good enough for you?” We brought them up to Queen’s University to play. It was very difficult for us to get gigs. We used to hire out hotels and tell them it was somebody’s 25th birthday party, and then they’d find out it was three punk bands. Lauren Martin You must have gotten barred from pretty much every venue in the city, after one gig at each one, pretty much? Terri Hooley No, we did get barred from Queen’s University for life, because I got all dressed up and I went up one lunchtime, and I went up to the office. I said to this young girl, “My name is Terri Hooley from the Belfast Music Society. We would like to put on a concert in what’s now the Nelson Mandela Hall.” The girl obviously was taking over while the woman who did the job was on her lunch break, and she thought we were Queen’s Classical Society and gave us the hall for £5. I went, “Are you sure this is right?” She said, “No, there’s your receipt. It’s in the book. Nobody else can get the hall.” When Queen’s found out it was seven punk bands called The Battle of the Bands, they tried everything to stop it, and actually had the local Hell’s Angels doing security and all. They tried to stop them getting gear in and all. The bouncers were really nasty. The gig went on, and it was a great gig, and we raised money to set up Just Books, the anarchist book shop on Winetavern Street. It was a fantastic gig, and it was the first time the Undertones came up and played. I think they went into the studio and recorded “Teenage Kicks” the next day. Queen’s gave me a terrible time, so what happened was, the kids didn’t like it, so they put out a few windows at the front of Queen’s. There was no trouble inside the gig whatsoever, except the Ruefrex thought, “This is the biggest gig we’ll ever play.” Everybody had 25 minutes, half an hour at the most, to do their set. You had to prove to the audience you were great in that time. The Ruefrex went, “We’ll never get an audience like this again.” They played outside, just with the Hell’s Angels, and they went up and lifted them off the stage. That was the only trouble we had that night. I got a letter from Queen’s, and I think it must have went up in the fire ten years ago, because I tried to find it when we were doing the book, telling me that I was barred from Queen’s University for life – not for a week, not for a month, not for a year, but for life. Lauren Martin It must have been a bit of a badge of honor to do that, in the name of punk rock, I suppose. Terri Hooley I haven’t been barred from too many places, but I was definitely barred from Queen’s. The next gig I went, the bands… There was some band that was from England, and I think Rudi were playing. It might have been the Adverts or something. I sort of sneaked in the back door. Lauren Martin When it comes to the legacy of “Teenage Kicks,” because it’s perhaps the story of it getting played on John Peel’s show twice, which is the first time in BBC radio history that ever happened, and the legacy of the track… It’s such a familiar track to punk fans, rock fans, pop fans; it’s such a legacy record. When you hear it played out here, what is it about… because you must have heard it hundreds of thousands of times now, what is it about the track now that still grabs you, and is it the same as what grabbed you when you first heard it? Terri Hooley Yeah, I have many versions of it. I have Nouvelle Vague’s version of it, the jazz version. I have Union Avenue who, when I first heard it, I thought it was Johnny Cash singing. It starts off with “Ring of Fire” and goes into “Teenage Kicks”. Many bands have played it, like Green Day, REM did it in concert, somebody else did it as an encore at Tennent’s Vital recently, Kings of Leon or somebody. I can’t remember who it was. It’s just a classic little pop record, really. The drum sound on it, it sounds to me as fresh today, like Rudi did, as it did all those years. It’s just that I’m not all that much interested in what’s happening in the charts at the moment. Lauren Martin Do you feel, as somebody who… you’ve always called yourself hippie and punk rock, as you’re looking back… Terri Hooley I’m a hippie anarchist, to be honest, because that’s what I am. The reason why I call myself a hippie anarchist is because, knowing how everybody likes to pigeonhole everybody, you have to be on one side or the other, and I don’t really have a pigeonhole box for hippie anarchists. I want them to set one up, and then I’ll be in that box. I don’t really know what my politics are. I was brought up very Christian by my mother, and socialist by my dad. I was brought up to believe a lot of things; I believe I’ve got a brother in Melbourne, a sister in Paris, and the whole wide world is mom and dad to me, and we’re all a family of man. We all should look after each other. I’m not the worst person in the world, though my girlfriend might tell you different. I’m sort of, in the words of the Shangri-Las song, “good, bad, but not evil.” Lauren Martin I like… I think that’s a good way to live. I asked how you feel about that kind of record, and how you feel about still being a hippie anarchist. Being so in love with the ’60s, and everything it symbolized, and keeping that alive through the film and your book and everything… do you feel like you live in the past a little, still? Terri Hooley I do. I live in the past. Lauren Martin Do you think that’s for better or worse? How do you feel? Terri Hooley In two minutes, this will be the past. I absolutely have to have things to look forward to. Last year, I did the Electric Picnic, and I was very nervous. It was sheer… it went down well. In fact, it went down fantastically well; 3,000 people in the tent, going bananas, and me on stage running around like a three-year-old child, but with a bottle of whiskey. Lauren Martin That’s quite an image. Terri Hooley That was just brilliant, but [I thought] I’ll never be invited back. They sent me a letter saying… an email saying, “We were very much inspired by your set, Terri, last year. We’d like you to come back and do a bigger stage this year.” I thought, “Jesus.” I wasn’t feeling well, but I was really looking forward to doing it. I didn’t get to do it, because I had a very bad chest infection, and then I went off to Barcelona to do a punk gig, and then did nothing. In fact, Stuart took me home one night, because we both did a DJ set on a Tuesday night. Thought he was never going to see me again; I was that bad. I came back from Barcelona, and I opened my emails, and there was an email from Electric Picnic saying, “Terri, I heard you were very ill. Hope you’re feeling better, and by the way, you’re the first person we booked for the Electric Picnic next year.” I know I’m going to be alive for another year, and that is what is going to keep me alive, is knowing that I’ll be back at the Electric Picnic. I always have to have something to look forward to. You’ll not be getting rid of me just yet. In fact, I had my second wake in this building, and last January I had my third and final wake. I think I’ll be pushing it to have another. It was a journalist who said to me, “When are you having your third wake?” I said, “I’ve had two. I think it might be…” He said, “The bloody two that you had were great.” Lauren Martin Yeah, I think… is that the last bit of time? Have we got time? Terri Hooley It’s about… Does anybody want to ask me anything? Lauren Martin Yeah. Terri Hooley I’m not that frightening. You don’t have to ask me anything. Lauren Martin No, we don’t ordinarily do it, but I’d be happy, if anybody wants to ask any questions; anybody? Terri Hooley Do you know what usually happens, and this happens all the time. People – especially when I was out in Cologne – the people were frightened of me. Nobody would ask me any questions. I started to ask myself questions, and then answer them. I did it in London. That was the funniest Q&A ever. Is anybody buying a drink? Any future Mrs Hooleys with a big bank account? No? Lauren Martin You got £500 back in the day. You were doing fine. It was just a mention to see that there is a screening of Good Vibrations, the film about Terri and Good Vibrations, on Sunday at the MAC. If anybody’s interested in seeing the film, and seeing a bit more of the context of everything, you’re more than welcome to go. Terri Hooley I’ll never understand why they couldn’t get somebody good-looking to play my part – somebody that didn’t drink and curse and be a madman and disgraceful. Lauren Martin I heard Michael Fassbender was a bit busy. Terri Hooley Originally, it was going to be Michael Fassbender. All my female friends were going, “Geez.” Richard Dormer did the pilot, and he was absolutely brilliant. He had me down to a T. He’s just amazing. We would have had the film out quicker… We worked very fast like that. I turned down two contracts ten years ago before. It really took 15 years, from beginning to end, to get the film. I never thought I’d be alive to see it. When I did see it I thought, “I really like this film. It’s really good, warts and all. It doesn’t make me out to be an angel, because I haven’t been an angel in my life. I haven’t been that bad, but I haven’t been an angel.” I’m very proud of everybody who worked on the film. We had a great team. Nick, the editor, said, “We had a fantastic film that lasted two-and-a-half hours,” and it broke his heart to cut it down to 93 minutes. I was really surprised at people like The Belfast Telegraph. If anybody has seen the film, Belfast Telegraph has had insiders in the music industry say, “This film’s going to be big.” When the film came out I said… It had a half page in the Telegraph; “If there’s one thing you do this weekend, you’ve got to go and see Good Vibrations, the best movie ever to come out of Northern Ireland.” I’m very delighted with the success of the movie, for not only the directors, David Holmes, the producer, Chris Martin, and everybody in the film. The film’s been shown all over the world. The best reaction I ever saw for the movie was, believe it or not, in Moscow. I was out there for Irish week, and they built a bar called the Hoolygan Bar, asked for my book. That wasn’t a plug for my book, because I don’t even have a copy, and I’ve never even read it. Lauren Martin It’s not a plug, if it’s a plug. Terri Hooley I did DJ in it, and I let the Moscow punks take over, and it was just amazing. I really enjoyed Moscow. They were so enthusiastic about the movie, and they stood and clapped for ten minutes, and cheered. They’d all got free Guinness and Irish whiskey beforehand, so I think that might have been a part of the reason. Lauren Martin I think that might have helped. Terri Hooley They clapped and clapped until I got up and spoke to them. I was absolutely in tears, because I didn’t expect a reaction like that. It was a bigger reaction than we got in Belfast. “Maybe he’s all right.” Lauren Martin Just another little thing; before that, there is Daniel Holmes’ short film. It’s a premiere of The Light of My Eyes, which is on 50 minutes beforehand, and it starts at three; I forgot to say. It’s three o’clock tomorrow… On Sunday afternoon. Did anybody want to ask any questions at all? No? Were you kind of hopeful for some? Terri Hooley I’m dying for a pee… Lauren Martin Hold on, I’ve got one. You hang tight. Audience member How are you, Terri? There’s a great scene in the film… it’s more a question, did it happen in that particular way, where you’ve kind of made up your mind that you’re going to open up the shop, and I think it’s kind of the IRA come together in a bar, and you rock on in, sit down, and throw the records on the top. It was kind of more simple, when it happened… did you kind of hand-pick the records in the hope that, “I’ve picked some really, really good ones,” or did you just pick all the crap that was lying at the bottom of the basement? Terri Hooley Actually, there was a brilliant drawing in the Irish Independent or something, or the Sunday Times, and it talks about, these guys came around looking for protection money. Somebody had given me all these demo records that they got, and there’s all these Philomena Begley albums and Irish accordion albums and stuff that we had in the shop. I used to say, “There’s no money in the till. Take those records, sell them, and then you’ll get some money.” The cartoon was of a guy with a balaclava in the bar, buy one of these albums, or else. Lauren Martin You did have to… Obviously, that was in the film, but you did have to persuade the paramilitaries on both sides, essentially, to leave the business alone, because also it was on Great Victoria Street, and it was the most bombed street in Europe for a while. Obviously, opening up the shop was quite potentially a fraught process. It wasn’t just like opening the doors. There was a lot more politics to it than that. Terri Hooley Yeah, that’s the way it was. Dave [inaudible] and I had been friends, and when I was doing hippie magazines in the late ’60s, and we’d try to set up in 1971 the Belfast Arts Lab, sort of building like this, and it had enormous success. There was eventually an Arts Lab set up, it didn’t last long. The thing that came out of that was the printing press that Dave had.
Richard, we were trying to get a building, and eventually we got the shop in Great Victoria Street. I wasn’t sure whether the record shop would work or not, and it was just a hub of activity. You looked back at some of the footage in Shellshock Rock, and it was just so many kids in there on a Saturday. Bands were formed in the shop, and people met in the shop, and got married. It was a good shop for partying in as well, because we had all the good music. It was difficult, and then Michael [inaudible], he had to leave the country, and wrote a book about his travels. We were both threatened, and I didn’t leave. He says, “There was a time when Terri and I used to go and talk to the IRA, and the UDA and try to get them to see a bit of sense, and then there was a time when it just went, “Don’t ever come back, and you’re our enemies.” It was basically that. It was quite… it could be quite nervewracking sometimes, working there late at night, and hear the banging on the door and all, looking out the window, seeing who it was. There were times when people hit me and stuff like that. Years later, a lot of paramilitaries have apologized to me for things that happened in the past. I haven’t been attacked for a couple of years. I love the ceasefire, because I used to be attacked every month, and the old bones can’t take it anymore, to tell you the truth. I’m more frightened now. I’m frightened of my girlfriend, actually. I’m more… People say about how brave I used to be and all. I just think it was insanity, really. I’m not very brave these days. I love Belfast. I live and breathe this city. I would say, in San Francisco, as an old hippie, I thought that it would all be wonderful. I didn’t really like it at all, and I was so glad to get back home to Belfast. I really love Belfast. I love people from northern Ireland, and I’m very proud to be from Belfast, but to tell you the truth… I think people here are very generous, and are very caring. It’s just the bigots and the racists that I don’t like, but you have to deal with them, too, I suppose. I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else in the world. I never have. I always realized, as a younger person, especially when the Troubles came, and a lot of friends… We had 40 friends, and we were called the tribe. I was the last man standing in Belfast. Everybody got up and left … poets, artists, musicians. I always felt that when I left, one, I would never come back, and two, I would feel like a traitor. Also, I love Belfast. It’s so exciting. It’s such a small city, and there’s always something happening, especially now. 35 years ago, I wouldn’t be invited to one gig a week, maybe a Saturday afternoon in the pub. Now, I’m invited to 300 things every week in Belfast. I just wish I had the energy to go to most of them. A lot of them, admittedly, I wouldn’t want to go to. There’s so many young and exciting bands here. I’ve always said this, from the ’60s, that Northern Ireland is such a small country, we have the best poets, musicians, performers… more than anywhere else in Europe.
Somebody phoned me up… Van Morrison’s ex-manager phoned last week and he said, “I just had a couple of new bands. You’re absolutely right. I know you’ve been saying it from the ’60s – we have absolutely fantastic talent in this country.” You think of the people that come out of the country… Seamus Heaney, Paul Brady, who Bob Dylan says is one of his favorite songwriters, Van Morrison, all the people. Lauren Martin I’d like to think for most people, you are on that list, for modern Belfast history, definitely. You’re saying that you’re proud of Belfast, but I’m sure Belfast is very proud of you as well. Terri Hooley The Belfast City Council… Lauren Martin … maybe not so much. Terri Hooley They used to try and ban my concerts and all. I was a pain in the ass to them. I laugh when they used to try and ban my concerts in Ulster Hall. The IRA were blowing up a city, the Shankill Butchers were butchering Catholics, and they thought punk was a threat. A couple of years ago, they just agreed to put up a plaque for me, and they called me a cultural icon, the two-faced so-and-sos. Lauren Martin I suppose being immortalized, that is extremely fitting, because you are quite literally a part of the fabric of the city. Terri Hooley The funny thing is, when we were doing all this, nobody ever thought that this would last, or anybody would ever remember it, plus the fact that many a time, we thought we would never last the week. Terry Gleason, the artist, said… Terry lived on the Ormeau Road, and if you walked down the Ormeau Road on the right-hand side at night, it meant you were a Catholic. If you walked down the left-hand side, it meant you were a Protestant. Terry and his merry band of men always danced down the middle. That’s one thing I’m very proud of; I never took sides. I just couldn’t really… I did argue with [a friend] about working-class people going out and killing working-class people, and stuff like this. I’m just really glad it’s all over. It was horrific days. I don’t really want to be reminded of them. Belfast isn’t quite the way it was in the ’60s for me. It’s become very corporate. A lot of the old shops, the old book shops, of course we have to move on. Belfast is, to me, quite exciting at the moment. We’ve gone through a really dark period, and you just couldn’t get bored in Belfast, at the moment. It’s just so much going on – in fact, too many festivals. Lauren Martin There is a… you’re DJing tonight as well, aren’t you? Terri Hooley Yeah, with three house DJs, and I’m really, really worried about it. I’m like a fish out of water. Lauren Martin Where is that again? Terri Hooley Aether and Echo, and it’s ten o’clock. I think I’ll go on first. Don’t ask me what I’m going to play, because I haven’t a clue. Lauren Martin If you fancy carrying the party on, you can come and see Terri DJ with everybody else. I think we are going to have to wrap up. I could listen to you talk all day, but we are going to have to keep track of the time. Terri Hooley I hope you weren’t too bored, with all I’ve said. I wouldn’t come along and listen to some old eejit talk about this load of old nonsense. Thank you, Lauren. Lauren Martin Terri Hooley, everybody. [Applause]

Volcov
Enrico Civellaro started the Archive label in 1998 after finding inspiration from the records of Carl Craig and Kirk Degiorgio (and the table tennis tables of the Reinforced Records office). Hanging out with dance music mavericks like Dego and Domu, Enrico began putting out collector-friendly records by Nubian Mindz, Nu Era, Theo Parrish, Opaque and others. A hook-up with a reggae soundsystem in Milan meant Enrico could also throw parties, and invite friends like Ian O’ Brien and Titonton Duvante. Enrico’s quality control means that Archive and Neroli only release tracks that pass the test, rather than falling into the month by month routine of running a business. Speaking at the 2004 Red Bull Music Academy, the artist known as Volcov drops stone-cold advice about where his priorities lie when running a label including management, swapping CD-Rs and how to do a remix as fast as possible.
Hosted by TORSTEN SCHMIDT So, welcome a young man from not so far away. VOLCOV Verona, Italia. TORSTEN SCHMIDT We have to be really specific about these things as we learned earlier on last week. VOLCOV Verona is a city right in the middle of Milano and Venezia, in the North. TORSTEN SCHMIDT He goes by the name of Volcov, but he is also known as Enrico. That’s what your mother calls you, right? VOLCOV That’s my name, yeah. So I’m a DJ, I produce under a few names. One is Volcov, one is Isoul8, that’s more like house. One is a project called Rima, which is something I do with Domu, who’s going to do a lecture later. Also, I have my own label called Neroli, which I started a few years before and another label called Archive, which I’m still managing and doing a bit of A&R for it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT How are all these things related to what is going on in current Italian dance music? Where do you position yourselves? VOLCOV I’m totally out of the Italian dance music system, you know? For example, my labels are not distributed in Italy, just some independent music stores that buy stuff from English distributors [carry our records] and I rarely DJ in Italy. I used to have a club night in Milan until a couple of years ago. We had a five year long club night, but then I stopped for... well, a generation change, shall we say. The clubbers who came to my parties were older, and the music wasn’t really appealing to the youngsters, so I decided to stop. Apart from that, we’re not really relevant to the Italian market, and I don't have many relationships with other artists or DJs or producers from Rome. I know there’s good DJs and good artists, but somehow we never crossed paths. I’m more down with some of the artists and friends from London or Germany. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So there’s some kind of a cultural diaspora there? VOLCOV Well, with the label, when I started, I just put out the music I liked. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Which was? VOLCOV Well, artists like Dego from 4Hero, Domu from the early stages, others like Alex Attias, a few different artists. We didn’t really check for nationality or whatever, it was just the sound that I liked and we just released it. There are artists from Italy, of course, it's just the sound was not what I was looking for. So nowadays it’s really difficult, we’re going to speak about how the market is really difficult. To give demos a chance you really have to be super strong. Back in the day, five or six years ago, you could take one production which was alright and sort of build from that with one, two, three, four singles and get enough sales to break even. Now the production has to be top quality from the beginning, otherwise it won’t succeed in the market. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you started putting that stuff out, there was a time when you could literally get a Dego record every other week on some label from somewhere. What was your personal approach to have yet another one? VOLCOV Well, at that time, when I started it was when the 4Hero album came out, so it wasn’t that easy to get a Dego record. He was doing 4Hero mainly, which was the album Two Pages, which was a great album. Well, it won the Mercury Prize, innit? Or it was a finalist, but it was generally accepted by the underground and the average English listener, let’s say. And then he was doing some underground tracks for labels, there was this label 212... Anyway when I started, I just wanted to try something a bit lo-fi, and bit different, you know? And so we started - well, I’ll play you something - the very first release on Archive was something by Nubian Mindz, which was a drum & bass producer from Reinforced known as Alpha Omega, and he did... TORSTEN SCHMIDT So what was your connection with London anyway? VOLCOV Well, I was living in London. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Why did you live there? VOLCOV Well, I was writing my thesis at that time at university. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What did you study? VOLCOV Economy and marketing, and so my passion was music. I was just hanging out at Reinforced and that was the music I liked anyway, and I started to meet Dominic (Domu) and some of these other guys. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So someday, somewhere in London, the pigeons were strolling around Trafalgar Square... VOLCOV We were playing table tennis at Reinforced and everyone was checking tracks and at that moment it was drum & bass or jazzy stuff, or house. We wanted to release some stuff that was kind of in the middle, and to give these drum & bass producers a chance to do some other shit. Both me and Dego started our labels, Archive and 2000 Black around the same months, and with the same distributor. Then, when we changed distributors, we were together with Goya, which we still are nowadays. The music has changed as the years have passed on, but we’re still doing the same kind of thing, with the same attitude, you know? TORSTEN SCHMIDT But when you speak about attitude and names, 2000 Black’s inspiration was obviously drawn from the Fela Kuti and Roy Ayers track, I guess. VOLCOV It’s just a name. Well, it was a regular night with drum & bass, so when we arrived we started playing the different music, and people were a bit surprised. But after a while they got down, as long as it got groove. And the soundsystem in that place was really something. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Was it yours, or was it the clubs? VOLCOV It was theirs, it was a sport place where they do reggae on Saturdays. So we had like a reggae soundsystem and that was really famous for drum & bass. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So, what would be your advice for people who aren't lucky enough to have a reggae soundsystem right around the corner? VOLCOV Well, to start a party yourself is always the best way. If you want to make things happen, you have to do things your way, rather than wait for someone to book you and make you a resident. If you’re lucky, you're lucky, but it's best to start your thing with your mates and do it. Nowadays with the market, you can be a producer, but it’s very difficult to make money out of production, because the budgets are very tight. You can use the productions as a promotional tool to go out and DJ or do gigs. So, to be involved in a club night is good, and good for connections ’cause you can get people to come over from abroad to play for you and you can do an exchange and go abroad. I’ve seen many DJs as residents who are doing their own parties and become in-demand. TORSTEN SCHMIDT By doing a good job and spreading the word. But if you play devil’s advocate at this stage, what if I find someone with loads of money, get him to book all the DJs I wanted and, if I do a good job, then of course word will travel? VOLCOV Well, you could do that and it could work, but I don't think it’s something that would last, you know? I think you have to start step by step, very slowly. I mean, when we started we were offering decent money to the artist. Most of them were friends that we knew, so they were happy to come down and play. If you have a guest who comes down just for the cash, or you have a friend who comes to have a party, you can see the difference in the way they DJ. So at a certain point we had two guests from abroad, just because we wanted to hang out, like Dego, me and Alex Attias, Ian O’ Brian and Titonton, just because we were friends and wanted to hang out and play together. Everyone got paid a little less, but you can see the interaction in the night. But the funny thing is, when we do these parties it’s like no promotion at all, no flyers – just word of mouth. There weren't e-mails like nowadays. That’s the beauty of e-mail, everyone has e-mail nowadays. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Now it’s a lot more about playlists of clubs... VOLCOV Yeah, it’s full of internet DJs now. People request their playlist and they act like they’re famous ’cause they’re in everyone’s mail boxes, you know? TORSTEN SCHMIDT There seems to be a lot of that playlist CD-R thing, that, “Hey, I’ve got something you don't have” – thing going on, especially in that scene. Why is that? VOLCOV Well, people seem to be really cool because they play the latest CD-Rs. I think that went a bit too far, you know? Because if you have the latest tracks on CD or whatever, and you can't really mix, or do a proper set with a certain logic or give emotion to the crowd [then people can tell you're not a proper DJ], even if you have the latest tracks. Also, if you have a phenomenon especially like last year, where people were starting to copy tracks and send them out to people. Like, for example, Dominic or me go to play somewhere, we give a CD of some recent productions to someone, some guy or some resident, whatever, and the guy maybe makes a copy and gives it to a friend, you know? “Oh, just keep it to yourself,” and then all of a sudden your tracks are in Russia! Sometimes, if there’s a problem with a release, it’s not that we don’t want to release the stuff on time, it’s just that there’s factoring times and money problems with the distributor not paying, the record comes out maybe nine or ten months after a track is done. And so with all these people playing tracks on internet radio, charting it and stuff, at the end when the record is in the shop, it’s a bit of a problem ’cause people think, “Oh it's old, I heard it all the time too much.” So I think it affects the market, a small market, so more and more DJs should stop giving out CDs. It’s not a form of disrespect, we know people get excited about the tracks and want to play to friends, and give it to people, but it’s affecting our little scenes. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What are the numbers anyway? VOLCOV It’s hard to tell because everyone pretends to be selling so many records, you know? “Yeah I'm selling a lot of stuff.” But the reality is like even big labels who used to do like house stuff, like 8,000 or 10,000 copies, now they do 2,000 or 3,000, if the track is really strong. In the underground labels we used to do 2,000, but now it’s more like 1,000. But, if the record’s not strong, and you need to sell 800 copies at least or people will start to think of your label, “Ahhh...[makes disparaging noise].” Sometimes we do just 500-600 copies. It’s really tough. If you do your own stuff on your own label, at least you do 500-600 copies, because you can break even and get your music out. But, if someone is signing a track, he has to pay a bit extra money, he has to pay the distributor, he has to pay the artist an advance, and then it sells like 700 copies or whatever, it’s a bit difficult. Me, I do this by myself, I do this in my spare time. I don’t do a mail out, so I don’t spend money on the mail out or promotion, I just concentrate on signing good tracks, stuff that I think is good and take it from there. I wait for the DJ to do the marketing and word of mouth kind of thing. So I try to keep the expenses as cheap as possible, and I’d rather spend 100€ more on label design ’cause I want the product to look good, just for myself not for a fashion item on the shelf, but because I like the product to look good, you know? And I like to give 100€ more to the artist or the singer so we can build on it from there, rather than spend money on promotion. Nowadays, you can see big labels of our scene selling less copies than an independent label, you know? ’Cause at the end of the day, people have less money to buy records, and when you go to the shop you really buy what is really heavy for them, which is good because small companies are maybe selling as many as big labels. We know this by fact. I’m signed to some projects with other labels and I’ve seen the quantities and sometimes it’s crazy. With no promotion we’re selling more copies than stuff that I produce for big labels that have more people involved and promote tracks out and everything. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So just forget about everything? VOLCOV No, I just say to people going independent is great because you have total control on your stuff. And personally, I think that the more difficult it is on the market, the more you push yourself to do a better product. So there’s a selection nowadays, there used to be so much crap on vinyl, a waste of vinyl, really. Nowadays, I think the quality around is a bit better ’cause otherwise people lose money. Simple as that. So it’s sort of a cleaning out. TORSTEN SCHMIDT A healthy process? VOLCOV Well, it’s a healthy process, but still we want more people to be involved. The problem is that some distribution companies are going bankrupt. That’s affecting the labels and the labels really have a problem taking risks. Like, for example, a recent phenomenon is the remix, like a good way of making money – you do your own label, your own productions and then you get asked to do remixes. Same thing with gigs you get a bit of cash doing remixes. But nowadays, no one has money to spend doing remixes, so it’s all a swap thing. You do a remix for someone else, and the other guy does a remix for you and release it on your own label. This is great, especially if the artist offering you the swap is an artist you like and trust, but otherwise it’s not a great deal, really. TORSTEN SCHMIDT But also we’ve heard a lot of these swaps not happening because the artist agreed on it and some management jumped in and goes: “No, no, no, you’re not on an equal kind of plane, so you need to put this on top.” So it takes ages before something really happens, or has this smoothed out now? VOLCOV To be honest, I think it’s really funny to ask someone more famous than you to do a swap. It’s not like you have to say, “I'll give you a remix and 357€ top up.” I think it’s rubbish. TORSTEN SCHMIDT It’s a little bit like playing golf. You know, with a handicap? VOLCOV Yeah, but if you both trust yourselves, then you can make the deal. Otherwise forget about it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So, management? VOLCOV Management is a strange thing, anyway. Some don’t understand, they try to stick to the business. But in music there’s some little in-between things, that maybe just some people are into the music, you know? TORSTEN SCHMIDT Did you ever have the feeling that your studies helped you? VOLCOV More the down-to-earth approach to the business, yeah. TORSTEN SCHMIDT How do you get a down-to-earth approach to studying economics? VOLCOV I never had the fantasy, like, “Oh, this DJ's played my song, so I'm going to sell fucking loads, I'm going to do great.” I always thought, ”Oh, it’s another record, another thing to listen to in the car, it’s cool, let's make the next one.” So, I’ve always kept my feet on the ground, even through my job and I’ve tried to do music in my spare time, produce when I have time. I never count on this [music] 100%, so this way I’m free to never compromise on quality. I can just release one song, if I think one song is really great or really deep, I release it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Yes, that’s the ideal scenario, and probably the subtext here is “reality check,” or something similar. But you’ve been talking about a lot of different aspects and about how you want to do them all on your own. But how do you manage to fit all that plus the regular job into one week? How does your week look like? VOLCOV Well, I work every week, some email business to run things, or to get in contact with people sometime in the night, whatever. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What’s your day job anyway? VOLCOV Well, I work in a family company now, we trade in fruits. So, it’s waking up quite early and finishing late in the evening – but at the same time, I have my space to send some emails, to go the post to send some CD-Rs. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So is it more of a hands-on thing, or more like an office job? VOLCOV No, it’s an office job, so I still have time – and weekends I’m travelling for DJing or when I’m not DJing, I’ll go to the studio. So, I try to finish songs very fast, usually in two sessions. Like, I’ll do a demo and then during the week I can let it breathe, listen to it in the car, and then in the next weekend or in a couple of weeks, boom, go and finish it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT You say you try to, what does the actual process look like? VOLCOV Well, it really depends on the songs, if you're inspired, you know? For example, remix stuff is always a bit difficult ’cause there might be some stuff that's really inspiring you, and the remix comes out – bang – ’cause you really like the parts you have. Sometimes the lack of good parts is a bit tricky and you have to push yourself a bit more. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What are you looking for in the parts? VOLCOV Nowadays, just vocals. If I have to do an instrumental remix, it’s a bit tougher because I know I’ve got to change everything from the drums and the bassline’s going to be different, unless there are some instruments like flutes or horns or guitar or something. But instrumental remixes are a bit more tricky. Or you have to replay a brand new track and you replay the melody of that song sometimes, you know? Just to give an idea, but I’ve done remixes to be honest where I just didn't use any sound from the original. ’Cause sometimes people ask you to do [release] a 12", and you know to do a 12" is like two or three songs. And because of the scarcity of time, if I do a 12", I’d rather do it for myself for the label, or just keep tracks for my albums. So you end up doing a remix for some songs that I don’t like and you do a brand new track. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Why do you do it then in the first place if you don't like it? VOLCOV Because you like the guys. You have a connection with them, you go DJing with them. They’re so nice and enthusiastic so why not, you know? I think it's really important to still have some good relationships with people, you know? And if people make sacrifices for the music, I’ll always respect them, you know? TORSTEN SCHMIDT So you do remixes for people you like, or tracks you don't like and... VOLCOV No, there might be a track on the label that I’m not really mad about or there’s not any parts I can use for the remix, but I mean you do a version. It’s like a song you know? I might use some of the bongos... TORSTEN SCHMIDT It was the same computer... VOLCOV Yeah, I use the same program. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Did you ever get any grief for that? VOLCOV No. If you do a good job, the artist is happy. But if you get a vocal track of the artist, then it’s easy, it’s better. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Coming back to the remixing of your own tracks, is it easier? VOLCOV Yeah, ’cause you go to the studio in a certain state of mind, or you’ve been listening to certain tracks in the car, or playing tracks the night before DJing, and you’re up for just going to the studio to jam. I mean, I come really fast with tracks, and the way I work is to get a groove going. Then recording loads of stuff, like percussion and shakers, loads of Afro/Brazilian percussion and stuff, so you get a groove going really fast, you know? Then you sort of write a melody and then you decide on the structure and the following session – or you take a couple more sessions ’cause you want to write a vocal or you invite a vocalist to join you on the song. But I have a feeling that the best tracks we’ve done, we’ve always done in very little time. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Can we hear one of these best tracks, then? Show us the quickest one. VOLCOV The quickest one is a remix we’ve done with Domu, actually. I think that was the quickest. Actually, it was a remix for Dego, who didn’t give us any parts, so we replayed the bassline, and we found this old hip-hop sample and we resampled from the same source. (music: Dego - unknown Rima remix) The original was much more minimal, so we just played the bassline and put the groove around it. The same three notes, so that’s like three hours work. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So it was more in the spirit of the reggae version? VOLCOV Yeah, we just found this break from Atmosfear, actually. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Atmosfear? VOLCOV Yeah, and we just jam on it. We play the bassline, find the samples to do the scratch kind of thing, and just edited it, you know? The sound sounded just right, at that moment and we never retouched it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Never looked back. VOLCOV This is another, which is like a mix I done myself, with some vocals. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So is it quicker when you work on your own? VOLCOV Well, Domu is very quick. Ha, ha! TORSTEN SCHMIDT So what’s the story here? How do you communicate about it? (music: Volcov - Unknown) VOLCOV This is more like my house project. And this is done with the process of just getting a groove, recording all the shakers, get the samples, chop some of the vocals. It’s a very fast approach. ’Cause the vocals were right, inspiring, you just click and do it. A good suggestion I can give to people is don’t get stuck on one song, and play it over and over because then you don't really get the right attachment to it. You wake up, you still have it in your ears, and it’s really hard then to decide what to cut and what to change because you still got just that thing in your head, you know? Loads of young producers do one song and they think it’s great and they do it for four months and sometimes they live with that track. Sometimes you should just do one song, leave it for a while, come to it after and think, “Hmmm, this is good, maybe I'll change that a bit,” and do more stuff. And if something’s not working and you push it a bit too hard, then maybe it’s time to change stuff, try a new song, you know? Because the best things usually come very quickly. Because it’s a smooth process. TORSTEN SCHMIDT How do you keep up the mental energy that is needed to create the origin of the sound? I mean, when you close your eyes while listening to this, you would not think of Italian teenagers on the piazza, you would not think of the Friday night club with a lot of hot-looking people. I mean, you're thinking of big soundsystems and dancefloors, sweaty people, some kind of New York set up. Clubs that probably don't even exist anymore. How do you put yourself into that state when you're doing the music? VOLCOV Well, the more I go on, the more I get older, the more I try to make songs, you know? So I do stuff that I want to listen to in my car, you know? This is like on the edge - quite clubby, but still got the song approach. But the stuff I’m working on now, the house album as Isoul8, it’s really like songs which have a 4/4 formula, but not too formulaic, they’re still are good for listening. But as I told you, I’m not really bothered about the Italian market or how it is. I can hang out in a cafe with my mates, or at the same time go to my room and make a dirty song for a dancefloor in Detroit or whatever. I think it’s just the passion about music that moves you, you know? You see, if my friends don't really like my music... I mean, I’ve never really tried to give CDs to my friends, it’s like, whatever is to his taste. I’m not pushy, not at all, you know? That’s why I don't really do much marketing or promotion on the stuff. I like the stuff to arrive in the shops and let the people judge and usually there’s the guys who always work at the stores, and who give suggestions to people and they like what we do. In Japan people are really into it. The only reason we do the Japanese market is because people are really into it, so we take the time to go and tour and do these sorts of things. Maybe I send CDs to the guys at the stores when they do pre-orders. But apart from that I just let the market decide whether it’s good or not, you know? TORSTEN SCHMIDT With certain sounds, certain distributors are associated with it. How important is it for you to find the right one and be a part of it? VOLCOV Well, I’m with a distributor called Goya, and I've been working with them since the very, very beginning. And Goya is always associated with the West London broken beat scene because, well, it is in West London and most of the labels came from that area. I started working with them six or seven years ago and mainly because I used to buy records from this label called People. And People was distributed by this company and was actually owned by this company, and I was freaking out cause the records were so deep. I needed to get my records out through the same channel. So I went there, and at that time Goya had just left People, and Mainsqueeze, which was IG Culture’s label, but was just at the very beginning, and the Bugz in the Attic guys started the Bitasweet label with their first release. So I went there, I saw the people had the same vibe and liked the same music as me, and I thought, “Let's try it.” Dego joined a few weeks later and I convinced Alex Attias to start a label called Visions. Well, he already wanted to start a label, but I convinced him to join the same camp. And we were doing our things and there was a time, when we were being charted by everyone and seemed to be being very successful. We were selling alright, but we’d hear of people around us selling much more than us. Even though their records were never charted and didn’t seem to have the same appeal to people. But in the last two or three years, with all these distribution companies going bankrupt, and the natural selection I told before about the quality, it seems that we always sell the same amount of copies and the other distributors and other labels are suffering more. So I think the quality policy that Goya had paid off, especially over the last two or three years has shown good results to sticking with your own sound. TORSTEN SCHMIDT A couple of the few remaining distributors are swamped with stuff, ’cause people who were with others have literally been taking lorries of their stuff and carrying it over to the other one. Did all this turmoil in the distribution scenario affect you at all? VOLCOV No. You know, when you’re creating something, if I was starting now, then maybe yes. But the labels have been running since seven years and one since four years, so you have your own niche with people. If you deliver a certain quality, then people will go and buy your stuff, or at least go to the shop and listen to it. Maybe they don't buy it, but from the numbers I can see these core people always buy the record. And then there’s a larger audience that sometimes buy it, depends on the release. I didn’t see any change really, in terms of sales. I guess if someone has to start with a label it’s harder now ’cause there’s just a few companies, the companies can’t take 15,000 labels, you know? Otherwise, we don’t do a good job. When you go to a distribution company, you have to be sure they can work your product. They have to be interested in your product, the seller has to be, “Yeah, I like this.” When he calls the guy in Switzerland he has to be like, “Buy 50 of these,” and the buyers like, “No, I'll take 20.” “No, buy 50.” So, if he likes the music, and if he's convinced, then he's going to do a good job. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Have you dabbled with any kind of internet distribution so far? VOLCOV No. I was one of the first to try and do a website, which was more than just the usual... TORSTEN SCHMIDT You were not the first. VOLCOV Well, we tried to be a bit creative with the website. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What did you do? VOLCOV Well, we did some funny galleries with some of the people involved, and put as many information as possible on the releases, and tried to change the graphics all the time, and keep it visually interesting so you don’t get bored surfing. I never really joined any MP3 company or anything. Now there’s a famous one, the case of one company selling MP3s of all possible labels without any permissions, so it’s a big thing nowadays. Last week everyone was talking about this. We want to make a little webstore to sell our release. Just for people who want a release but can’t find it in the shop, then I’ll send you the record kind of thing. But because I don't have much time, it’s taken me a little bit to do it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So for someone taking so much pride in the actual physical appearance of the record, how does something like joining iTunes appeal to you? VOLCOV At the moment, I haven’t really thought about it. I still like to have the real product in my hand, so I just want to communicate that with people. The only thing I’m doing sometimes is two special deals, mostly with the 12"s. Now, when we do albums, what I do is a special edition for Japan, we do certain EPs on CD for Japan, but new technology at the moment, like ringtones or iTunes, I’m not really interested. With so much music, I don’t think people are going to start to look for this little underground track. If it’s an album, then maybe you can think about. Like, if you want to download the whole album, but... TORSTEN SCHMIDT Thinking of albums and Goya, Goya is literally situated on the back of a pretty large compound, which is owned by Virgin Records, so you got the two worlds literally back to back with each other, and now with the Bugz [In The Attic] being signed to V2, what do you think is going to be the outcome of that? I mean, major’s policies have kinda changed too. VOLCOV But it’s really strange, you know? The year we released the Domu album on Archive, we did pretty well with that. It was Goya distributing that, and we decided as a policy to do a special price for Japan where the record was supposed to be big, and that paid off ’cause we sold more than 2,500 copies in Japan, which for an underground [release] is very good. And, if you compare it to the market nowadays, it’s very good. And at the same time IG [Culture] was releasing his New Sector Movements album on Virgin and the record is great, for me the album is amazing. I was like, “Wow, this is great.” But they didn't market it properly and there was a great cover, they spent money on it and everything as a product, but they didn't do much to support it in the right way. I know the record sold less than Domu. And you think, “Virgin? Selling less than a product that could have been with Goya and it would have sold more.” TORSTEN SCHMIDT But, what’s the right way? Especially with Bugz, they’re a bit like the Wu-Tang Clan of West London? VOLCOV Bugz have a different sound, you know? They have a sound, which is a mix of elements. But to be honest, the sound has changed. The early sound was different from what it is now, ’cause some of the people involved are in different projects. So now they have a sound, which is more booty or bassy, so it will appeal to the larger audience, but it’s not exactly the old West London sound or the old Goya sound. Of course, everything is developing, I'm not so old-school that it has to be that sound, but...

Van Dyke Parks
Van Dyke Parks is an arranger and composer best known for writing the lyrics to a certain lost classic by the Beach Boys – but that’s not even the half of it. His first arranging job was on The Jungle Book (his addition, “The Bare Necessities,” scooped an Academy Award nomination); and back in the ’70s, he started the world’s first record-company video department at Warner Bros. In recent years, he’s woven his expressive arrangements around the music of Rufus Wainwright, St. Etienne, and Joanna Newsom, for whom he orchestrated her second album, 2006’s Ys. Parks’ music, by turns elegiac and psychedelic, stretches into the bygone age of a lost America and bursts into the wide-open plains of whatever he chooses to do next.
In his 2013 Red Bull Music Academy, Parks delved into the art of arranging, the Smile sessions, his work with Skrillex, and much more.
Hosted by BENJI B It really is an absolute special honor for us to be in the company of such a
musical wizard and legend. Please join me in welcoming the amazing Mr. Van
Dyke Parks. Van Dyke Parks Well, I’m not the only wizard here. I know that we’re in a sea of wizardry. I
know that, and I appreciate it. BENJI B So you selected that piece of music to kick things off today. What was it? Van Dyke Parks There were 800 copies of a record just released for Record Store Day. And
that is in that record. It begins an album called The Super
Chief, which is to document my trip. An instrumental fantasy, as
it were to document my first trip to California in 1955, on the Super Chief,
the great luxury train. It took me three days to get from Princeton Junction
to Pasadena, California. And that was the first piece from that fantastic,
grandly irrelevant piece of music I wrote, called The Super Chief. BENJI B And there’s definitely a cinematic theme in a lot of your arranging. One of
your first breaks was actually working in the movie business, am I right? Van Dyke Parks Well, I don’t know if you call that a break. It might have been better to
study engineering, or dentistry. But I chose music early and I went to a
boarding school in Princeton, New Jersey. Outside of Princeton. At that time
it was called the Columbus Boy Choir School. And I was immersed in music from
a very early age. I was the youngest of four boys. We all played instruments.
My first real instrument was clarinet. My brother played trumped, another
played French horn. The oldest played double-barrel euphonium. So we made a
racket at every Noel. We’d go around and we’d play our way through
neighborhoods and in sometimes freezing weather. I was the only one with a
wooden mouthpiece, so I felt rather superior and fortunate. If you’ve ever had
brass on your lips in a snowstorm, you know what I’m talking about. So music
was it. And to support that tuition, my father was a doctor. Much of his work
was for nothing but for the love of mankind, which I don’t think is a misspent
aim. We had to raise the tuition. And I came into New York City repeatedly, in
the ’50s, to support my education in music. And it’s all about music for me.
It’s the highest math. It’s what brings us together today. It leads to the
song form, the most portable piece of cultural baggage we can carry. We don’t
even have to pick it up. As long as it has melody, pardon me, a through-line,
it needn’t have melody. But sometimes it does, and when it does, it can escape
with you as you exit a room, with a fantastic and powerful memory. So I think
music is very butch. I love it. It brings musculature to my every social aim.
And sometimes it’s a velvet glove with a strong fist enclosed. Sometimes it’s
a consolation prize. But music has such potential to realize everything we
want of the human spirit. Let’s not be bothering Jesus with all this horse
shit, but you get what I’m saying here. I believe so heartily in music. So
those that are here that might suspect that it’s other than a glorious ride, I
guarantee you it’s worth it, as I enter my eighth decade. I swear to that. BENJI B And one piece of music that definitely, I think it’s fair to say, brings us
all together in the room, because I would find it hard to believe that there’s
someone here that hasn’t been touched by this moment in their life, is one of
the very first things that you worked on. (music: Terry Gilkyson - “The Bare
Necessities”) Van Dyke Parks Alright. That was 1963. [applause] 1963, I got my first union job. That was the year... we had a Cold War. We had
been recovering from Nikita Khrushchev banging on his shoe on the dais of the
United Nations. We were in a Cold War. Unfortunately, my brother was in
Frankfurt, at the vice-consulate of Frankfurt. And he died that year. And to
get to his funeral, I got a job. And they gave me money to arrange that piece.
I got a black suit and a two-way ticket to the grave. And if that isn’t a
burning bush, if that isn’t God in action, I don’t know what the hell is. And
that was my first job. Basically, a glorified rhythm track, but it gave me the
idea that there was money in music. And that’s something I just found
phenomenal. So, 1963, that was the year Bob Dylan came out with his first
album, The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan. That was the year The Rolling Stones co-opted the American delta blues in 12 x 5. That was a sea change in music.
That’s when everyman could sing. Sprechstimme [‘speaking voice’], the thing
that I’d learned as a child in the boy school, by people like Schoenberg, was
now on the street. Anybody could sing. If he could play a guitar, he could get
somewhere. And so I went from the coffeehouses that I’d played since ’62, I
went up and down the coast of California. I went into the studio and started
exploring the opportunities in a studio. And that really became my laughin’
place, the place that I loved to be. That’s where I wanted to remain. Because
I’d drawn a distinction between performance music and recorded music. I did
that in 1948. I was 5-years-old, and I heard a Spike Jones tune, called
“Cocktails For Two,” filled with
ear candy. Tuneful percussion. Things that I’d heard, like, only through
Sousa, on parades, as people
marched down the street in earshot on American holidays. Now it was in the
studio, and tuneful percussion became a very important obsession for me in
recording. It still is. You notice, with “The Bare Necessities,” you’re
hearing a room sound. You walk into a room and the people that – probably was
the first take – people look at music and they start playing together, and the
room sounds. Well, technology of music, and I’m just starting to talk about it
animated itself into a real sea change. Right about that time. About 1963,
’64, we went from three-track to four-track tape. It was a big deal. And I
knew there was a difference between recorded and live music. From going from a
piece where the room sounded to a piece in which you could impose different
perspectives on acoustic instruments. A mandolin might be triumphal in the
foreground, in the face, with a wall of brass blowing their brains out in the
background, because of micing. So, tell you the truth, I was at the right
place at the right time to participate in all that wondrous journey that
studio technology brought. And this hour, I figure, with your indulgence, I
will stammer my way through a discovery of where that led me. All kinds of
interesting places. That proves, once again, that production – that is, as a
credit – is a failure in engagement, in contrast to arrangement, and really
participating. Where you can define the proscenium of a piece. You can exalt
what is humble. You can articulate what seems to the casual observer like a
fuzzy, far-off event, as small as a YouTube download. So that’s the end of the
sentence. [laughter] BENJI B I think that sentence deserves a round of applause. [applause] So, obviously, we’re a room full of musically-minded people, from all
differing backgrounds of production and taste. But one thing that I would
really love you to expand on in today’s talk is what you just mentioned, which
is the art of arranging. And maybe while we navigate through that, you could
think of a few musical examples we could use to show, really, your experience
in arranging. And maybe talk us through the process of what being an arranger
is. Van Dyke Parks Well, music seems to me like a tremendous remedy. Almost like the last thing
on anybody’s mind. In film work, it’s the last thing done. In a vertical
hierarchy, all the money is spent on blowing dust around, making people up,
spending money on contracts, getting an extra trailer for a diva who just
didn’t want to be so close to her male co-star. Maybe falling out of love
during an embrace in a picture. All of those problems can only be reconciled
with music. So music is the great remedy to me. And it is also in arranging
for basic tracks. Real interesting to me that two things are involved in the
recording process, usually, although events now are stampeding ahead of me and
I am in a state of perpetual wonder about whether Spotify is spotless, what’s
happening to fractional profits in music and so forth, and how to position
myself as a mere survivor in this new era of music. I understand it far less
than anybody here. But in my experience, two things happen that are very
interesting in the equation of arranging. An extemporaneous process might meet
head-on with a pre-meditated event. So you might come up with a bass, drums,
and guitar, and a vocal, that need somehow to be – pardon me – enunciated,
clarified, confirmed, in their certain truths and excellence. And somehow
maybe, like, cosmetically cured, with distractions that only a good
arrangement can offer. It’s not true that an arrangement should always just be
felt and not heard. Sometimes an arrangement should definitely be heard. And
I’ve made great mistakes in miscalculating. Just as a personal aside,
something that I think is very important to say: you must reserve the right to
fail if you’re gonna get anything done. You must continue aggressively to
reserve the right to fail. You must keep learning from your failures. I see
that. I see how shy I was. When I could afford to be shy. Because I was a
brunette, and I had time to be shy. But soon you’ll tire of being shy, if you
are shy at all. If you’re that victimized by the degree of self-loathing
coming from your last failure. But you must continue to forgive yourself and
reserve the right to fail. So, what happens is, the extemporaneous process
then meets what’s pre-meditated. Arranging, to me, isn’t something like the
design of a camel with a committee. Basically, everybody’s gotta get lost
while you think about what it takes to arrange. You’re holding the bag. It’s
your job. You cannot, with the power of dialogue, do anything to ameliorate
the crisis that is imposed on the arranger. You must face that alone. It’s a
monastic process. And that is what I love about it. That it is collaborative,
but it’s also terrifically solitary and confining. Hermetically sealed, in the
case of my work a couple of days ago before I took the red-eye to Red Bull –
my first red-eye, by the way; interesting, life is so full, always something
new – but I did an arrangement in two days. But it felt like it could’ve been
a year. I was so frozen, immobilized, in front of a computer. I no longer
write because of an injury, from over-writing. Everything now is through
sequencing, by the way. I use Digital
Performer in my work as an
arranger. It’s a Luddite’s last refuge. I do it because it’s what I learned,
and many, many things come into play in arranging that improve the facility,
the speed of the event, but there’s always an important ingredient in that.
With that speed, comes the need for hesitation between inspiration and
execution. So, often I find myself doing even up to 24 bars, and I’ll finish
that, drink some wine after I’ve finished the meal and cleaned up between
every preparation – my wife thinks that “cook” is a noun – so between all of
those events, I might get up the next morning and just wipe out that 24 bars
and move on. So, I allow myself an arrangement of a song, and if you all are
interested in a song form, and surviving as an arranger, and I recommend it, I
allow myself five days for an arrangement, no matter whether it’s a banjo and
a Jew’s harp or an entire orchestra with a lot of vertical responsibilities.
Everybody has to have something to play. But I take those moments between
inspiration and execution very seriously. You must have time to give pause
while doing an arrangement. But both of those things fascinated me, you see,
the business of extemporaneous work. If you go on YouTube and you look up my
name – it’s Van Dyke, is my first name – and go “Ry Cooder.” If you punch in
the word “Hollywood,” “Ry Cooder Van Dyke Hollywood,” you’ll see a filmic
event that is absolutely... it’s gonna knock your socks off. It shows you how
I get, occasionally in life, to participate extemporaneously, and how much I
love it, how much joy it brings me. But that isn’t the luxury I usually have.
Usually, it’s sitting at home frozen in front of a computer and doing an
arrangement. I’ll tell ya something. I think it would really be good ...
what’s the next thing that’s up there? OK, so I go on from one thing or
another, but I finally get an opportunity to do what I do best, and that is I
like to articulate everything in strings. I use a lot of strings. I know it’s
very retro. But I love strings. To me, that’s heavenly engagement. I don’t
play a fretless instrument. I spent one semester in school on a cello, and it
was a painful experience for anyone who came close. It wasn’t until my son
played violin that I actually got a stringed instrument in my house. But this
shows what I do most commonly. This is an early attempt at an arrangement.
“One Meatball,” on Ry Cooder’s first album, which I co-produced. It’s called
“One Meatball,” the record Ry Cooder. (music: Ry Cooder – “One Meatball”) Arch-liberal. Kind of left-wing, liberal, tree-huggin’, Commie-sympathizin’,
lyrics there, from the Depression. All about the difference between being rich
and being poor, and I’ve been both in New York City, I guarantee you that. So
I understood the piece. And sometimes you notice that the violins at the top
would support the melody, of a person so circumspect and so in doubt about his
vocal ability that I felt it was appropriate to strengthen the melody.
Sometimes I do that with the first violins. Now, it’s interesting, are any of
you interested in string arrangements? OK, here’s the bit. This is what I do.
This is what I’ve found. I didn’t make this up, nobody taught me this. But
this is what I do. I always record with three violin lines. I divide them.
Three violins, two violas, one cello, and one bass. That’s what I do all the
time. And the reason for that is because, you see, with these five voices up
there, the three violins and the two violas, I can have triadic events, I can
have a line or an octave-duplicated line at the top, holding the thing
together while these three interior voices, that would be the third violins
and the two violas, all have a triadic opportunity. So what are you doing with
strings all of a sudden? These strings are getting bold and beautiful. There’s
a physicality there. [imitates a line] You don’t have to have a drummer
going [sings a drum fill]. You don’t have to keep returning to the ubiquity
of the trap set to get some rhythm. Maybe even if you put some rhythm in your
strings, a drummer can find a way to lay back. And still be involved, with
great economy. So that’s what I found out. Three violins, two violas, one
cello, one bass. Well, unfortunately, a violin is an instrument of infinite
approximate pitch. And if you put two violins together, you’re not really
doing them a favor, because you’re inviting intonational problems. So you must
have three. That unifies the field and it starts to sound like a note.
Sometimes that note is slightly out of tune; what the Brazilians call
“desafinado.” Agreeably out-of-tune. But that, to me, is the irreducible
minimum for an orchestrating with an arranger who wants to bring the heat of
the street into the parlor to meet the elite. [laughter] It’s nine violins and six violas, one cello will do, and one bass. My love for
strings, it was so born of my own intimidation about the fact that I’m not a
real musician, that everything I get musically just comes from blood, sweat,
and tears. I sweat bullets to come up with everything. It’s all due diligence
with me. I want to prove to you what this secret knowledge... going to a boy
choir school, learning music, listening to a lot of dead white guys, doing the
drill, crying a lot, not getting laid, being lonely, being a musician, it was
tough. To get the experience. To even enter the field of arranging. I want to
show you where all of this knowledge paid off. And the academic results became
clear. Please play “Good Vibrations.” One cello. (music: The Beach Boys - “Good
Vibrations”) So I went into a Beach Boys session, without any employment opportunity, went
in there, and thank God, it occurred to me to suggest that a cello play.
Tripletize fundamentals on the chorus. With a bow. And Brian Wilson reached
in the control room – with great control, he had; such great control, and the
gift of mutual empowerment, which is a requisite for any good musician – and
he got on that control button and he said to that cellist, who was somewhat
puzzled that he was looking at an empty music stand, and he said, “Jesse” – it
was Jesse Ehrlich was in the band a generation beyond us – “Jesse. Barko.”
Jesse looked up from the music stand. “Barko?” He said, “No, Brian. ‘Arco.’
With a bow. Arco, with a bow.” And this is what happened. And it became like
the ruby slippers that clicked in the The Wizard Of Oz. The signature shot
for that piece. And that got me eight months of infamous employment as a
lyricist. So you never know where music’s gonna take you, either. But that is,
you see, the power of the rhythmic potential of a string section. In that
case, it was just one player. But it speaks worlds about the physical
possibility in string rhythms. And I really love that world. It’s second
nature to me. I feel like a boy and a dolphin. When I go into that world, it
gives me all kinds of flotation. I just love it. And recommend it. As the
beginning for all your ideas. Now, how do I get there? You might be interested.
Let me give you a trade secret, the one I use. I was once a pianist, an able
pianist. I do everything in front of a keyboard now. I would be lost... I know
a great arranger, Lennie Niehaus. He does halftimes at Super Bowls and endless
numbers of play-ons and play-offs at Academy Awards show and so, a great tenor
sax man, and has insinuated himself into jazz literature, arranged for Stan
Kenton on a bus, with nothing else. Lennie would do an entire orchestration, I
watched him in process, and he would turn the page to the next four bars, a
full orchestra, and not have to look where he had left a flute, a second
flute, or a bassoon. He just kept going. Maddeningly talented. I don’t have
the problem of talent. I take a long time. But I find that it just disgusts me
how people privatize knowledge. I decided not to do that. I try to give away
what it is that I paid dearly to learn. And here’s such a lesson. If you’re a
pianist. You know, some of my favorite music of the American scene, and I had
one lesson conducted by Aaron Copland, for example – I mean, I’ve had some
great opportunities – somebody asked him, “What is American music?” He said,
“Well, it’s anything that was written in America.” Which I think is a
wonderful way to just wrap it up. It came from America. That’s what American
music is. So I think that there’s a desperate attempt to brand all kinds of
maverick music, whether it’s in America, of America, or just McWorld, which is
the American hegemony in its most giant, inappropriate form. The way to get
there, from here, in an arrangement, if you’re using strings – and then I’ll
wrap this up; I’m starting to sound like a dweeb, aren’t I? I don’t wanna
sound like a dweeb. I wanna be very hip. [laughter] But the way to get there is, if you’re a pianist, my favorite American music
is, let’s say, Gershwin. And my favorite Gershwin is, let’s just say, “Two-
Piano Gershwin.” And what you get in “Two-Piano Gershwin” it’s available
anywhere. I would listen to that if I were you, to see what happens in two
piano assaults. Very interesting, because you get a very detailed and specific
articulated left hands, and you also get all the decorative qualities that are
available in tenor events and so forth. This is the way I construct strings. I
get, basically, two treble-bass-braced pieces of information, and I study it.
And it’s from that that I deduct the strings. So, like, everything below a low
C is wiped out as I study the viola possibilities. Then everything below a low
G is wiped out as I study the violin possibilities. So it’s then, with
deductive reasoning, that you find yourself able to quickly – I mean, when
time is the money of love, and deadlines are deadly – this is an easy way to
get where you’re going. And I recommend it. That you try that technique, to
get quickly through a string arrangement. BENJI B You touched on sort of classic American-sounding music, and of course, it is
very easy to just say, “Well, that’s any music from America,” but you have
been on record as sort of having a direct reaction against what you call the
Anglo-cization of music in the ’60s during the sort of Beatlesmania that was
going on. And if you could pick a style of music that was classically
American, I mean, you could do a lot worse than picking out The Beach Boys as
a classic sort of American sound. Seeing as you raised this classic
Smile session, which is probably one of the most folkloric recording sessions ever,
a lot of people said that, you know, had this album come out at the time, that
it would’ve been the American Sgt. Pepper’s, or the equivalent. Could you
paint us a picture of what it was like going into that environment, how you
met Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys, and really what those recording sessions
were like? Van Dyke Parks Well, like I said, I mean, to wrap it up, what I learned was not so much
musical as it was social. The social lessons turned out to be absolutely
indelible. To see somebody, in this case, you see, I think the fascination is,
those who give a damn about anything pre-Elvis, the younger, looking back on
this, the most indelible impression I have is what came out of it as a social
lesson in how to make music. One guy was in charge, and that guy, he was the
most incredible... I mean, in terms of tonnage, he was the most powerful man
in music production. As a songwriter, publisher, group leader, arranger and so
forth. He sold more records than anybody. He was the top dog in the American
pop music scene. And I define “pop” as something that happened after popular
music died. And in that year, 1963, that year that Andy Warhol came out with
his Campbell’s soup can, all the arts went pop. It was a big deal in music, of
course. So being in a Beach Boys session was very much like that. All the
extemporaneous processes were played. The good thing about it is the usual
suspects always showed up. So, there were people that had played together,
there was a sense of what you call “repertory theater,” musically speaking.
Everyone had played together. They had a tacit relationship that was still
very dynamic. Everyone respected everyone. And they also expected the
unexpectable. And that’s what I remember about [it], a much-unexpected event
took place. I found myself once on my hands and knees playing the organ
pedals. It was just too much velocity was required. I had to. But you’ll hear
one of those organ notes in “Good Vibrations.” It’s almost sub-sonic. It’s
just too hard to find. We don’t need to go search it. (music: The Beach Boys – “Good Vibrations” take #3 outtake) [comments over music] But you notice there’s an economy in the ideas, you
see. This is chamber music, in a way. So I found that chamber sensibility very
refreshing. What it took was the ability for the musicians to go along gladly.
There was no time to feel superior. Nobody had time to feel superior. And I’ve
learned something from that. You see, I escaped serious music by getting into
un-serious music. Now, you see, you don’t have a problem with that. I don’t
believe you have a problem with that. I think you will find that you can be
taken seriously, even if you’re doing music that you might think is just being
thrown out there with feel-good potential. I think this is very interesting.
But when I was coming up, there was a definite demarcation between serious and
un-serious music. I wasn’t going to be serious about Edgar
Varèse anymore. I found
possibilities of musique
concrète right in that, if you
listen to “Good Vibrations,” just before that glottal “ah” that “ah” that
hit, where the tape is cut. I found musique concrète in popular music to be
much more interesting. I found non-serious music to have this political
potential. That it would make a difference to be involved with music to which
people were dancing, or communicating thoughtlessly. And to me that became the
hardball game. The one I wanted to be swinging in. And, in short, it was a
great opportunity. I was at the right time at the right place. BENJI B And you wrote most of the lyrics on that album, right? Van Dyke Parks Well, yeah. I wrote most of the lyrics. I found myself to be a lyricist, but
still able to make a musical contribution. And I don’t eat light bulbs. And I
do believe that old caution, that “by no title, merit nor honor is any true
man elated.” And I think that that extends to women, too. I think titles are
an absolute folly, when it comes to trying to figure out what comes from a
collective endeavor. And what I love about that music and, darn it, just about
everything that I’ve done in music that I can think of right now, it’s all,
ultimately, a collaborative confirmation. Isn’t that interesting? BENJI B Let’s go further on that, and the difference between taking someone’s idea or
someone’s creation, and then doing your interpretation, i.e. arrangement, on
top of that, and the difference between being an artist yourself and the
creative pressure that comes from having to do it all from scratch. Because
after the Smile sessions were sort of abandoned, you recorded Song
Cycle. Is that
correct? Van Dyke Parks Yeah, well, when I went on to a record called Song Cycle, and they sat on
it for a year, and it was ignominiously put on the shelf, and then it appeared
somehow, almost in a piratical move, on a juke box in Greenwich Village. I
went out and got an electromechanical reproduction of a coin going into a
machine. It reminded me of the time that I first put nickel in a jukebox. That
was called “Memories Are Made Of This,” the first time I ever put a nickel in
a jukebox. So I wanted the coin to go in, and then at the end, of course,
because I learned that it’s possible to turn tape around, the coin comes out
at the end. This I eviscerated, that is, I made waste of a beautiful diatonic
– a do-re-mi thing – that was written by a very unpopular, Donovan was his
name. They thought he was a Bob Dylan wannabe. And I felt kinda sorry for him,
but I was absolutely impressed by his piece, called Donovan’s
“Colours.” And I had at it, and
this was what came out of my madness. (music: Van Dyke Parks – “Donovan’s
Colours” / applause) So yeah, but it’s like Ted Turner said, “It only looks easy.” I had to start
with an ostinato. I didn’t know where it was going, I didn’t know when I would
return to it. But I started with a repeated figure on that simple tune called
“Donovan’s Colours.” The marimba, I thought, was very able. But nobody told me
that by having the tape speed, I might reach an octave. And I learned that
seat of the pants. And so I played the marimba part at half-speed and then
brought it up to speed. I wasn’t afraid to show my madness in that piece. I
wanted to follow it wherever it would take me. But I had been in the Mothers
Of Invention, and I had seen crazier people working out... BENJI B Which was Frank Zappa’s band. Van Dyke Parks ...Frank Zappa’s group. So I had no fear of being considered insane. And
Warner Bros. got the results of that single record; I did it under a pseudonym
‘cause I wanted to protect my family from the infamy of my musical
criminology. I wanted to protect them, and I put that record out as George
Washington Brown, a fictitious pianist from South America. [laughter] They wouldn’t permit me to sign on at Warner Bros. with an album, so I used my
own name after that. BENJI B I mean, the majority of that music at that time that you were involved with
does feel very experimental for the time. And pretty trippy, almost. I mean,
was it quite a psychedelic time at that period? Van Dyke Parks Well, I had some psilocybin. But I never participated in this LSD stuff
you’re talking about. And I don’t understand it when people talk about
psychedelia. They don’t know what they’re talking about, but it’s a good buzz
word. [laughter] Look at “Ice Capades” and you’ll see. This took me to the Moog synthesizer. I
was one of four boys in town that had one, and I did these commercials. And
this is when there was no keyboard. There was just a phalanx of wires, and you
put them together. You started out with pink noise. That is every “hhhhh,”
every sound in the audible spectrum. And you came up with a note. And maybe
that note would be, well, if it were an ambulance, it would be a sawtooth
wave, with a sine control voltage. You’ll hear what came out musically, where
this desire to experiment in the studio took me, in this Moog music. (music: Van Dyke Parks – “Ice Capades (Moog Music ‘67)” / applause) It was tough. It was tough. It was tough. It was tough. That was for a
commercial for Ice Capades. I actually did teach the synthesizer how to say
“Ice Capades.” And you go into a parking lot now, it says, “Please take the
ticket.” And you take artificial voices for granted. But in those days, I was
just thinking about the medical potential. This was before I even heard the
word “Stephen Hawking.” I thought that this might really have some serious
applications. I had too much to do to be psychedelic. I had to keep a roof
over my head. And I had to be an arranger, and I arranged for a lot of people.
Why don’t you play the one I did for Bonnie Raitt? This reveals my love for
calypso. (music: Bonnie Raitt – “Wah She Go
Do”) BENJI B So that was your work with Bonnie Raitt. Van Dyke Parks Yeah. BENJI B And just going back to the album we played before, Song Cycle, which is
referenced by so many artists through the decades as like a really critically
acclaimed body of work. It’s fair to say that it’s not as commercially well-known as some of the other artists that you’ve worked with. I thought it’d be
interesting to talk a little bit about the difference between being the artist
and also being comfortable, as it seems, playing more of a background role in
music. Van Dyke Parks Well, “background” is a bad word to use. “Sidelines,” I think, is a good word
to use, OK? When you’re an artist, you can do anything. You only must be true
to yourself. And that truth shall make you whole. If you’re just true to
yourself. But when you’re working for somebody else, Jesus doesn’t give a damn
about that. You have an obligation to somebody else, and to serve them and
their expectations, however heightened they may be. So it’s the absence of
personality all of a sudden comes into play. You find that in film scoring,
especially. Being nobody is often very important, than trying to be somebody.
Being interested is essential. Being interesting is dullsville. I learned
that. I learned it the hard way. I became a record artist. All of a sudden I
found myself punished critically by being myself, being true to myself. But
ultimately, what I learned by being an artist brought me into such
understanding, I mean, that I became indispensable once present, to a lot of
people, in making their cases clear. Isn’t that something? So that’s the
difference to me. One is by being somebody. The other is by being nobody. BENJI B I don’t like pulling up things that people have said before, but one quote
that I had to write down, was that you said, is that: “When somebody blew John
Kennedy’s brains out in the face of fame, I realized there might be some value
in anonymity.” Van Dyke Parks That’s right. I think anonymity is a blessing. And it gives you a chance to
stop worrying. I mean, I’ve seen a lot of famous people. I don’t know, there
might be a lot of you who think that fame is indispensable to the very idea of
surviving in music. I don’t think it’s important. I’ve seen so many peers,
people my age, who spent a lifetime getting famous, and I see them walk into a
crowded room with two terrible things on their mind: one, what if everybody
notices me? And the other: what if nobody notices me? So it’s a problem, this
thing about fame. It looks to me like it’s the hangnail on every social
situation. You just: why do it? I don’t understand it. And anonymity has been
a blessing to me, as I’ve pursued this arranging career that I’ve had,
principally. I think it all shows that everything has served further my desire
to be part of the team. To be a good beta male. This is what I like about
arranging. It’s reactive more than creative. But I can’t really tell the
difference between those things. But I would say, by being willing to be
reactive, you get so much more done than if you’re in peril because someone
expects something creative out of you. And that applies to self-analysis, too.
By the way, just to let you know, I have pursued cliché so much to try to even
make it an art form. That’s part of, I think, what is my signature. To try to
just almost get to the unsueable offense, in quotation. I’ve wanted to be a
pirate. But you can’t really make a living being a pirate. You must do
something special with these stolen goods, these references you bring, in if
you’re going to become an artist in cliché. You saw what I did to Bonnie Raitt
on that song, basically that is a testament to women’s empowerment. Looking at
that field of calypso, which has been such a big part of my life, having to
follow a calypso steel band in a coffeehouse in Southern California, I learned
so much about good rhythms, real rhythms, not imagined rhythms, rhythms that
came from Africa. Look at this, I finally got where I wanted to be as a
producer for The Mighty Sparrow. One day, in a hurricane. Let’s go to “More
Cock.” By the way, one day, this entire album was done in one day. The Mighty
Sparrow went up to a piano and he did this [pats his left knee four times].
And the orchestra exploded into performance. I asked him about derivatives of
that rhythm, the merengue, baion, and so forth, and he told me that in
Trinidad, it’s like asking people what jazz means. Where did this come from,
this crooked beat that pushed the measure forward? And he said that in Curaçao
was the fable, was that, Curaçao, and a lot of people hold to it, that Peter
Stuyvesant, after he was governor general of Curaçao, came from the Caribbean,
came to be the governor general of New Amsterdam, he had a peg leg. One of his
knees was on a wooden stick. And the natives decided to popularize the
governor general’s gait in music. Here is “More Cock,” one day in a hurricane
in Miami. (music: The Mighty Sparrow – “More
Cock”) No literature. No literature at all. Same day. (music: The Mighty Sparrow -
“Maria” / applause) Mighty fine arranging by Earl, by the way, Earl Graham. So there’s a room that
sounded right away. The guy just went ‘boom-boom, boom-boom, bang!’ All during
Hurricane Edna, one day in 1971 in Miami. We were on independent generated
power. We got through a record in a day. And that’s from a record called Hot
And Sweet, by The
Mighty Sparrow. Reminding me about Earl Rodney, was the arranger of the piece,
about the power of arrangement in presenting a song. Now I just came up with
it. Let’s do something before we do this. Let’s go to “Spanish Moon.” This is
in the same year, 1971, with Little Feat, “Spanish Moon.” (music: Little Feat - “Spanish Moon”) BENJI B Is your approach to arranging brass kinda similar to the way that you approach
strings, or, I mean, is that a completely different beast? Van Dyke Parks No, no, no, that’s different. This is to a rhythm track. This arrangement is
to a rhythm track. I used the Tower Of Power, by the way. No, it’s different.
This is the genius of Lowell George, the late lament of my very good friend
Lowell. But all a part of that great American quiltwork we call Americana. I
learned so much from Lowell. I learned how to sit on a chord on this piece.
One of the greatest pieces I’ve ever heard is “Yes We Can,” by Allen
Toussaint, one of my very close friends. I produced his Southern Night
record, if you know that one. “Yes We Can.” One chord. Just to take a few
minutes and then we’ll be through with this show-and-tell. Here’s another
arrangement, a view of Americana. Let’s go to “The Parting Hand.” This is from
my new record, called Songs Cycle. (music: Van Dyke Parks – “The Parting Hand” / Parks makes some inaudible
commentary at different points in the song / applause) So that’s a song from 1886, a Sacred Harp Society hymnal, and that was my
reflections on that song of parting, that precious thing that I heard in the
mountains of North Carolina in my youth. So, always drawing on the Low Church,
the High Church, raping and running, doing all I can to reflect, to react to
these common, stolen goods we call Americana. That weaves throughout the
fabric of my work. Should we have some questions? BENJI B We’re almost there. We’re almost there. You want to do questions now? You’re
bored of me already. Van Dyke Parks Actually, I would prefer to listen to music. [laughter] You know, I think it was Zappa who said, “Talking about music is like dancing
about architecture.” BENJI B One thing I did want to get to before we open it out to questions is really
bringing it up to date. Because, of late, you’ve toured with Fleet Foxes, and
one of the more unusual collaborations that we should mention is you
collaborated with a young man named Skrillex. Tell us about how that came
about, and how a man of your musical stature approached a project like that. Van Dyke Parks Well, like I say, this is, once again, a lesson in caution against feeling
superior. I think that’s especially important if you really do have a great
musical ability. I think it invites arrogance. Because you know how damn good
you are. You’ve been told all your life. You’ve amazed people, maybe, with
signs of prodigy in your youth. Somehow you survived as a devoted musician.
You wonder if there’s ever going to be a real payoff. And I think in the
process you tend to overly self-protect, and that leads to feelings of, like,
auteur. Maybe like you might be too good for something that’s offered. That’s
just a common part of the human comedy. But in fact, I’ve spent a life of
taking that road that Yogi Berra said would lead to a fork, when I had to make
a decision, and the decision was based on two things. One is: am I too good to
do this? And the other is: am I up to doing this? And I’ve never been above
doing anything. If I’m not doing music, I do music. So when Skrillex called,
it was through an intermediary. A record company was... what do you call this?
A conference call. Some very protective vestigial organ called a record
executive was on the line, and here all of a sudden was Skrillex, and Skrillex
was calling from Belgium, it turned out. I said, “Where are you calling from,
Mr. Skrillex?” He said, “Skrillex!” “So where are you calling from?” He said,
“I’m in Belgium.” I said, “Well, what are you doing there?” He says, “I just
played a concert.” I said, “Oh really, for how many people?” He said, “Oh,
about 350,000 people.” I said, “Really? Did they come to see you?” He said,
“Yeah. They came to see me,” you know? I said, “Well, that’s very interesting.
Well, what do you do?” “I’m a DJ.” I said, “Well, that’s great.” I don’t know
what a DJ is, really. And I’m not proud of that. I said, “Well, that’s great.”
I said, “What can I do for you?” He said, “I want you to do an orchestration.”
I said, “OK. If you send it to me and I feel capable, I’ll do it.” He said,
“Oh great, Mr. Parks. We’ll destroy the world.” [laughter] “Great!” Put down the phone. What? “We’ll destroy the world.” We’re gonna
destroy the world with Skrillex. I go on one of these. I go on my laptop. I
YouTube, I get Skrillex. There he is in Belgium in front of 350,000 people.
Skrillex steps up to his laptop and he pours a beer on it. The crowd goes into
a state of erection. [laughter] They’re in ecstasy. And I think they’re on Ecstasy, too. [laughter] I mean, it’s madness. I don’t understand it. What am I doing here? But the mp3
came, and all of a sudden, it’s on a laptop, I have nothing else to do but a
wife asking me where her new shoes are. Or maybe the rent was late. I forget.
But there was no two ways about it. I was going to do this job. It confused me
a little when I ran into maybe 20 seconds of no chords. I thought maybe that
would create a dilemma, because maybe I would make the wrong decision. I was
at sea. And I must tell you that the results were, from the orchestra’s
standpoint, and that was quite an orchestra, we had to take out the partitions
at Capitol to expand the studio, A and B. They were all delighted. And as
amazed as I was, that we survived and landed on our feet. And why? The reason
we did this is because there were 350,000 unemployed European youth who were
desperate and hopeless and drugged and unable to find any transformation other
than through music. And I decided that it was a political obligation for me to
serve that man with all my heart. And that’s why I did that Skrillex session.
So I go into things with a totally unjudgmental attitude. I am slow to judge
and quick to praise. Anybody who makes music has got my vote. It beats bombs
in Baghdad. It beats munitions. It takes grit to be a musician. And it takes
the ability to serve people faithfully, and be slow to judge. And so all I can
tell ya is the check didn’t bounce and it had a comma in it. [laughter / applause] (music: Skrillex – “Skrillex Orchestral Suite Orchestral Suite” (performed by
Varien)) BENJI B That’s the bonus track on Skrillex’s Bangarang EP, as arranged by our guest
today. Before we open out to questions, you wanted to play something that
you’d brought in, right? From this CD. Van Dyke Parks Yeah. I think it’s good for people to know that it’s also a marvelous
opportunity to be involved with film scoring. And I do it on various levels.
And sometimes there’s no money. It might be with, like, a synthetic
arrangement, with dovetailed strings. Maybe I’ll get a violinist on top and a
cellist in the bottom to try to fool the discriminating listener into
believing that we have real music here. But this music is all orchestral. And
like I say, 800 copies were printed of The Super Chief. I hope that I can
get it released in the United States. But if that shouldn’t happen, I want you
to hear what my present tense is in movie scoring. Because I delight in it.
It’s a nice thing to know that the music is being used. It’s not being argued
down by some rock Nazi journalist. Who knows as much about a crucifixion as a
rabbit does about Easter Sunday. They leave you hanging there, folks. You
cannot make your case with critical acclaim or the defamatory remarks they
might make about your best effort. Just knowing you did your best often is
enough. So I did my best on these. Let’s look at “Two.” We played some of
“One” when these innocents came abroad. (music: Van Dyke Parks – “Go West Young Man”) On that last chord, I take an exception and divide the cellos into five
voices, on that sharp nine. Here is another, just a taste of this, to let you
know that I go on with this theme on track three. Same theme. (music: Van Dyke Parks – “To The Dining Car” / applause) I wish we had more time but thank you so much for indulging that. BENJI B There’s a whole CD of this stuff, so we’ll play it after the session and we
can leave it playing. But for now, it’s question time. Don’t be shy. I’m sure
there’s plenty of things. Wait for the mic. Yes, sir. Audience Member Hi. Thanks a lot for your lecture. Was very inspiring. And I felt very
identified with many things you said. I would like to compose music. I
normally make songs very often, and I don’t play them again. And many times,
people tell me that I should focus on something. But yeah, I like to make
music for, well, I’ve done cartoons and short films, but I’m kind of starting.
So I would like to know what you think about the importance of focusing on
some style, for example, and as you said, I don’t know, I feel very
comfortable at being nobody and trying to make something, maybe for the image,
or for the concept of other people. And I enjoy that process. So I want to
know about that. I also would like to know if you use any technique for making
your own script to organize the discords on your composition. Because, for
example, for me sometimes, I try to do not discord but, I don’t know, kind of
like tension chords, or intentions, throughout the song structure. And if you
can recommend any book about the experience of composing, or like a
continuation of your lecture through a book that I can read. Van Dyke Parks Are you talking about songwriting, or composition in general? Audience Member Composition in general. Van Dyke Parks Oh! You know, at the outset, it’s very interesting. Because it’s sad to say,
but don’t be disappointed. It’s sad to say the way cannot be told. The way
must be found. Damn it! [laughter] That’s the truth. Audience Member I believe you, but I’m sure you may have some tips. [laughter] Van Dyke Parks But I tell you, I haven’t found any instructive manual that prepares me for
music composition. The nice thing about having an opportunity to work on a
film, if you can find a colleague, a broke filmmaker who has no money to give
you, to put some music on his film, for example, what doing something with a
predestined through line. Oh, he has 20 minutes of music and no money. “OK,
I’ll do it.” And I do things like that. I do a lot of free stuff just to stay
engaged in music, and to try to learn. But it’s very helpful to find those
answers just by being thereand having the shock therapy of not being prepared
at all. What this has led me to is a contentment in one fact, and I know it
sounds like a cop-out, but I have found something which I think is an
indispensable lesson in music. You must know that you do not know. You must
know that. You can’t know nothing. When you enter the field. Because if you
have powers of prediction and so forth, I applaud that. Maybe you’re a
Presbyterian and know what tomorrow’s gonna bring. I don’t. I don’t know where
I’m going. You follow your madness, and you wobble through it. And I think
when people can recognize that, that’s what I think is the emotional content
of your work, is in not knowing. That you’re always painting yourself into a
corner. Sometimes you have to go back to that place where you went to a blind
alley, non-evolutionary musical event. And have to get back to where you were,
you know, 40 bars ago. But I think that it’s safe to say that you are as good
as your opportunities. And your opportunities can be improved if you engage
and don’t know, you find yourself ending up places you never could have
anticipated. And I think that’s the best, short, most productive, honest
answer. Audience Member Thanks. Van Dyke Parks OK. And I forgot to say, there was something I definitely should add, because
this was a highly biographical display. It’s a little embarrassing. We
should’ve just said, “The older I get, the better I was.” [laugher] Audience Member Hi. I would just like to say, collectively here, that we probably all feel the
same that I do right now, which is loving the human being that is you, and
thank you so much for existing, and being here, and speaking today. It’s been
indescribable. But I would like for you to elaborate a bit on what you said
about criticism within the music industry, and your journey dealing with that,
because what you said was quite profound, but very short. Van Dyke Parks Well, you know, a lot of people don’t pay any attention to the static in the
bat cave, you know? And, of course, that’s what happens when you work and it
receives any public regard. Interesting! One of my favorite quotations is
attributable to Thomas Jefferson, who said, “If you reveal your depths, men
will ford your shallows.” You take that risk in music. You are stripped and
bleeding. You’re nude in front of the vulgar public gaze. If you reveal your
depths, they will ford your shallows. I think that, and also Sally Hemmings,
was probably the reason that Thomas Jefferson was, as they said, loathe to
unveil his true affections to the vulgar public gaze. But if you have
integrity, you do reveal yourself in your work. You reveal yourself
wholeheartedly. And better without hesitation. You know, it just comes with
the dinner. You have to take these positive and negative impulses, the static
in this bat cave of bloggery, which we now inhabit. Everybody’s got an
opinion. You know, I used to think a lot of democracy. Then I ran into airport
security on my way here. I don’t know. I somehow think it would’ve been better
to be a royal, before oil. But I find that it’s a distraction to consider what
people think of your work. But it’s inevitable. So let’s just face it. Let’s
look at the good, the bad, and the ugly. And let’s be informed by it all. When
I did my first record, some reviewer had the cheek to say that I had created
the Edsel of pop music. You know, if I had an Edsel today, I’d be a very
wealthy man. And at that time, that really got under my skin. It’s funny how
insults are so indelible. And faint praise is forgettable. But you have to go
ahead, you see. If this is what you were talking about. You have to accept
criticism. And, as a matter of fact, I think you can learn so much from it.
And I try to. And I don’t seek the company of people who necessarily agree
with me. I would rather have the detergent effect of testing my opinions with
people who are entirely at odds with me. I don’t feel like I’m preaching to a
choir here. I invite skepticism, and I think you all should, in your work. And
let it strengthen you, in your resolve. OK? Because courage is contagious, and
I wanna tell you something: I’m one tough old bird. Hasn’t killed me yet. Audience Member Thank you. Van Dyke Parks This is a very, very good thing. I would be lying to tell you this is Red
Bull [raising his glass]. But I’ve had some other thoughts about this. The
product of this endeavor. My son told me. I said, “What is Red Bull?” I mean,
I knew it was an energy, a field of energy. But I said to my son, my son is 30
-years-old, he’s a journalist, he’s also in an imploded industry. I said,
“What is Red Bull?” He said, “Well, Dad, look at it like this. They represent
the new patronage of music.” I said, “Really? That’s great.” He said, “In the
collapse of the record business, this is a fact.” So, in a field of forfeit,
this is win/win. Because I think the most significant thing that has happened
in my witness to music is that we’ve lost patronage. It’s not like the age of
Mozart, or the Medicis in Florence. We don’t have this. Nobody is helping us,
the way we want help. I mean, you’ve received some attention and some support
here, but it’s safe to say that there is no patronage in the arts. This, after
the presidency of George W. Bush, when somebody asked the man in the Oval
Office, they said, “Mr. President, what kind of music do you like?” He said,
“Music? I don’t like it.” He wasn’t kidding. And it shows now in the malaise
of American funding. They have ripped out the umbilicus between the arts and a
corporatized support, that is, without obligation. They’ve ripped that
umbilicus from what could really be a gestation of some great talent. I’m sure
the majority of you feel under-funded, and like you have opportunities that
you deserve that just aren’t appearing. And you haven’t had the good fortune
that I have had. But I guarantee perseverance will further. And we must find a
way out of this dilemma that is this age of no patronage of the arts. We must
find our way clear of this. [applause]

Seth Troxler
Seth Troxler has created some of today’s finest and most intuitive dance cuts, including releases on Spectral, Items & Things, as Thrill Cosby on Circus Company, as Young Seth on FXHE, and many others. Through a preternatural understanding of rave, Seth conjures up mixes with Visionquest, his party/production group turned label alongside partners Ryan Crosson, Shaun Reeves, and Lee Curtiss.
In his 2013 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Troxler discussed the importance of personal branding and humility, Visionquest, and more.
Hosted by Todd L. Burns Welcome to today’s first lecture. A nice bit of synergy in a way, I suppose, because we started the Academy with Richie Hawtin and today I’m joined by a guy who once said, “He’s my favorite DJ ever,” Seth Troxler. Seth Troxler Yes, that’s me. Hello. How you guys doing? [applause] Seth Troxler Full circle. Todd L. Burns The circle is completed. Seth Troxler Like a dark… What’s the Star Wars…? Todd L. Burns I don’t have… Seth Troxler Lost for words. Todd L. Burns Good start, good start. [laughter] You just came in from Detroit. Seth Troxler Yeah, I just came in from Detroit. Todd L. Burns You were at the Movement festival. Seth Troxler We were at the Movement festival. Todd L. Burns And you throw a party every Movement festival, a party not at the festival proper but outside, called Need I Say More? Seth Troxler Yeah, I’m actually originally from Detroit. I live now in Europe, just kind of on aeroplanes and in hotels, but for years before I started my career – if you guys don’t know me, my name is Seth Troxler. I’m a DJ, I have a record label named Visionquest. I also kind of make records on occasion, but recently have been more known for voiceover work, kind of like being an actor that was once great and now you’re only Garfield. So, I do that, but years ago when I was living in Detroit Ryan Crosson and some other partners of mine who had this label Visionquest, we were promoters. And it’s kind of funny, this guy back here [points to back of audience], Will Calcutt, used to go out and there was kind of local scene stuff and we had this party that another person here [points to audience], Wendy, little did she know that some of the people here that work here, actually, used to be really fun [laughs]. We threw this party outside every Monday at this club called the – not a club, it’s a veteran’s bar… Todd L. Burns It’s definitely not a club. Seth Troxler It’s a really kitschy veteran’s bar called The Old Miami, kind of like the closing Monday of the festival, and we had Mr Gerd Janson, who is one of the main guys here, was DJing with Ben UFO and we also had Tale Of Us and Soul Clap, so it was a great weekend. The first time it rained but [hiccups] – excuse me, I’ve had a little too much Red Bull. That berry stuff, really, it’s like pancakes in your mouth. [laughter] Caffeinated pancakes. [laughs] So, yeah, it was a great weekend, I mean it was amazing. It was amazing to see all the people out, and just to see the crowd at the DEMF [Detroit Electronic Music Festival] this year had become a lot more mature. It was brilliant. It seems like there’s been a real divergence, and the people who are going to real niche festivals that are musically curated to that… Or I mean, a couple of weeks ago I was in New York playing at EDC [Electronic Daisy Carnival] and the crowds were so completely different. And at one stage at that point here, playing on the CNTRL stage with Richie Hawtin, we were kind of exposing people to that stuff [gestures], from the other side, and then [laughs] we’re in Detroit. It’s like everyone was, you know, just like us. Todd L. Burns It must be quite interesting to see electronic music – some electronic music – blowing up, in a way, because when you were growing up in Detroit – you’d moved there from Kalamazoo early on – that was totally a niche thing. Seth Troxler Yeah, definitely. Maybe a lot of participants here – I don’t know where all you guys are from – but growing up in Detroit, which has this very rich history, we actually had a very small musical scene. It was kind of funny, at the time when I was growing up, I was in high school, I was playing music, I was working at this record store called Melodies and Memories. Terrence Parker and Theo Parrish
used to work there. It’s a fantastic, fantastic music store. And funnily enough
this guy I said earlier, Will [Calcutt], he was in college with Matthew Dear, and Matthew Dear went to the same school as me, and we’re this kind of ending generation of Detroit. Magda, Richie Hawtin, these guys had just started coming back. Magda was still in Detroit before she moved to New York and then to Berlin. But overall the entire scene was about 250 people, and this is Detroit, like classic Detroit. All of the scene that was combined was some college kids and
some old DJs, and then the whole time, coming up at that time, electronic music was in a bit of a lull, also being there you had no view of the outside world. You know, you thought, “OK, we collect records, we’re all really into this music, but there’s nothing outside of just being a local DJ and maybe playing before some out-of-town headliners.” Until at some point, I was a junior in high school, I think… Todd L. Burns Sorry, but you’re a junior in high school and you’re thinking, “Boy, we’ll never get to Europe.” You were quite young. Seth Troxler Yeah, I was quite young, but also it wasn’t until later that I even realized that. So many people in that city are in that mentality, and also with electronic music I didn’t realize how big the European market was, because we were never exposed to that. If you’re coming from a small place and – like our friend here is from Istanbul, or let’s say you’re coming from somewhere in Venezuela – and things there may seem very local and small. But one of the biggest things you have to start thinking and looking at is the global community that your genre of music may sit inside. It wasn’t until I had gone to Sónar – which funnily enough I’m playing at, I’m closing this year – again full circle – but I went to Sónar with Matt Dear and Will back here, funny enough, and I’m like 17, 18. I’m outside, I’m lost, I’m going to India with my family and just had the chance to stop off there. This guy I know, who actually went to the same high school as me, his wife’s little sister’s locker’s next to mine, I just know him from local bars or coming to play with them at this night they did in school, to being on a stage and there’s 10,000 people and he’s playing after Richie Hawtin or Ricardo Villalobos. It wasn’t until then that my mind was like, “Boom! Whoa, this is real. This can be real.” And I mean, everyone here who’s been accepted into this program, I hope this experience is putting that in your mind, that this… This can be real. You’ve already taken those steps. I know when I was younger, also around the same time, I really wanted to come to this programme. I tried to sign up, I did the paperwork, but I was too young. Then I was old enough and then it came to America and then I wasn’t old enough again, and then I started university and I was doing parties and making music and just got on with it and gave up on the dream. And kinda… Todd L. Burns You gave up on this dream. Seth Troxler On this dream. [laughs] It was like, whatever, I’m just going to do it myself and persevere to do everything. I mean, that’s one thing about this career – [addressing audience] I’m sorry I’m having such a long-winded speech, but some of this stuff is a bit important and I’m just trying to make you guys realize that things are possible. And one thing that is really important for everyone to know: if you want this career and if you want this to be your life, you have to give up almost everything for it to be your life. It has to be an absolute. There is no half-stepping, like, “Oh, I’m going to have this little side-job now and be comfortable with that,” or trying to keep certain parts of your normality in life. To keep that dream or to really excel in it, you have to go full, 100 million % or else you won’t make it. There is no time for half-stepping. And even later in life, let’s say, once you start to become a little bit more successful, a D-list celebrity like myself, [laughs] once you start to get to this point where I’m out on the road maybe five, six days a week, and giving up some of your old, past life… I mean, it’s good to know exactly what’s in store, or what can possibly be in store for you. One of my good friends, Benoit & Sergio, this guy Ben, this kind of group, they’re on my label and also on DFA [Records], he used to be a professor at John Hopkins and now he goes and sings pop songs at raves. [laughs] He once told me, “You know, one of the funniest things is when your dreams come true at some point it can become your greatest nightmare.” You know, you change life. Your dream becomes something new, something that you’d never imagined. That’s something that you guys should really think about, what life do you want to live? What is the goal of being invested in this? And really get to the brass tacks of it, not the fame, not money or anything. That stuff doesn’t really happen anyway. I mean, you get some cash here and there, you can survive, but what’s your real goal, the real point of doing what you’re doing? And really think about that, a lot. Todd L. Burns Was there a moment at which you consciously made that decision, or was it just, “I’m working in a record store, here’s the next step, we’re throwing parties”? Seth Troxler No, we did make that very conscious decision. I was just finishing university and Visionquest, that’s the record label I have, there are four of us – my friends Ryan Crosson, Shaun Reeves and Lee Curtiss. Shaun had already moved to Europe, he was the first one to go, and then Ryan was working for his father. They had a company that they bought and sold used machinery, he used to drive around America and buy industrial machinery from companies. And Lee was a used car salesman, and I was in university studying graphic design. At some point we had been going over to Berlin every summer for years and playing over there and bringing back ideas and doing things. Then at once point we said, “You know what? Let’s do it. F— it, let’s drop everything.” So we planned that next summer we were going to move, so we got up all of our stuff and we were like, “What’s the worst that can happen? We move back to Detroit.” So we moved to Berlin, as you did at that time and I met you [gestures to Todd] there, and we were just some young kids with a dream, trying to make it happen, you know, and just kind of jumped in. I mean time in Berlin then was a lot different. This is like 2006, 2007. I think 2007 was the year we first came over… Yeah because I’ve been here almost seven years, I’ve been living in Europe for about seven years. That was all happening and we just dove in. Lee, he lasted a couple of months, went back. It was kind of crazy, we were living with our friend Shaun. At that time Gadi Mizrahi was there that summer, who’s Wolf + Lamb. Lee, Ryan and I sleeping on a futon together in Shaun’s living room. [mimes being crowded] There’s some point when you’re broke and your best friend wakes up with his arm around you a couple too many times and you’re just like [groans], you’re eating Döners every day, but we had a dream, you know? It was like, “This is what I have to do until I can make it to get something that’s working.” Luckily we didn’t have to do that for too long, but it was a couple of months trying to find a place and get some money together to do something and make it happen, but that’s the kind of thing you have to go through, to really get there, to get to the point, you know? Todd L. Burns I want to go back a little bit to Detroit, your time there. You said you were working in a record store at a very early age. How did you… Why was that the first job that you wanted? Seth Troxler Well, actually it’s kind of funny how I got the job. I was just there the other day with Ben UFO and I took him into the old record store and it’s actually one of the greatest record stores in America. We had the biggest 45 collection. I was just a kid who was coming in, I was a dork. I didn’t get any social skills until later in life, so I was really introverted, a record kid. My parents were into house music, so I’ve been listening to dance music since I was about eight. My dad had a radio show when I was younger. So, I was this kid, I would come in every weekend with my little cash, whatever I could scrape up, and buy records every single week. That’s all I thought about, and the Internet on message boards… Todd L. Burns What kind of records? Seth Troxler At the time it was kind of the same music I play now, which is really funny, and actually deeper house. My first record was on Omar S’s label FXHE, under the name Young Seth, so I was into really deep house. After going to raves in Detroit at that time and the people I was involved with, with Magda and Matt Dear and these other people, getting more into the minimal scene, there was a party at the time called Untitled – that was really the last decadent period in underground Detroit dance music. That kind of brought me more into minimalism and Perlon – this record label of Zip, Dimbiman and also famed for some of the
earlier Ricardo Villalobos releases – was just happening, in its infancy. But at the time I was just going to this record store every weekend. The guy Gary, my old boss, was telling Ben and I, “Yeah, it’s really funny. This guy would come in all the time with his godfather and he’d buy these records.” And just by my taste alone and the fact that they had lost a techno buyer and I was this geek, he was like, “So, do you want to work here? You’re really nice.” He said I was a nice kid who spent money, I had good taste, so for him it was perfect. I got this job working three days a week. I’d work Thursday when the records came in and then on the weekends, just selling records to anyone of any genre. I would listen to every record that came in and try to listen to every record in the shop when I was sitting around, just so I could know. Even though you may not like some music or other music, you still know if it’s good or bad within that genre. I hate going to a record store and you go in and, people, like… You know you get this arrogant record store guy? It’s kind of funny, like at Hard Wax, which is funny enough – I’ve been going to Hard Wax for years, which is this old, famed record store in Berlin, and the guys know me there. No matter what – they know what I play – no matter what, they pull me this stuff and you’re like, “Eh, why did you just spend all that time pulling these records that you know I will not buy?” You should go to a store and there should be some type of connection, where someone just picks you records that are good for you and are good for whatever you’re saying. But I’m kind of diverging into something else. Todd L. Burns You mentioned Perlon and obviously you were listening to all the records, but I feel like that record label you’ve talked about before is particularly important to you, in a way. Seth Troxler It’s been the hugest influence, I think, on my musical direction and life. I don’t know if anyone here knows the label. It seems like there are a lot of different people here from different backgrounds, but I find that as far as electronic music goes, or abstract electronic music, it’s almost the Blue Note of our time. They did a lot of concepts and released a lot of music that was so ahead of its time – and still is – using micro-sampling, using old dub influences, bridging some gaps between what is minimalism and house, and also experimental music. And at that time, especially when they were starting, the ideas were so new. And you know, when you’re young, these new ideas are happening, it’s really like, “Wow, I can’t believe this is true.” And also coming from Detroit, having some kind of faceless – I mean, again, not knowing
about the DJ culture and everything that’s going on that made people big – but just having these faceless German labels when you’re like 16 and everyone’s listening to hip-hop and you’re into these weird German people who you don’t know. It’s kist like, “This is incredible.” I remember there’s this record cover on Playhouse for one of my favorite songs ever, “Warriors” by this guy LoSoul. “Where do I belong” was the lyrics, and it had all these pictures from this old, famous club, Robert Johnson, with him and Ata and all these people like Roman Flügel and stuff. I just remember looking every day on my bed at these pictures and these people and coming up with these huge fantasies of what was actually happening. It was a small, 300-person club and it was them and their friends, but to me it was this huge idea, it was this huge dream. You know, “Oh, these guys in Frankfurt, they’re so crazy and German.” [laughs] Todd L. Burns It’s amazing because I think for a lot of people overseas, the perception about Detroit was the same way. Seth Troxler Exactly. It’s funny you say that, because when I was bringing Gerd over the other weekend or Ben, for them, just to be in Detroit was this big, wow, it was this epiphany, because for their whole lives they had always looked up to the musicianship of the city, whether it be in techno or hip-hop or whatever. There’s a lot of Dilla fans all over, and the record store I used to work at was the same record store House Shoes, who was one of the main DJs who represented that music from Detroit, worked at forever. They were like, “I can’t believe all this stuff happened here.” For us, growing up in that situation, you don’t really realize until you’re gone how much of an effect it has on you or it’s had on the world, much like them in Europe. Like, Gerd’s from Frankfurt – he’s like, yeah whatever, Robert Johnson. He’s the main resident. But for me… Actually, one of the first gigs I played in Europe, I was 18, I went with Omar S and played at Robert Johnson and Panorama Bar for him. Todd L. Burns Did it live up to the fantasies? Seth Troxler Yeah, it was kind of funny. I was really nervous and I had dreads and Omar gave me this really big T-shirt. I wear kind of not big T-shirts and I had this over-large T-shirt I ended up giving to one of his friends, like three times my size. But it’s funny how all that works out. Sometimes as well, let’s say if you’re in the middle of a movement or something happening – let’s say with you and your friends, right now you may not realize it, but maybe a few people in this room have a connection today where in 30 years, it’s like Brian Eno meeting someone else. It’s like that was the spark, that was the period, that’s when it happened. That’s stuff that you have to keep in your mind, and kind of think in the long term as well. You don’t realize it until later, but it’s kind of funny how all these things, all these experiences that you’re having now, will actually have a huge effect later, in your life. Todd L. Burns You went on tour with Omar, who you said put out your first record. Did you meet him at the record store? Seth Troxler I met him at the record store, it’s kind of funny. I’ve just gone back to playing records only, and there’s something really important about, I think, the communication that happens at a record store, and record stores being cultural places. That’s something you don’t get online buying records, being at the store, talking to people who come into the store, talking to the store clerk, making connections to other people who are into music at the store. I met Ryan Crosson, my partner who’s been my number one, we’ve done everything together, businesses, everything, and he was the first customer in the record store the first day I worked. There’s these small coincidences, there’ll be a lot of coincidences in your lives that are actually a lot more than coincidences – I think in many ways they’re fate – that you shouldn’t overlook. A lot of small meetings that become quite large down the line. It’s funny, at the time it’s like, “OK, I met this guy,” but life puts the right points in front of you and it’s your… It’s up to you to grab those moments and grab those connections and those meetings. Those are the meetings that take you on later on life, so be open to everything. When you’re meeting people, it could be a guy you may be sitting next to and just say hello to, maybe your future partner or maybe the love of your life or whatever. Everything is intertwined in a way and it’s something you have to really realize early. And then when it happens, and the more you start to realize these things, the more when things happen you’re like, “You know what? I will call you back.” Or, “Thanks for this card, let’s have a beer or something,” being polite and nice. Be nice to everyone. Huge point. Don’t be a dick. [laughter] Straight up, because a lot of music is almost like a country club. Word gets out fast if someone’s an asshole, and it’s like, “Yeah, that guy’s cool but like, doneskis – we ain’t featuring him no more.” It’s straight up like that, if someone’s got really arrogant or anything. It’s kind of funny with arrogance or whatever. People who are just starting to do things, let’s say, in music – your first little single comes out, you get a nice review, cats be like, aw yeah, and then start acting funny. It’s like, the more success you get, the more you realize it doesn’t matter, just be normal. At some point you just want to go back to being normal. That’s kind of one thing with our party we do in Detroit. It’s the one time a year where I get to throw a party, I work the door and I’m just a normal guy again. You got to keep as long as you can being an artist or being a producer or whatever, just to be kind to people, be open for things. And don’t bust people’s balls for nothing or kind of position yourself in different ways, because everyone really is equal, no matter how great of an artist you are. And you find that people who are the best artists and the biggest artists are also the most humble, so keep that to yourself, that’s a good one. That helps a lot. [laughs] Todd L. Burns Why don’t we play a record really quick. This is not your first one, but early on. Let’s play a snippet of it. (music: Seth Troxler –
“Aphrika”) Seth Troxler This is a record that was out on a label here. This is a label here from Wolf + Lamb. This was my third record, I think?
A tribute to my grandma. Later on some Moog stuff comes in. It’s kind of funny, there’s a guy back here, a Venezuelan kid back here, [points into audience] we were talking earlier. I think a lot of music that’s for mixing it’s kind of hard to judge that stuff where you’ve just got a beat, but progression of your tracks is huge. I mean, I have a record label – I’m actually about to have three record labels and we’re signing tracks. Musical progression and also simplicity of a song is something that you start to recognize a lot more and more. Don’t throw loads of stuff in your tracks just to throw loads of stuff in your tracks, tricks and that. As long as it flows and works, that’s are the tracks that normally sell the best and also become the best songs in your own discography. Todd L. Burns That particular track, there’s this one moment in there that’s like a glitch, almost. Seth Troxler Yeah, yeah. Todd L. Burns I was really interested in why you left that in. Seth Troxler I think mistakes are cool, whether you’re DJing or whatever. Perfection – no one really likes perfection in any part of life I find, whether you meet someone and they’ve got funny teeth, you’re like, “Oh, that’s cute, what’s up?” [laughs] That search for perfection is kind of pointless. I think in music as well, if things are over-produced it just doesn’t sound human. You miss that... That realness, you know? That’s always been a difference between my production style and my best friend Ryan. He tools and tools over stuff forever and at some point you lose some of the essence, rather than just being like, “Yo, that’s good. F--- it, let’s roll.” I think that’s kind of cool about music at times, you can just have a tune. Don’t be sloppy, but a little sloppiness, a little mess-up or off rhythm here or there is kind of what keeps things original in a way. I think when you’re listening to music or hearing music – and right now with the digital age a lot of people are going back to older production techniques that are more
human, and perfection’s a bit over. Perfection was last season. I like polka dots now. [laughter] Todd L. Burns Your record label Visionquest that you run with Ryan, Shaun and Lee – one of the things about it is that you pay a lot of attention to the art and the... The branding of it, I suppose, is the maybe dirty word for it. Seth Troxler [violently coughs] Excuse me. I’m dying! It’s kind of funny that you say art and branding, because I pay extreme attention to detail. One thing that I wanted to talk to you guys about, is some realness that goes along with being polite, is being extremely mindful of your personal brand. Who you are and building a personal brand, or just an image of who you are as an artist or as a studio producer. Well, mainly an artist, behind the scenes you don’t really need to build that personal brand. Todd L. Burns How do you do that without appearing as though you’re building a personal brand? Seth Troxler It’s kind of funny, that’s what I’ve made a career out of in a way. But it’s just being mindful of how everything is, how everything looks, especially with the digital age today and Facebook, MySpace, all this stuff. It’s about putting out something where people can look at you, can look to your music or can kind of date back, but it’s always there. It will always be in public forever now with the Internet, it’s forever stamped. Earlier you kind of build an image for yourself, whether it’s really tongue in cheek, whether it’s just yourself, or just what people know you for, the more that your fanbase becomes familiar with that... For me, in many ways, it’s a way to distance yourself from your real self and your artistry, because at times the more you get in, it’s hard for those two things to come together. Todd L. Burns So would you say Seth Troxler, the artist, is much different than Seth Troxler, the person? Seth Troxler It’s not so much different, that’s how you keep it real, but also it is a bit played up. At the end of the day it’s entertainment, so when you’re creating these images for these people you have to be a bit more outgoing. No one really wants a super-introverted, dark, “I wear my jacket at night with my mother”-type vibes. I was just trying to come up with something really Norman Bates, I don’t know. We were talking about that earlier. Todd L. Burns It is interesting. Like, Richie Hawtin, Plastikman, that’s a dark, introverted character. Seth Troxler Yeah, but also with Rich, one thing about that character is, I don’t know if you guys know who Richie Hawtin is, but there’s few people in this industry who are on top of every single point of everything. It’s that meticulous nature of what you’re trying to create. Who is the character or the general art concept? Being conceptual is everything. That’s more the point with personal brand-building. I mean, if you look at labels like Ghostly or M-nus, there’s a huge, deep concept behind that. Even Visionquest, there’s a concept behind things, and I think our label would have been even bigger if we had more precise with the art direction. The earlier you can lock into that art direction, either your artist or your label, and create a clear, precise vision of what that is, then I think the more success you’ll have in either field. Just being precise and being on top and involved with every single decision like, “Boom, no, it’s like this.” Create a vision, not just, I’m making music because it’s cool. If you’re going to go for it, go for it. One person who’s really great, and this is an example, but Lady Gaga, she is so precise. I know some people who know her and work with her. Or Daft Punk – Daft Punk’s great because they’re so big right now – they’re so precise behind every decision that they’ve made. The music’s always been okay, but the success kind of breaks down to their personal brand-building and their personal image. At some point they were like, “We’re going to ditch just being two geeky French guys, put on these masks and create a whole fantasy.” Because in some ways my own personal success has been behind the fantasy that people believe that I may be. I can be a loose guy but I’m also a very organised, precise person. By people in some ways living out their own fantasies through your music or through your person, as a character, or through your label’s vision, and then being able to identify their own selves through that brand... I liked, when I was a kid, let’s say Ghostly, Spectral. They’ve done an amazing job with linking alternative, young art student kids or college kids to their brand. It’s like you identify yourself – I listen to this music because it’s the kind of person I want to be. The kind of clothes that I wear, from every single point down. That’s really important, that’s how the world works and this is a truth. With artists, let’s say this kid right here, he kind of looks like someone who likes minimal techno or industrial. [laughter] Todd L. Burns You need to hear his music. Seth Troxler But at the same time, if you look at people like, let’s go back to Richie Hawtin, a lot of the people who go with that brand, with that music, they had created a perfect imagery where everyone going to those parties felt like they were inclusive into that idea, into that style of living, and that’s important. Todd L. Burns One of the things you’ve tried to do, kind of in the style of Rich’s lineage of throwing parties and building spaces, is these Visionquest parties. One of the biggest ones you did was at DC10 last year in Ibiza. Can you talk about what you did to the space and why it was so important to you to transform it? Seth Troxler So, right now I’m doing a project called Visionquest 13. Visionquest is the label that we have, and we’re doing 13 events. Coming into this, we were thinking, or I was thinking, I was like, “OK, what hasn’t changed in our music or events?” Basically, dance music events have been in the same space or the same format for 30 years. Nothing’s really changed, you’re in a dark club. Then I was like, “OK, musically things have changed, but I’m not a crazy musical innovator.” I know in my heart I’m not going to make the best album ever that’s going to change the world, that’s just not going to happen. So it’s like, “How else can we produce change?” So we thought, OK... The best idea that I came up with, the environment of clubbing, club culture hasn’t changed. I thought back on experiences I had in my life and I was like, “Well, the experiences that did affect me the most in my life, that changed my life really, were the experiences where both the environment was almost a one-off.” When the environment had changed for that one specific time, only that once could you experience it. Also there some things going on with immersive theatre in London, like You Me Bum Bum Train, or there’s a group here, Sleep No More, where you go to these warehouses and you’re kind of in this pop-up environment space. So we were like, “OK, let’s make pop-up environments.” A one-off event where you can go into this entire living environment, experience these things and then only for that one night would they be there. So, DC10 for a decade it’s always just been this outside and two inside spaces and that’s it. Sometimes they put a stage up, but it’s never actually changed, it’s always exactly the same. To add effect we made the whole outside almost carnival-y. There was these teepees everywhere you could go into, huge balloons, oil lamps, a real spectacle. Then you go inside and it was like this Twin Peaks-type situation, red curtains everywhere, draping. Then you went into the back room – that’s normally the huge terrace – and it was like this maze that you had to go through and there were these boxes where you could relax in, that were made of triangles. There’s huge fog everywhere and velvet and stuff. You could go do all these things. There’s a telephone in a corner with a light on it, very Lynchian, that you could pick up and then on the other line there’s another phone outside in the garden that had other people on it. Trying to create experiences, you know? At the back of that we were like, “Wow, we should do some more of these.” So then this year we took 13 gigs around the world and found spaces that were like that. We tried to do one Fabric and we did one at Warehouse Project, a big party in Manchester the other week, and tried to take spaces right now that were very normal. People had been going to Warehouse Project, it’s been open for how many years, no one’s ever changed it. You can make a huge impact by doing small things. Let’s say if you’re a promoter – this is also another huge point if you’re making music or trying to start something, is getting involved in your local scene. Like my man here from Turkey throwing events, making your own culture happen. That’s a big way how we became successful. Creating our own... You know, no one’s going to give it to you. There’s enough cake for everybody but you got to go get your cake. You got to get that cake on your own. You’re not going to horde the cake. You got to be like, “Yo, I’m going to bake my own cake and then when I want to give somebody else some cake, they can have some cake. It’s my cake.” But you made that cake, you made that piece of the pie for yourself, you created that niche. You know? Creating that niche is something that’s always yours, that’s something that can be really strong, so that’s something we’re trying to capitalize on. I’m going to have to cut somebody if they come in here steal my ideas, but creating something new, and we want to start creating immersive-environment events because it’s something that’s not really happening yet. Being from marketing, one of the biggest things is the ‘law of first’. If you’re the first person to do something... Coca Cola was the first cola company, forever they’ll be number one because they were the first. If you look at Kellogg’s for cereal, forever
number one. It doesn’t work like this in all industries, but in most. Like Red Bull, first energy drink, leaps and bounds ahead of every competition. If you can come into something and be the first to do that and really push out like, “Yo, boom, I hit first,” as Kendrick Lamar or whatever that dude was saying. People are like, “That dude, you did hit it first,” and people remember that. So, that’s an important thing to do, whether it’s throwing events, making
music, coming up with ideas first and then really putting down your plot. That’s your personal brand, this is our brand idea, this is what we stand for. It’s important. Todd L. Burns Speaking of first, you were voted the number one DJ by the Resident Advisor readers last year. How have things changed since then? Seth Troxler It’s kind of funny. This is back to the thing, your biggest dream may become your worst nightmare. Success is a funny thing. It’s something that you strive and strive for and then once you have it, it becomes a burden more than anything else. So, it’s been cool, but it’s also been a bit funny. The two previous years I was number three then number two, then number one. Before that, when you’re number three and number two, you can just do your thing and people come to your parties and you’re cool. As soon as you become number one people start gunning for you. Todd L. Burns Who’s gunning for you? [laughs] Seth Troxler I don’t know, but it just seems different. It’s just weird. Also people start going to your events or your parties knowing nothing really about you, just the fact you’re quote-unquote number-one, and that’s uncomfortable. That’s the wrong side of the hype-train that you want to be on. If you can live in this world that’s kind of in between, doing your thing and whatever, it’s cool. It’s also depending on what you want to go for. I mean, Jamie Jones and I – I don’t know if you guys know this, he’s another electronic music artist – actually, last year he was number one and I was number two – but we were also on the same agency and doing a lot of stuff together. We played together all the time. After that year I broke off to leave to William Morris, a different booking agency, and he stayed with his crew. And also he’s trying to go down a bit of a pop route, where I’ve turned ‘round like, “Well, I’m going to go back underground,” you know, it’s just more comfortable for me. It’s making that choice of where you want to be and what you want to do, if you want to be an underground artist or an overground artist. He’s always looked at this level of success and he’s more comfortable with it, where for me it’s uncomfortable. That’s a big point, finding what you want to do with this whole thing, where you want to go. Like, I know at 15 I had a point in my mind, almost this point, it’s almost like, that’s where I’m going to go by this age. Define what you’re going to do. Be like, for real, this is it, I am going to eat, live, die, do whatever I can to get there – besides being a dick. Whatever I can do, I’m going to get there by all means possible, because that’s why I’m here to do this. This is what I’ve put my life into and you give everything for to reach that level and that’s it. That’s kind of what’s up. Todd L. Burns You said you wanted to go underground in general terms, but specifically, what do you mean by that? Seth Troxler By going back underground. I mean, at some point it was kind of funny trying to reach number one or whatever. Todd L. Burns Was that a goal, a specific goal? Seth Troxler At some point it did become a goal, because I did number three, number two and I was just like... Actually, last year before I got to number one I was like, “Maybe we could try to do something to stay at number two,” because I didn’t want the pressure. I was like, “How can we lose but just by a bit?” [laughs] But in the back of your mind it becomes a thing. There’s something about being an artist, this kind of narcissism, which kinds of feeds you, but you can’t let out, which is kind of funny. It’s being completely comfortable with being uncomfortable. I heard this great thing from Deepak Chopra but I forgot the quote, but he was saying something about really talented people. He was like, “They are comfortable with knowing that they are uncomfortable or uneasy around people.” It’s a weird thing but there is definitely this tic I find with successful people that’s different, there’s a drive. All the people I know in any type of business that are really successful have this same kind of, not narcissism, but the same thing that makes it work. It gives them this extra drive level; believing in yourself a lot, but not believing in yourself, which makes no sense but it really does work. It’s like – oh god, this is another great quote. It’s about New Order. I read in NME, they had this big piece on them and they were saying, at the time when New Order was really happening, journalists had never met somebody who was so shy, yet so confident. That’s pretty huge, being in the back but knowing, boom, it’s happening. This is legit. But not being outspoken like, “Yo, I’m the best!” That’s not cool. But being in your mind humble and kind of reserved, like many of the artists you’ve seen here have all been really cool. I know Kieran, Four Tet’s been in here and Mat Jonson and they’re all really humble, nice guys but still forever have known they’re some of the best in the industry. Todd L. Burns Why don’t we play another track, because I want to use it as a jumping off point to talk about partying. (music: The Royal We – “Party Guilt”) There’s a voice-over on that track, obviously. Is that you? Seth Troxler Yeah, it’s me, it’s kind of funny. Todd L. Burns You’re talking about, every time someone wants something, or every time you
come to me you want something. Seth Troxler I’m talking about kind of scene shit, or this party bullsh--, I guess. [laughs] Todd L. Burns The track is called “Party Guilt”. Seth Troxler Which sometimes you get as well if you go out too long. You feel like, “Why did I do this? What am I doing with my life?” That is something that may come to all of you as well, this big doubt phase. Like, “What am I doing with my life?” – which you have to overcome, I guess. Todd L. Burns Have you overcome it? Seth Troxler No, you never really quite do, which is funny enough. I mean, I’m doing well and everything but even now there’s many times – my tour manager over here can attest to that – where I’m like, after a gig, it may be a huge show but I wasn’t really into the crowd or the people and stuff and you’re kind of in this thing. Like I said, I’m trying to go back underground. The other weekend when I played at EDC and I’m playing for these kids and stuff, I was like, “What am I doing with my life? Why am I here?” There’s like 3000 people in front of you but you’re still, “I’m never satisfied.” This track I was talking about, at that time I was living in Berlin. I liked to go to parties, I liked to hang out and have a good time, but there’s a thing within scenes where you meet scene people – every scene is like that – and they just start asking you for things, or they just talk about parties or talk about everything else. It’s important to have – this more than anything – it’s important to have a real life, or try to keep a real life. Even though I was saying dedicate everything in your life to this, it’s also pretty good to have a little... Todd L. Burns So how do you get that balance? Seth Troxler I don’t know, I’m trying to figure that out, really. Stick with some of your crew, stick with some of your friends. All the people around me have been around me for over a decade, basically. All my friends, even my girlfriend, I’ve known for like seven, eight years. The more you can keep of your old life... It’s a funny thing, because you have
to at some points ditch your life to become successful, but there’s also some points you want to keep from that to keep you grounded. So, it’s up to everyone but it’s hard living your dream and being a musician, especially being a travelling musician, is something that if you want to do it, it’s really extremely difficult. It’s a life that’s not for everyone. Knowing that it’s going to be like that, or it can be like that, is a good way for you to judge how you want to use your skills and your talents. If you want to stay in one city, maybe trying to go out to be in a huge band or something isn’t the best
of ideas. Or if you’re pretty homey, even one of the guys from Visionquest, Lee, he doesn’t like touring, he doesn’t like going out on the road, he likes sitting at home and drinking beer and barbecuing and chilling in the studio. He’s made that choice and that’s how his career panned out, whereas I live for
the road – I mean, I don’t live for it, but it’s something I’ve become accustomed to. Todd L. Burns So, does everyone in Visionquest sort of have a different function, in a way? Like, Lee is this guy who likes the studio, you like to go out and DJ all the time... Seth Troxler Yeah, I mean we all have different roles. A lot of the label and everything is run by Ryan and I. We come up with a lot of the concepts. I’m like a conceptual guy, Ryan is a business major, so he does a lot of the accounting and other stuff. Coming up with a crew or a business behind you is really important as well. If you’re going to do something, having a team. I mean, I now have maybe, at this point in my life, including the label and my management team and everything, about nine, ten people who work with us, around us. That’s even a small number. Todd L. Burns What was the moment at which you said, “I need a manager”? Seth Troxler Actually, kind of funny, my original manager over here, my friend Mike, he was my agent and then someone who just helped me along with things. But then, technically I got a manager manager, I switched to a larger agency, William Morris, it’s one of the bigger talent agencies in the world. To work with them you have to have a manager. But let’s say if you’re a rapper or a pop person,
it’s important to have someone, have that team out there representing you and making deals that you actually don’t have the time to do. It comes under time management. Todd L. Burns How did you choose them? Because, I think obviously having a manager, time management, but trusting them enough to make those decisions... Seth Troxler I always work with friends. Go on impressions, go on first, second impressions. Work with people that you actually trust. Some of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life have been not on-paper the best decisions, but they’ve been decisions that were good in my heart. Not the best decisions
on paper, but, let’s say, a couple of big labels have approached me, or big agencies, and they’re like, “Come with us, let’s do this.” And we were like, “My guys over here and we looked at how everything played out and it wasn’t the best for you.” Even though on paper it’s like, this looks money, this
could be good, or I’m about to join these hype people or whatever, it may actually not be. And that’s actually ruined a lot of people who took that decision, and I went the other way and then at the end I was like [grins] happy I went the other way, happy I took my own route. Going your own way and making your own thing is everything and goes back to the cake thing – like, why should I go and get somebody else’s cake, when they can kind of give you cake when they want to, when you can go and make your own thing. Stay close to those other people, you know, be polite, keep a working relationship with them, or a polite openness in case you guys do collaborate later. It’s cool and that’s one thing I’ve found with all those people who once offered me work or kind of wanted me to come with their crew and I was like, “Nah, dude, I’m straight.” They still will work with you because they still want something from you. They still want to be involved
with you. However, taking that step back and being like, “Yo, we can be involved together but I need to be in control of my own stuff,” they respect that at the end. At the moment, a lot of those bigger artists or agencies are
like, “F--- this guy, I can’t believe he just said that or led us on.” But then at the end of the day, we’ve always stayed in contact and they’ve been like, “Hey, would you come do this for us?” So, you still get to do those events or work with those artists, but you’re still in control of your own destiny. Todd L. Burns I think the point you say of them respecting your decision to control your own thing is an important one. Seth Troxler It’s all about doing everything; any business decision you make can be looked back at. Like I said earlier, about the country club thing – it’s about doing things respectfully the entire time, [from when] you take the step into this business to the point you take the step out, doing things the right way, with the right intentions. Don’t screw up your old friends or your old business partners, because a couple of years down the line those decisions are things that may really come back to bite you. When you treat everyone with respect, do everything the right way. Let’s say if you leave an agency, do it the right way. Like, “Hey, thank you.” There’s a proper way to do this. Just never be wrong. Todd L. Burns Don’t be a dick. Seth Troxler Don’t be a dick. I think that’s biggest thing. Do not be a dick. Seriously, it’s really important and it’s easy to get wrapped up in stuff. You’re like, “Yeah, this is cool,” and a couple of times I’ve started to be a dick and people are like, “Yo, you’re being a dick.” And I was like, “Maybe you’re right.” [laughter] But having the comfort in yourself to realize that, and when people give you suggestions, people that you trust, to take that and not having the ego and having a low ego to accept those ideas, that what really makes you and takes you to the next level as an artist, or whatever you want to do, is being humble and taking advice from people. Good and bad, but just take that advice. Listen when people talk to you, especially when people who have been working in things for a long time and who you respect tell you something and it’s like, “Maybe dude’s right.” You know? You can’t do it all on your own and you should make your own eyes and visions about things, but take advice from people. A lot of times people want to help you and want to help you for nothing else than just helping you. Also times, I think this is one thing you’ve got to really know, it’s like A Tribe Called Quest said, “Yo, the record industry is shady, so watch your back as well.” Look out for contracts, look out for clauses. This stuff is all really mega-important down the line, because loads of people get caught up in deals that, like I said, look good on the paper and
at the end of the day, it’s not good. You’re stuck and then you’re kind of pigeonholed. It’s happened to Prince or whatever, he had to change his name and stuff. It’s about being mindful about everything. Todd L. Burns I know earlier you said you’re quite eager to take questions from the audience. Seth Troxler Yeah, definitely. Todd L. Burns You’re wanting to give back, so why don’t we go ahead and open it up? Seth Troxler Please, that would be great. Do you guys need to take this microphone or do we share one? Does anyone have any questions? I don’t want to talk about myself too long. Audience Member Hey there. Seth Troxler How you doing? What’s your name, dude? Audience Member Alan. Seth Troxler Alan, how you doing? Audience Member Good, how are you? Seth Troxler Very well. I’m cool. Talking a lot. Audience Member Too much Red Bull, eh? Seth Troxler Yeah, it’s like my first one in years, but that blueberry jam, I was like, “This tastes like some cheap blueberry pancakes.” It does. Anyway, whatever. Todd L. Burns Expensive. [laughter] Audience Member I actually have a few questions. The first, you mentioned, you talked a lot about having respect with everybody when you’re dealing with contracts or... Seth Troxler Just life, from like the doorman to the guy in the bathroom to the guy throwing the party. Audience Member I find it’s been quite difficult to say no to people and maintain a good relationship with them afterwards. Even if you do it in the most respectful way, you hear things afterwards, like they started talking sh-- about you, if you say no to them. Or if you decline a proposition they’ll think you’re against them. So, how do you approach saying no to people? Seth Troxler That’s a funny one, because I’ve also had that same situation. It’s kind of funny, because at some point the people who really talk bad about you when you say no to them when they’re propositioning you, are often people who... I don’t know, in these situations where this has happened, have they been local people or more high up labels or other things like that? Audience Member I don’t know, it just seems to happen, not just to me, but I’ve seen it happen to a lot of people as well. If you just express that you’re not interested, but that you respect what they’re doing, there’s always like... Seth Troxler Just that, saying thank you, but no thank you, if they can’t respect that then it’s not someone you should be working with anyway, at the end of the day, because there’s going to be trouble. It’s a bit funny – this is really kind of tacky – but, it’s later on and it shows if things are going to be tidy when you’re working with someone. If someone can accept that you said no, maybe right now you don’t want to work with them, but later on you may come back and be like, “OK, actually let’s do something together now.” Where I have in my rider – this is really cheesy – I have Pimms and one pair of socks, that’s all I have. Pimms is this drink you can mix or whatever. And I got this thing out of this, I think they’re not Mötley Crue but... Todd L. Burns It’s the blue M&Ms. Seth Troxler The blue and red M&M thing. Everyone knows this? David Lee Roth had said that when they were doing their shows, they had this thing about two red to every blue M&M. And it’s not about the M&Ms or anything, it’s about the fact that when they showed up to those gigs, stadium-packing gigs, they realized that when they showed up and there was blue and red M&Ms, they knew the whole night was going to be sweet. They showed up, there was M&Ms, they were like, “These guys are paying attention to detail but not total attention.” Then they showed up and there’s no M&Ms, they’re like, “Yo, there’s going to be problems.” It’s like me showing up to a gig and there’s socks at the beginning and Pimms. I’m like, “Yo, cool, things are on point.” And 90% of the time the whole night goes without any issues, because I know these people are paying attention to detail, they’re always polite and nice. It’s kind of coming back to this. Finding red flags, I think is the biggest point. The more red flags you see, if a mouse looks like a mouse eating cheese, he might be a mouse. [laughter]
The more red flags you pick up upon meeting someone, or upon your business dealings, notice those and maybe feel
them out. Take that as, maybe this isn’t as good as it looks on paper. That’s a big thing, that’s really big. So, maybe these people are like, “Yo, I can’t believe that.” I also don’t know how you’ve said no to these people, but you seem like a really polite guy, so it’s just like, hey, they’re already tripping on you. Then later on, in your working relationship, they’ll probably have that same kind of possessiveness, which is something you really don’t want as an artist because it makes you feel trapped, I think, in many ways. Audience Member Second question: you’re on the road quite a bit and you have a girlfriend as you mentioned. How do you handle that? Seth Troxler [exhales] Todd L. Burns Maybe you should ask her. Seth Troxler Yeah, how does she handle it? Actually, it’s more on her side. I mean, I had a fiancée before this and this is when I was shooting for number one in a way and I was really, really determined on work, and she was a ballerina and she was really determined on work, and we couldn’t find time for each other. I’ve got to say, if you’re really working and travelling a lot, having a relationship is a horrible idea. This is bad to say, but it really doesn’t work and you don’t have that time to be attentive to another person. If you can see someone three times, four times a month, that’s not really a relationship in many ways. I mean, I’m in a
situation now where something happened and I’m dating one of my oldest friends, so we’re taking the opportunity and working with it. But also, she works in our industry, she does all the logistics for Richie Hawtin, so she knows how things work, she’s comfortable with that. I mean, if you’re trying to have a relationship with someone, generally in life, find someone who’s comfortable with you, and knows you and likes you and knows what they’re going to get. At the beginning I was like, “This is all I can offer. This is all it’s going to be, and this is how it’s going to be maybe for another ten years. Sorry.” [laughs] But they know. And transparency in anything in your life is really important. That’s, I think, everything if you’re trying to have a relationship, working or physical. Transparency is the point. Like, what are we working for? What’s going to happen here, what’s the future? This is what we can offer, are you comfortable with that? Maybe that sits well with saying no to people. Be like,
“Hey, I’d love to but this is all that I can offer. Currently, at this time, it’s not possible, but maybe let’s look towards the future and keeping this going.” That’s a good way to say no. I say that a lot; “I’d love to but I can’t, and have you met Alex my tour manager? Maybe talk to him a little bit more. I got to go.” “I’ve got to go,” is a good one. “I just farted,” as well. [laughter] Todd L. Burns Transparency, I appreciate that. Seth Troxler See? I farted, I told everyone. Transparent. [laughter] Audience Member OK, last question. You’re on the road, you said, about five times a week? Seth Troxler [addresses tour manager] Alex, what are we doing right now, four, five gigs a week? Four or five a week. Audience Member You’re staying up late, you’re probably consuming alcohol or whatever. Seth Troxler I don’t know, I feel I get loose, but other times I don’t get loose at all, so it’s about the balance. Audience Member OK, but you’re staying up late and then you have to wake up early to catch a flight with a germ-infested aeroplane. How do you stay healthy? Do you have any rituals to stay healthy when you’re on the road? Seth Troxler Kind of funny, we don’t. [laughs] We eat right. We eat real good, I eat constantly, as you can tell! [laughter] But no, I think one of the things is training your body to fit with your lifestyle. You know, some people go one route where they have to be really healthy. I’ve kind of just raved every weekend since I was 14, so my body’s kind of used to it. [laughs] Todd L. Burns So you need a decade-plus of experience to do it properly. Seth Troxler Yeah, no, but it’s kind of funny how your body changes. My body clock now knows that on the weekends it’s not going to really sleep, so even when I’m not doing that, my body knows at that time that it will be up for a long period of time. It’s training your body. It’s hard. I actually don’t get sick that often, which is really incredible. [coughs] Todd L. Burns He says, coughing. Seth Troxler Besides this cough that’s lasted my whole life. But it’s just about finding some balance and whatever works for you, in any way possible. I mean, touring is extremely hard and it’s not for everyone. That’s something people need to realize, because it’s easy to break down and it’s easy to wear yourself out. Like, right now I even think I’m touring too much and I’m trying to cut it
down for the next quarter, for the final quarter of the year. It’s strong, it’s very hard. What a lot of touring people don’t really understand is, let’s say you play until five AM, six AM or whatever. You’re done, your flight’s at ten, 11. Let’s say it’s ten. Six AM, you’re not really going to get to bed until seven, if you’re good. So then you’ve got two hours in bed, then you’ve
got to pack your stuff, go to the airport. And then you fly, transfer, get to the other city. You’ve got a couple more hours then you go to a dinner. You’ve got an hour before the show, two hours before the show, then you’re back in. You have a whole day and it seems like a lot of time, but it’s actually not a lot of time to just relax and lay down. So you’ve got to learn how to sleep on planes and buses and every single place you can, and rest when you can. Days when you’re off it’s like, “Yo, I’m just going to post up in room, watch crappy TV and sleep forever.” Todd L. Burns So, what are your travel essentials? Fresh socks? Seth Troxler Fresh socks, yeah. Straight up, fresh socks when you’re travelling all the time. If I could wear new socks every day, it would be like magic. Fresh socks at the airport when you’re looking horrible, your shirt’s open, you’re sweating, but you’re like, “I got new socks on, this is incredible!” [laughter] Todd L. Burns What else are the most important things you’re taking when you’re going on
tour? Seth Troxler Alex, my tour manager, [laughs] I think is pretty important for me. Just basic stuff. I
have loads of toothbrushes all the time. Any time you get a dental kit at a hotel, grab one, put it in your bag, eye mask. It’s pretty basic stuff. I don’t know how many people are touring here, but coming up with ways to make it comfortable for yourself, whatever it may be, bringing a friend, doing whatever you can just to be comfortable, living and easy. Todd L. Burns Did that answer your question? Audience Member Yes. Todd L. Burns Excellent. Seth Troxler That airborne stuff, what are those things called? Everescence, those are really good to have as much as possible. Audience Member What’s that? Seth Troxler Evanescence, they’re these kind of Alka Seltzer type tabs with loads of vitamins and stuff. Drink one of those every morning, twice a day. It’s kind of all the nutrients and calcium and all that stuff in it. Water. I don’t drink enough water, but if I drank more water I think I’d feel better and not be fat. Just eat well, drink a lot of water. Audience Member Vitamins. Seth Troxler I don’t really mess with vitamins so much, but those drinkable ones kind of work. I figure if you expose yourself to a lot of bacteria and then don’t allow it to live in your body, then your immune system builds. But if you take too many vitamins and stuff... I don’t know, I’m not a doctor. Todd L. Burns Did you have any more questions? Audience Member No, I’m good. Todd L. Burns OK, does anyone else? Audience Member Hey, how’s it going? Seth Troxler Yo, what’s up? Audience Member I’m just wondering, have you got any plans to get back in the studio and make some more music? Seth Troxler Yeah, definitely man. That’s one thing as well, this is a really good question. When you have time to make music, let’s say before success is really popping off, make as much music as physically possible. Because if you’re touring all the time, getting in the studio and just having the drive to want to make music, it gets lower and lower. And that’s something I don’t think a lot of people really understand. Some artists are great about that, they can multi-task and be on the road. Like Jamie Jones, he can be on the road five days a week, then those two days be up in the studio. I got two days off, I’m sitting on the couch. I’m going to my room and eating my motherf---ing Chinese food. [laughter] I don’t know if anybody watches Curb, but yeah. [laughs] It’s about finding time to really do your craft. I spend a lot of time on buying records and looking for music and then over the past, I think,
two or three years, I’ve only done collaborations. Also, because I’m always away, I don’t like making music in headphones. It’s hard to get studio time or rebuild your studio. I’ve moved and done all these things, lost things, broken computers and then just building a new studio again’s been kind of hard. I’ve kind of recently built a studio in London and we’re going to build one this summer in Ibiza to work on music, and I’ve got a project coming up where I’m doing a remix for Wild Nothing. I’m getting back in the remix game, I just did a remix for Matt Dear, slowly, because it’s a bit easier to work with parts than to come up with new concepts. Also, I took a bit of time off to really develop what I wanted to do with music. It’s good to make music to make music, but it’s not good to put out music just to put out music. That’s something that’s important. Just because you’re making loads of stuff, doesn’t mean everything has to come out. Put out stuff when it’s really good. That’s one thing that’s helped, I think, my career in many ways. I’ve always put out music that was good on bigger labels, or projects that were worthwhile, rather than, “Alright, I’m going to find so-and-so, like, some cat on the internet wants to put out some tracks of mine.” Sure, just doing a bunch of stuff with small labels, it doesn’t really have the impact for you as an artist that takes you to another level. If you’re going to put out music, if you put out music on bigger labels, instantly you’re in the same tier as the other artists on those labels, so you’re looked at, at that tier. One thing with music is, and being booked as an artist, there’s about five or six different tiers or levels that you go in. There’s the booking fee, the guy you can book at your local bar for like 100 bucks, and there’s the 100 to, let’s say, 300 dollar range, and there’s like three to seven, and then 700 to like 1500, and then there’s 2000 to 3000, and three to five, and then five and up. These are kind of the tiers that things go in and when you’re in the five to tens then you’re just kind of there and your gigs range between three to 30, 40 grand. It just depends on what your standing is. Todd L. Burns Going back to the releasing music thing, what if these big labels aren’t calling? Seth Troxler If the big labels aren’t calling, and you’re sending stuff out – this is the thing, they don’t have to be majors, but respected labels. That can be a small, independent label like my own. Independent, respected labels is a lot better than putting out a record on an unknown independent label, because you’re still crawling your way up. They’re even fighting to get any exposure,
so you’re not going to get any exposure. Even if it may be a great tune, it still may not hit like it can. And being really conscious about where you put out your music, when you put out your music, how often you put out your music... One mistake a lot of artists have, “OK, I’m going to put out a lot of music on a bunch of different labels and it’s cool because all these labels are hot right now.” It doesn’t really build you as an artist. It’s better to pick, let’s say, a couple of crews you’re down with or one crew, hopefully... stick with them, build something, build a plan. Let’s say you want to have three records a year. You shouldn’t really put out more than four singles, five singles a year. Five is a lot already. Three, four is good. Quarterly is alright, but I think three good records a year, maybe a couple of remixes... Being out in the press is good, but not having loads like people who’ve put out a record every couple of weeks on a different label. It doesn’t really help your discography much and also the quality control isn’t as high. Quality control is so important, and sitting on music until the quality is good enough. So what if people aren’t calling right the next day? If you keep keeping on, and you keep those relationships open with these labels and the people who work there, go out and be part of things. One thing that’s super, super important is being involved in the scene, and going out, going around the world and meeting
people. A couple of people who are in here, I’ve seen around the world and they’re out. There’s this guy in Detroit, this kid Ted Crisco, he’s started this group. He’s like a new Detroit kid and one thing we’ve really noticed is, for the past two years... I mean, we didn’t really know Ted, I knew him a little bit before, but now we see him everywhere, and he’s grinding. He’s there, he’s at every festival, he’s there meeting people, he’s having a good time, and
everyone starts to know him. You’re like, “Woah, there’s that kid again.” I mean, I was that kid forever. I was that kid, I was everywhere, never really talking about myself but just hanging out. You meet people and they’re like, “What’s up? It’s you again.” You start to talk and things start to naturally progress and happen. That’s a lot of things in life. It’s not what you do but who you know and that’s a truth in life. You can have a great degree from a great school, but if you have horrible networking skills and aren’t the best person to be around, chances are things aren’t going to go so well for you. You can have nothing in life, but if you’re out, you’re meeting people constantly and people are remembering you, the chances are the quicker it will be that they want to ask you to do something for them. I know with our label, we don’t sign anyone that we don’t really know, because also at the end of the
day, when you’re having a label or building a family, you want the people on your label to also... They’re people who are going to represent you as a label worldwide. You don’t want some kid who’s screaming your label’s name all over the world and being a dick. You just like, god, because people are like, “That crew, they’re suspect.” It’s about going out, meeting people and going globally, thinking global. Thinking global is everything. Don’t think local, think global, and get involved. The more you get involved, the more you meet people, the easier it is to place your music in places that are of status. I never sent out a demo once in my life to a label, I had just met people around the world. Or even my DJ sets, I just met people from going out and they’re like, “Oh, you’re cool, I heard you play me cool music,” or, “Hey, send us something, I’m really interested,” because you’ve already taking that step. You’re already in, rather than blind sending people stuff. This is something I wanted to touch on earlier; if you’re sending music out, do not send links to your SoundCloud. It’s, as a label, instant no interest. It’s cool but once you click on a song, and it’s not out, but it’s been heard by 2000 people or whatever, you’re like, “I don’t want that. I have no interest in that.” Even though it might be hot, you’re just like, no. It’s not there. Personalize things. Make things for that label. Start to meet the people first, from those labels. Build some interest with them so that you guys are talking and then be like, “Hey, I’m making this for you, even though it may not fit at that time.” We’ve got artists who it’s taken a year, two years of them sending us music, where we’re finally like, “Yeah, this is right.” And then they come into the family. We’ll be like, “Alright, so we’re going to put you out on this compilation now, then we’re going to make a plan for you to have a single then and then it’s like boom, boom, boom, boom.” This is the natural progression of how a lot of labels and things work; truly this is how the game works, so getting out there and just being involved with those things is really what’s going to push you further. Todd L. Burns So to answer your question, he’s working on some remixes. Seth Troxler Yeah. [laughs] Audience Member Thanks. [laughter] Seth Troxler Yeah, I got some new hot jams. Audience Member Are you feeling a bit more pressure now that you’re Resident Advisor number one and a lot of people maybe looking at you more? Seth Troxler Completely, and that’s one reason why I kind of stopped making music in a way. Because the more success you get, the more people want to judge you, in one way, but also, if you make a couple of wrong steps then it’s gone. That’s music, people are fickle, things are forever changing. You do kind of get this thing in your mind where you’re like, “Woah, if I mess up then it could be over tomorrow.” That’s a lot of pressure in itself, especially the higher you go, just falling is a fear. Let’s say, I make this single and I think it’s cool and then it gets horrible reviews, and then I do another single and it gets horrible reviews – two or three of those in a row, you’re not the flavour of the week anymore, you’re something that people used to know. That’s scary. That also goes back to the whole thing of releasing too much music. You might have put out a couple of tracks in a row that were hot and then you put out three that weren’t. It completely erases the build or the pressure that you got from the couple of tracks that were great. Journalists really want to report on you when you’re starting, but as soon as you f--- up they stop talking about you, and that’s not what you want as an artist. You just want to kind of put your foot in the water of media. Your foot’s always in the water; you’re around, but you’re not down, and that keeps you in the know or people remembering you and that’s really important. I mean, to be always in view but not like, [stands and waves] “Hey, it’s me all the time!” It gets annoying for anyone in any scene in any type of genre of music. You don’t want to be annoying, but you want to be there. Todd L. Burns You, last year at WMC, I don’t know if you knew what was going to happen, but Resident Advisor followed you around the entire week and you basically said, “Yeah, no problem, follow me around the entire week, say whatever you want about it.” Was that a conscious decision? Was the timing right for you? Seth Troxler It was a crazy time. It was like an exposé. I was going through a really weird period of my life. My fiancée at the time had just left me a week or two prior. I’m like this emotional breakdown of touring too much, as well as heartbroken, and then I’ve got this guy trailing us around. And I’m also into transparency. Some artists don’t want the media to know anything and that’s really your own choice, but my whole thing has been like, “I’m a normal guy, what you see is what you get,”, type of thing. The guy Will, who was doing the article, was telling me the ideas behind the whole thing and I think part of the reason why you guys chose me was the fact that I’m so open. So it ended up working out really well to give a true artist profile, what it’s like to be in someone like myself’s shoes. It’s kind of funny since after the article, because sometimes people can be really invasive into your life and really grabby, people attacking me and stuff and they touched on that in the article, and after that now people are really polite if they want a picture or something. They’re like, “Hey, is it cool?” At some point, at that time it was like success for me went very fast. I think it’s better if things go slower and you slowly make your way up. I mean, I’ve been in the game for a while, so it was like, [mimes a progression] “duh-duh-duh”, and then it was just like, “boom!”. Which was surprising and it’s hard to adjust, I think, in many ways. Some people can adjust. I have the sort of personality where it’s been easier for me, but at the same time at some points you can’t deal with it. I mean, that weekend I’m trying to deal with my life and you have to be on all the time, trying to personable to people. Your life is basically just been destroyed in front of your face and you’ve got to smile when you’re playing six parties, but all you want to do is go sit in a corner by yourself and be alone and cry. And then people are asking for pictures and you smile and you’re like, “Hey, yeah, great!” But [mimes holding a phone] your ex-fiancée just left you the most horrible, damaging message of your life, and you’re like, “Wow, thanks for calling me right before I play in front of 2000 people.” It’s trying to keep on your own game and staying there, and being aware of that. There’s your personal life and then there’s work. Life can be hard, man. The game’s not easy. You guys have all signed up for something that few will attain, and once you attain it is a different life, but it is all you’ve worked for. I think many of you have worked your whole life to get to this position now, or to be in this room, and that’s special and congratulations. I couldn’t make it to this room and I tried, so it’s kind of funny, but it’s important to realize what you have in store and what life can be, or what this world can be like. Todd L. Burns Are there any other questions, or did you even have one more? Audience Member That’s it, thanks. Audience Member Hi. Seth Troxler Hi, how are you doing? Audience Member I’m pretty good. You mentioned playing Ibiza, EDC, and all these different things, and as a DJ I feel like you go from playing some after-hours with your friends, with like 100 people, to then the next day playing for 10,000 people somewhere. Where do you stand on how you modify your set to play, let’s say, something like EDC, which is maybe 6,000 American younger kids, versus then going to play at Space in Ibiza versus then going to play at Berghain or something like that? Seth Troxler It’s funny that you say that, because at the beginning of the year I took this conscious decision to go strictly back to vinyl. I was like, “Yo, I’m number one, I’m about to get real! This is what’s up.” Trying to almost defend myself to my friends who constantly make fun of me, which is what your friends do. It keeps you grounded. So I was like, “Yeah, you guys want to blag me? Bam! How you like me now? I’m going to play records.” And it was a great idea, still I’m playing records. I had to learn how to use these guys, [points to desk] the CDJs, recently because I didn’t have that versatility any more. I think as a DJ, the biggest advantage you have is being able to play different music at different times for different situations. And playing all music – I mean, that’s something I’ve always prided myself on. I play so much different music. Whether you’re playing at a restaurant really quietly, playing jazz music to people eating, or you’re playing at a rave to 15-20,000 people, having the music that fits and curating music that fits that situation is technically your job. A lot of DJs pigeonhole themselves, or no matter what, they only play one style of music. I don’t think that really works. Either way, back to your question. At the beginning of the year, I was playing – I had two huge record bags, you know – and I’m playing situations where sometimes the night before I’m playing an underground club in Amsterdam like Trouw or something, where people are there for that music, and then I get on a flight and I come over here or go somewhere else in England and I’m playing to younger kids, who are also maybe deeper than the EDC crowd, but also young kids and want the hits. And I’ve got all these obscure records I bought from the ‘90s, and kids really started blagging me. Some people really got it but some people were like, “What’s this guy up here doing playing all these acid records? I want to hear some hits. Supposedly, mister number one isn’t so good at all.” And the records don’t work and you’ve got hums and stuff, so I had to change up again and bring in the CDJs [points to desk] to fit those situations, you know? It’s about using the technology that we have today to be able to have music for every situation and to fit every crowd, and having that intuitive feeling with people to know the music to play for that time period, and for that space. That’s the biggest thing, I guess, really using a mix of technologies to do what you can do best in whatever that is that you’re doing; playing music for the time, and having the right amount of... The more you play out, the more experiences you have, the more you can judge crowds and you can judge the situations that you’re in. So that helps a lot, experiences. Also going out to a lot of different parties and a lot of different events and experiencing things helps a lot with your musical taste and how you perform at different shows. But yeah, just having a lot of music on you. And don’t limit yourself, because once I limited myself I couldn’t perform in the same way that I used to be able to perform and it was a big challenge for me. I started getting down and I was doubting myself and everything. That self-doubt, that inherent, forever self-doubt keeps you driven as an artist, but you’re also in this place, you’re like, “Wow, what’s happening?” You’re trying to keep it. So, have just a lot of music on hand. I know when I was using Traktor I had over 10,000 songs on my computer, meticulously organized in different genres of music, so I always had music for that period of time. Then when you switch from 10,000 songs to 150 songs it’s hard to make things work. But just having a lot of different music I think is the best way to do things. I now use two turntables and a USB, so I keep the new bombs, unreleased stuff, hands in the air stuff; if it’s 5,000 people, EDC crowd, some stuff that’s a bit more pop... One big point too is, just because playing a bigger show, never compromise. It can be a big, hands-in-the-air type of song for a certain crowd, but it still should be something that you like, not something that you’re just playing because you know the kids will like it. Also, this goes with having a wide range of taste. I’m sorry for being so long-winded on these questions you asked. I’m getting anxious as well, but yeah, having a wide range of taste. But don’t ever be like, “OK, I’m supposed to play this stuff to these people, because this is what they’re supposed to like, so I’m going to do that.” That doesn’t really define you as an artist and that’s how you start to sell out. It’s all about playing what you like but playing it in the right way to the right people. It’s kind of hard to explain, but I think you guys get my point. Audience Member This is just analogous to that or like an add-on. Is there ever a situation where like... I see a lot of artists come and play, and I feel like people want to hear the kind of music that they put out on their records or whatever. And they come to the club and they play not even just a more amped-up version of that, but literally completely different music. Is there ever a situation where it’s too confusing for people? Like, if you’re in a bar playing house but you make the hardest dubstep, is that not a problem? Seth Troxler Yeah. I’ve let a lot of people down and got boos and all sorts of stuff. Todd L. Burns I guess that’s the advantage of not putting out records for you. No one knows exactly what you sound like. Seth Troxler Exactly, that is kind of an advantage. It’s kind of funny, the records I do put out I still don’t really play. There’s this track I did recently, “Caller #7”, this remix, and people were like, “Play “Caller #7”!” I’m like, [whispers] “I don’t have it...” Or that track you played earlier, that “Party Guilt”, I never played that song. My friends were making it in our house and I helped them with the bassline and then I talked over it and I went back to my room and took a nap. Then it came out and it did well and people were asking for the song all the time and I was like, “I don’t like the song, personally.” That’s the worst, is when people expect something from you, and then they’re like, “Why didn’t you do that?”, or whatever. “That’s kind of not what I do. I hope you enjoyed it, but... Sorry.” [laughs] It’s a lot of times. I’ve had times when I’m playing and it’s been booked at the wrong club or whatever or something’s happening and no matter what, it just doesn’t work. You’re like, “Bam, this one, ha!” And it’s like, nope. You’re thinking like, “I got – bam! Ha, this worked last time.” Nope. It just doesn’t work sometimes. Sometimes it’s really hot and sometimes it’s just like, “Man, people hate me.” And that’s just part of the game. If you look at it like baseball, batting 300 is really good, so if you’re a DJ or a musician, let’s say you bat 700, or 80% of the time it’s really good, there’s still that 20% of the time. There’s still some nights that are just not good and it’s not going to work no matter work. It beats you up and you beat yourself up about it. That’s one thing about being an artist, you’re never satisfied. On occasion you’re like, “That was good,” but at the end of the day, sometimes too just know that it’s not going being a good night, the cards may not play together. That’s part of the game. Trying to bat as high as possible, or trying to do as best as you can, that’s the main point, but sometimes it’s just not going to be good. You’re not going to make everybody happy, and that’s just how it is. If you can do that, wow, you’re going to be the best ever, but no one can do that. That’s just not how it works as a DJ. Maybe as a live, but even as a live sometimes things just don’t go right, and the night’s just not working out, the vibe’s not there. There’s some type of distance and you’ve got to get through that time as best as you can, but sometimes it’s just sh--. That’s just how it works. Todd L. Burns Are there any other questions? Audience Member Hi, nice meeting you. Seth Troxler Nice to meet you as well. Audience Member And thanks for being here. Seth Troxler It’s my pleasure, thank you. Audience Member You’ll be playing at Sónar festival in Barcelona in a couple of weeks. You mentioned that you tour a lot, so are you in the position that you can actually stay at the festival and enjoy it, and see some other artists? Seth Troxler The thing with Sónar, normally I go the entire weekend, the whole week I stay. This is the first year I think in maybe four or five years that I’m not going to be there the whole time. I’m going to be there the Saturday night and then the Sunday I’m going to do a secret, pop-up type thing. But yeah, that’s a really big thing, seeing other artists and being open to other music and going and seeing people play. That’s something that a lot of people stopped doing. Todd L. Burns What was the last best DJ set you saw, from the crowd? Seth Troxler The last best DJ set I saw? It was really great seeing Gerd and Ben the other day at our party in Detroit. I mean, that’s why I brought them in, I was like, “I really want to see Gerd and Ben play.” It’s dope music, so that was great. Other shows that I’ve been really excited to see... Todd L. Burns Is there are particular Sónar moment that you can remember from years past? Seth Troxler I’ve only gone to Sónar by Night like once or twice because – this is also really funny – I really have problems with big crowds. [laughs] If I’m in a crowd I freak out and get really panicky, which is kind of funny because I play in front of crowds all the time. But if I have to be in the party, I get
weird, which is odd. Todd L. Burns That’s a DJ thing. Seth Troxler Yeah! [laughs] It’s funny because you go from being completely alone and then in front of tons of people. That’s a life that it becomes. But going back to your question, I wish I had more time to stay. I’ll get there early in the day, check out as much of the festival as I can. I like Sónar by Day quite a bit, Sónar by Day is amazing. There’s more experimental things, a lot of art. It’s about finding people that have concepts and that you can kind of draw from, repeat and come up with ideas. It’s truly important, also to stay current, seeing what else is in your scene. [sneezes] Audience Member Bless you. Seth Troxler Yeah, a little bit of action here. Todd L. Burns Yeah, for a guy who doesn’t get sick you’re certainly playing your A-game here. Well, you’ll be around today for a little bit, so... Seth Troxler Yeah, I’ll be around, so if anyone wants to come up to me and ask me any questions or anything, feel free. Todd L. Burns Definitely. Seth Troxler I’m gonna go wash my hands, so you can shake and we can talk. Todd L. Burns Yeah, do not shake his hands right now. But, please give a hand to Seth Troxler. Seth Troxler Thank you so much.

Title: Wheedle’s Groove

Wheedle’s Groove
Wheedle’s Groove takes you straight into Seattle’s blossoming funk and soul scene of the late ’60s and early ’70s. At the time, there were over 20 live music clubs specializing in funk and soul and even more bands with big afros and crazy spacesuits, releasing 45 after 45. Most of these releases are still sought after by crate-diggers today. Before teaming up on Wheedle’s Groove, Robert Nesbitt spent his early days as a disc jockey at KYAC while Tony Gable played in the funk band Cold, Bold & Together. In this talk at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, Nesbitt and Gable talk firsthand about the great soul era of Seattle.
Hosted by TOBY LAING To my left we have Robert Nesbitt, originally from KYAC and various other institutions. [applause] ROBERT NESBITT Thank you. TOBY LAING And to his left we have got Tony Gable, who is a musician from the Seattle scene and he worked around the world as a bassist in their time. And we are lucky to have these guys here today, so… ROBERT NESBITT Thank you for having us here. [applause] TOBY LAING I don’t know, because you guys are close to the source, so it is hard to kind of have the same perspective as I might have coming from New Zealand and kind of just putting in that Wheedle’s Groove CD, and wondering, “What is this?” Wondering what it was and just getting to hear this really incredible underground soul music, which I’d never heard before. And I like to go around and try to check out as much rare stuff as I can, and I mean, to hear that stuff - that blew me away. I don’t know how it is for you guys, if it’s something you just take for granted or if it’s something that you see as a special time? ROBERT NESBITT I know for me, as a kid growing up, back in western New York, I lived in a neighborhood that was full of music. I come from a family very much entrenched in music, music was all around me. My heritage is based upon music, from gospel to blues to jazz to whatever. So I was always a part of that, that was driven through me, that was always a part of me, always in me. As a kid growing up, I listened to just about everything. My mother listened to all types of music, from classical to gospel to the Dorsey Brothers on radio. I listened to Frank Sinatra, and as a kid who grew up in the ’70s, we watched this movement, the genesis of rock & roll, which came about from gospel, of course, from jazz, to intermingling with pop music as well. So coming up in the mid-’50s these things were starting to happen, the Chuck Berrys, the James Browns, the Elvis Presleys. So all of this music was part of my early coming up. Being that I lived in New York and I’d spent a lot of time in Detroit, Michigan, I would always travel to Detroit, which is the home of Motown. So, in the late ’50s and early ’60s this was just blowing up, just a big, huge expansion of music, something new that America had never heard of before, to something that was going to pretty much explode internationally. So that takes you through the late ’60s into the ’70s here. I wasn’t the only person that felt that way. There were artists here in Seattle who had those same types of feelings about music and a desire to be a part of that. What happened with that is that we - I would say most of the artists - felt that they wanted to be a part of that, so what they did was, through their God-given creative talents, created some music. Something that was pleasing to them, something that they felt that people around them wanted to hear. TOBY LAING So, for you, Tony, coming up as a musician in Seattle, because you weren’t always from Seattle… TONY GABLE No. TOBY LAING Where were you are originally from? TONY GABLE I’m originally from San Antonio, Texas, but I’m an Air Force brat, so we moved about every four years and I actually kind of grew up in Great Falls, Montana. Not exactly a home for a soul station. So I didn’t really get to hear a lot of soul music other than Motown and stuff like that. Actually, my influences at that time were the British Invasion: The Beatles, Dave Clark Five, that’s all I listened to. The Rolling Stones, Herman’s Hermits, stuff like that. And then, when we moved back to Texas, my cousins were like [raises hands in shock], “Oh my God! What’s with the bell-bottoms? [audience laughs] The polka dot shirt, the hip-huggers, the granny glasses?” They just warned me, we were going to get in a fight every day, because I went to a half black and half Chicano - you know, Latino school, so they said, “We’re going to get fighting every day, you have got to get out of those clothes and put on some Converse, some sharkskin pants,” and so I totally got immersed into… ROBERT NESBITT Sharkskin suits. TONY GABLE [laughs] Yeah, into soul music, so kind of from this area totally over to that. And when we moved up here to the Northwest, I decided that I didn’t want to move again every four years – so, I went to Western to be a fine arts teacher. I actually have a degree in graphic design, and by the way, a lot of people met at art school: U2 [in Robert Nesbitt’s direction], you know, Talking Heads. ROBERT NESBITT Mick Jagger was an artist. TONY GABLE Yeah. And so I met musicians, and, you know, they were cool. You know, as an art major you really were not cool. And I would be in my room painting oil paintings and all the musicians were partying, getting free beer, a lot of great-looking women, free popcorn [audience laughs]. So I said, “Hey, I want to be in the band.” They said, “You don’t play an instrument.” “Oh.” Then I saw the movie Woodstock and saw Santana and that just blew me away. I was like, “I don’t know what this guys are beating, but I think they are called congas or something, bongos, I’m just going to teach myself how to play,” because again, there is not a heavy Latino community in Bellingham. So I just started listening to the records. My mother had Mongo - besides Bobby “Blue” Bland, she also had Mongo Santamaría. So I listened to that, you know, James Brown had some congas, a lot of Motown - actually, as I started to playing, I started noticing percussion more. So if you listen to a lot of the old Motown hits, the guy, his name was Eddie “Bongo” Brown, he would be playing bongos, and they had great percussionists, tambourines, all kind of stuff. So I really got into it, talked myself into the band by doing the posters and designing the outfits, and they let me in the band, and then we moved to Seattle in ’71, and about that time, that’s when I met Bobby, Robert Nesbitt, he was a DJ at KYAC. We started up our friendship, and we have just been hanging ever since. The times changes, the music changes, but the friendship has been there the whole time. ROBERT NESBITT Say, I wanted to be a musician, coming up, I was in junior high school. In high school I played bass, but I played it so poorly. It kind of reminds me of a lot of managers of baseball. Baseball managers usually were not great, they weren’t great position players but they knew the game very well. I was not a good musician, but I enjoyed music so much, I said, “What is the best thing for me to do if I enjoy music so much? Hey! You know what I’ll do? I play records on the radio!” So I was 16 years old, living in Buffalo in New York, and I got my first job on radio. Then, in ’72 I moved to Seattle. [to Tony Gable] I think I met you a week after I got here. Tony was playing a gig at this place called The Norselander, remember that gig? TONY GABLE Oh, God. ROBERT NESBITT That was back thirty-something years ago, but we have been friends ever since. TONY GABLE But when we moved here, obviously [Jimi] Hendrix was a big influence, and the first name of our band was called Funk Experience. And my first gig was with a group called… We opened for a group called the Chambers Brothers, I don’t know if you guys are probably too young to remember “Time Has Come Today?” So that was my first gig, and I was like, “Wow, this is cool.” And when you start playing you think, “We’re going to have a hit record next year, we’re going to be huge, touring all over the world.” ROBERT NESBITT Of course. TONY GABLE That didn’t happen for another 15 years, another 20 years [everybody chuckles]. But luckily my mum was always supportiv. When I told her that I was going to quit college to go play music and bongos, she really wasn’t too keen on that. “But as long as you don’t move home and don’t go to jail, then it’s cool with me.” ROBERT NESBITT See, because you are not always going to be 20. That’s it. You are not figured about being 30 or 25 or having mortgages or anything, you just want to play music. TONY GABLE Yeah, and we just played at that time in Seattle. I was in a group called Cold, Bold & Together before we moved here. A lot of groups had horns, so it would be more like Tower Of Power, not really a lot of background singers, it was a horn group with a lead singer - whereas we were kind of the opposite. We had a very small rhythm section and, at first, no keyboards, but we sang a lot - kind of like Bloodstone, I don’t know if anybody remembers that group. So we sang a lot, and that was what made us stand out from some of the other bands, of course we used to do the Funky Chicken and the Penguin and danced when we played and… TOBY LAING This is something that I kind of try to get a handle on, but it seems like there were a lot of bands in Seattle at that time playing party music, soulful party music. TONY GABLE Well, a lot of them are on Wheedle’s Groove. ROBERT NESBITT I would say at one time there were probably 20 working bands, bands that worked every week. And there were venues where all of these bands could find work from Canada, from Vancouver down to Tacoma. So there was never a lack of places for bands to play, plus the radio station was so key in supporting those bands. Every band had a record, everybody had a record and it was incumbent upon us, and me specifically as the program director and the music director of that radio station, to support those bands. And also this music was really good music. It just blew us away that this music was actually coming out of Seattle. Everything else on our playlist was coming from Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, those different sounds we were so immersed in that we didn’t realise that we were developing a Seattle sound. There was a Seattle sound. TOBY LAING So everybody at the radio station was feeling the same way? ROBERT NESBITT Absolutely. TOBY LAING It was like something you had to get behind? ROBERT NESBITT Absolutely. TONY GABLE Well, we kept thinking that, “OK, San Francisco was exploding, so you keep going up north - well, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, we were next.” And a lot of that did happen later with the garage, grunge and rock that did happen, but in that soul era there was just so much music and so many different kind of bands. Pure vocalists, horn bands, funk bands, and there were a lot of rock groups playing around too. We kind of were on different sides of the town. There was not necessarily a set of railroad tracks, but we kind of played certain clubs and then they played different kind of clubs, and then occasionally we came together and played. There was a group called Ballin’ Jack that was on Columbia, so… Hendrix was huge, of course, and a lot of groups from California like War, for example, would come up here, a lot of people came up here to gig in Portland and in Seattle. A lot of those groups are represented on Wheedle’s Groove. There was a group called Acapulco Gold. I mean, just tons of great bands. But we did play every day of the week. I mean, we didn’t make any money, but we did play a lot. ROBERT NESBITT Yeah. TOBY LAING Do you mind if I just play a song off Wheedle’s Groove, maybe a Cold, Bold & Together track, just to give the people an idea of the sound we’re talking about? TONY GABLE Too bad that they can’t see the photo because I designed the outfit, so we had this huge bell-bottoms. I mean, two people could stand there under my bell-bottoms. ROBERT NESBITT They were spacesuits, actually big spacesuits. TONY GABLE [points towards CD decks] Oh, this is going to be modern! Oh, you got the Wheedle’s Groove CD. TOBY LAING So, just imagine those spacesuits at this point. TONY GABLE Big ’fros, we used to… (music: Cold, Bold & Together - “(Stop) Losing Your Chances”) TONY GABLE A few comments. If you know about producing, you don’t want a band to produce a song. Because we would be mixing, “I can’t hear the bass enough.” Bass is up. “I don’t hear my congas.” Congas were up. “I don’t hear my voice.” So nothing really changes, the mix is just all in your face [audience laughs]. So after these recordings, then we started getting producers to help us. Yeah, pretty funny. And, by the way, that’s one of the first recordings that Kenny Gorelick is on, you just know him as Kenny G. TOBY LAING He was ripping it up there, I heard that, it sounded great. So you had horns at this point, that’s something you added to the band? TONY GABLE Well, we had to add horns because we were singers, but most of the bands in Seattle had horns, so we said, “OK, let’s get some horns.” And then somebody brought this kid from Franklin, Kenny, and I said, “Ah, I don’t want him in the band, he’s kind of geeky.” You know, we just called him the poodle. Instead of an afro, he had all this big curly hair. Plus most of the bands we were kind of looking up like to, like Earth, Wind & Fire, Kool & The Gang, all these groups we got to open for later, so that was nice. Ohio Players - they didn’t have any black people in them, I mean any white people in them. So it was like, “Wait a minute.” But then we started to think about what War does, and so does Sly & The Family Stone, so then we kind of changed our way of thinking. You know, this is early ’70s, so we were right at the height of black power, and so we were like, “No, I don’t want to integrate.” So actually through music is where I learned a lot of different things about diversity. Like, the first time we went over to our keyboard player, Philip Woo, who is actually the keyboard player in Maze - I don’t know if you have ever heard of Frankie Beverly and Maze – I saw this hundred-pound bag of rice, and I was like, “You guys do need rice!” I didn’t know - and they didn’t know what I was talking about with chitlins and greens, you know? And I didn’t know anything about yiddish things or, you know… So it was great for all the groups in Seattle, just getting to know each other in the band and meeting other band members. It was a very healthy and strong competition. Because one night, on Tuesday you’d go to see a band like Family Affair, what are they doing? You check them out and then you go home and practice. And then you break out your new stuff. And at first, most of the groups in Seattle were playing covers. So, as soon as Earth, Wind & Fire’s album came out (snaps), you got it, and learned it, and be the first band on the scene that played the Earth, Wind & Fire song, or the Dramatics, or Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, who we actually got to open for. We had a lot of opportunities, and a lot of that has to do with Robert and the radio station, and promoters thinking, “Hey, we have some pretty good groups here, so we’re going to allow them to open,” and so… ROBERT NESBITT It was just an opportunity for the local artists to play, to have your name on the billboard with a major act. Tony’s band, Cold, Bold & Together, played with just about everybody, every time somebody would come. Who had you guys played with? You played with Kool & The Gang, you played with Earth, Wind & Fire, played with Bobby Womack. TONY GABLE What’s with the Funky Chicken, what’s his name? ROBERT NESBITT Rufus Thomas. TONY GABLE We had backed up Rufus Thomas. ROBERT NESBITT And back in the ’70s Seattle was the type of town, as I mentioned before, where there were so many different venues, and it was a seven-night-a-week town. Right now, Seattle is a one-night-every-two-weeks town, where you really have to look for something to happen here. And there used to be a time when I know working at the radio station, somebody would be at the Trojan… Isaac Hayes would be at the Trojan Horse, Donny Hathaway would be playing at the Paramount, B.B. King would be at the Heritage House, and we had to juggle who we were going to interview that day. Because conceivably we would have - and I remember, this happened - one time, B.B. King was going to come at three o’clock in the afternoon to do an interview, but at the same time we had Isaac Hayes scheduled. You know, that was just a great problem to have, but you don’t have that in Seattle. But getting back to what’s happening about the quote-unquote [air quotes] local bands. They had an opportunity to show their talents on a major stage. When the artist that they opened for went away, they always talked about these guys, and plus it just made me feel good. TONY GABLE And you learned from actually playing with the people you looked up to. ROBERT NESBITT Right. TONY GABLE That they were also having difficulties. The time we played with Kool & The Gang. Even though they had hit records, we were playing at a small club. Seven nights we opened for them and they really weren’t doing that well. We were like, “Wait a minute. We’re trying to get to where you are, and you’re saying it’s kind of tough?” ROBERT NESBITT Everybody thought just because you had a record deal you had money. That wasn’t the case. TONY GABLE Yeah, it took crossing over in getting on the pop charts for a lot of these major artists to start making some dough. I remember when Earth, Wind & Fire was pushing their own equipment, just like we were. We were like, “Where’s your roadies?” But again, we kind of stopped playing covers all the time because everybody was starting to find their own voice, their own perspective. So groups like Cooking Bag and Family Affair, Black And White Affair, Broham, everybody started to say, “OK, it’s great we’re playing all these other people’s songs, but are they going to remember us?” So everybody started doing originals. And sometimes we just played jazz. One time we got fired. We were supposed to be playing a Bee Gees song. That’s when I had a first tenor [points to throat] and falsetto, but… ROBERT NESBITT “Lonely days, lonely nights, where would I be without my woman?” [Tony Gable chuckles] TONY GABLE So, the club owner wanted us to play a Bee Gees song, because that was the thing. This is just in the transition from original heavy R&B music to disco, which we were like, “Ah man, do we have to…? You know, the Bee Gees are cool, but do we have to play them? [sings] ‘Hi, hi, hi, hi, staying alive,’ you know? Better than that, though [audience chuckles].” And so the bass player started playing “Red Clay” off CTI [sings the bassline]. ROBERT NESBITT Freddie Hubbard. TONY GABLE And we just broke into a jazz song. We got fired. They just said, “No, no, only dance music, only disco.” Well, so we - I can’t speak for everybody, but most of the groups just started doing their own things and making their own records, and sold them out of the back of their car. And these guys [points at Robert Nesbitt] would help us by playing our music on the radio, and we’d be driving down the street and that was such a cool feeling to hear your song on the radio. “Hey, this is Robert Nesbitt; hey, this is Cold, Bold & Together.” And then people didn’t believe us. We used to drive an old Buick Deuce and a Quarter, and we’d roll down the windows: “That’s us! That’s us! That’s us!” “Oh yeah, right, you guys with the big hats and the ‘fros?” We never combed our hair, by the way. When we’d take off our hats, we’d have these big ’fros sticking out here [everybody laughs]. ROBERT NESBITT Oh, God. Oh, man. TONY GABLE That’s another story. But a lot of competition, but a lot of support, and then when Robert got into owning a night club Downtown… Downtown was a cool thing. “Downtown, we’re playing Downtown.” The Golden Crown. There were a lot of other opportunities and not only just for the local and regional acts, but also these guys were bringing everybody in. ROBERT NESBITT One of the other things when you are talking about these bands, especially some of the bands that are on the Wheedle’s Groove record. When one band had a record, immediately the other bands came out with a record. So the pressure and the onus were on us at the radio station to play that record, and play that record a lot. Robbie Hill is one of the great stories. Robbie Hill of Family Affair – you guys are going to be around this Friday to see him perform – Robbie Hill had a… it was like The Sopranos, he had his own little cartel quarter, he had people on the phone calling the radio station. Because the way that we judged a good record was going to be number one was by sales and requests. So sales were never going to be - we never saw sales zoom, you know, we never saw them in the triple digits, a hundred records coming out of the store - but we usually used requests. Robbie Hill would have his mother, his aunt, his cousin, his everybody calling three and four times an hour, using different disguises of their voice just to get the request in, so we can tabulate the request and bring the record to number one. But there was always this competition between the artists. The good part for me was that we - well, my partners and I, we had a nightclub. So we were playing the records on the radio, and also we could book the bands in the club. So it worked very well for us, you know [audience chuckles]? And also, we paid the bands quite well. TONY GABLE Yeah, yeah, we did. Except for all those stairs. Moving a B3, you guys know what a B3 is? [audience chuckles] ROBERT NESBITT It is a big difference. Nowadays, what do you need to perform? Nothing, you just put everything in a bag. TONY GABLE You just bring in a controller and a G4 PowerBook, and you can just plug in, and get all your pads and… ROBERT NESBITT But all these bands were, every band was different. TONY GABLE Different outfits, everybody had their own. ROBERT NESBITT Different type of music, different outfits. TOBY LAING And this was like a friendly rivalry? ROBERT NESBITT It was, everybody was supported… TOBY LAING It seems like. ROBERT NESBITT Everybody enjoyed each other. TONY GABLE But it was competition. ROBERT NESBITT Yeah, it was. TONY GABLE You wanted to be the best, you wanted to be number one. But you’d go see another band and say, “Wow, did you hear that arrangement?” ROBERT NESBITT And you would hear the same story, not only in Seattle, but you would hear the same story with bands in Atlanta, New York, Chicago. That’s how it was. TONY GABLE There was a group from Portland. ROBERT NESBITT But we were very myopic about it, because we were right here in Seattle and that was the only thing we cared about. We look back at it now, we say that, “Boy, wouldn’t it have been great if we would have gotten our records distributed, some of these records distributed around the country?” That wasn’t to be back in those days. TONY GABLE The logical thinking was, if you were so great, and you had such great original tunes, you would be (air quotes) discovered. So we kept waiting for, you know, Quincy Jones to be sitting there going to a club: [whispers] “Quincy Jones is here! OK, fork up the ’fro, you know, shine your shoes and stuff.” We just thought that was the way it was going to happen. Some of the realities that you had to leave in order to get [discovered] - well, you know, Hendrix left, went to England. But you had to go to LA, or New York or meet somebody. A couple of groups did finally meet Quincy Jones and had some opportunities as well. But we just kept making records. I think we made four singles, and we just kept recording and kept recording again. And then later, as you get a little bit older, then you realise, we gotta get an agent, or we gotta get someone that will connect us to some… There was a group that did take that advice, and they moved to Los Angeles, the group called Pleasure, and they did move from Portland down there, and then they got a big, a real record deal, with a whole album – because most of our records were 45s. Did anyone ever make an album? I don’t think so. Everybody just had 45s, we had enough material for an album [Robert Nesbitt holds up an record sleeve]. Oh, there it is. ROBERT NESBITT This is Pleasure. Look at that artwork, wow. [audience chuckles] TOBY LAING The thing about these 45s is I've heard that lately they've been changing hands for large sums of money and they have become very rare items. You know, collectors are after them. ROBERT NESBITT & TONY GABLE Pat, pat… TOBY LAING I also heard a Cold, Bold & Together 7" was going for a couple of thousand dollars or something. I heard that, I read that. TONY GABLE I got a few left. TOBY LAING Hey, wow, you know? [laughter] TONY GABLE If I knew that they were selling for that - I will have to dig some out. I didn’t know that. When my kids hear me singing, they are like, “Dad, is that you?” And they see me, I was like major less, this was in the starving artist days. So when they look at these photos, they are like, “Who’s that? Who is this guy who is looking like, you know, Kareem?” You know, because I was the tallest person, and skinny with these big ‘fros. We sang high. Well, 20, 30 years later, you hear my voice now, it’s… and I don’t even smoke cigarettes. ROBERT NESBITT What about [turns to interviewer], back to that question, maybe they might be interested in the recording process, how did that happen? How did you guys get together, where did you go? TONY GABLE Well, we went to Kaye-Smith. I mean, the first time we recorded, they were building a recording studio, and we were at a college and they said, “Hey, do you guys want to test this out?” No walls, no baffles, nothing. The cords were just running across, we tripped over the cords. We tracked it, they gave us a tape, we turned it into a 45. So, if you had any… ROBERT NESBITT Was it four-track? TONY GABLE That was “Dedication (To Our Wonderful, Beautiful Black Sisters),” a single that we… ROBERT NESBITT You recorded it four-track or… TONY GABLE I think it was, like, one-and-a-half-track, the way this studio was. ROBERT NESBITT How long did it take for you to record that? Tony Gable Well there were no overdubs. That's the other thing. When we were recording back in the day, you just went in and played, because you'd been playing these songs so much, you just went into the studio and they tracked it, and then maybe overdub later, maybe a solo, or something like that, or some vocals. No everything was live, and the group sounded like they did in person because that was it, the real deal. Then synthesizers started coming in after the B3 and the Rhodes, I mean the hallmark or the standard was a Rhodes, or Wurlitzer, and a B3, and giant amps. That's what it was. TOBY LAING So, something I think that everyone can take from this is supporting your community, actually getting and helping your fellow musicians. I think around the world it seems a lot of scenes seem to be quite separated and try to just push their own music and look after themselves, but it seems like this is an example of the radio station helping out the scene, the individual bands helping out the scene, and the people had an identity from being in these bands, you know? It seems like these bands did a lot together, not just playing music. They were together a lot travelling, working on the road, and in some cases even living in the same house, I don’t know if that’s true. TONY GABLE Oh yeah, yeah, many of us had band houses, they were notorious. I think perhaps the Seattle police visited a few, uh [smiles], in those days. In college it was the kegger days, but in band days it was a little bit different, but everybody – well, I keep saying everybody, but I mean CBT, we just call us CBT – we didn’t have day gigs, we were musicians, that was it. And many times in our experience, the lights were turned off, we didn’t pay the light bill, we’d play all week for two hundred dollars. Not two hundred dollars each, two hundred dollars total. And we used to have this little thing where, when we got paid, everybody wanted to go to the store for shopping. That was the only way you got what you wanted to eat [smiles]. Because we didn’t split up the money, it was a real commune. If the bass player needed an amp, we just took the money and bought the bass player an amp. There wasn’t, like, now the guitar player has 50 guitars. It was very communal and that’s the way we just stuck together. And people kind of aligned us with, well, “Were you guys kind of like a gang?” No, we were a band. But you protected your crew, and everybody’s band had their own crew and stuff. We did a lot of things for the community. ROBERT NESBITT Yeah. TONY GABLE We played the Black Community Festival, got to meet Melvin Van Peebles. ROBERT NESBITT And another thing is that a lot of these bands were excluded from the (air quotes) mainstream, that was one of the things too. Because of where we were socially at that time, that era, you weren’t going to get invited by the promoter who worked with KJR to come and play a gig over in West Seattle, that was not going to be happen. So if you were a soul band, you were pretty much going to play a soul club, you would play soul festivals, and that was it, then. Forget about it. No matter how great a song Cold, Bold & Together puts out - and Cold, Bold & Together had a song, which is not on Wheedle’s Groove, which is called “Our Love Song Turned Sad” - a great song, it’s a ballad. I listen to it every day, it is a great song. That record never made it to quote-unquote – [to the audience] excuse me, no more air quotes, folks, I promise, no more, OK? [audience chuckles] – it never made it to pop radio, Top 40 radio. But it was a big record here in Seattle. It actually got played down in Portland, and I think that it sold well up in Canada. But everything was fractionalised, everything was just broken down to just that one area, it really didn’t get the support from the pop audience. TONY GABLE And it was rare to have that opportunity to play in different clubs. I remember one time, going to a club way in the North End, and they thought we were moving their equipment. So they kept saying, “When is the band going to get here?” “We don’t have roadies, what are you talking about? We are the band.” “There must be a mistake. You guys can’t play here.” ROBERT NESBITT I mean, that’s how it was then. TONY GABLE I said, “What do you mean?” “I’m sorry, but we just… You can’t play.” I said, “Oh, OK, let me get this right. You didn’t see the promo picture, did you?” “No. Ah, someone did book this.” I said, “OK, alright. If you don’t want us to play, give us the check, and we’ll put our equipment back in the van and go someplace else.” And that’s what happened. They would not let us play. And this used to happen sometimes, some of the booking agents would just send you to gigs. We would play a gig in Aberdeen, which is kind of like being in the middle of Kansas. So here is this all-black band playing Kool & The Gang, Parliament, [deep voice] “Tear The Roof Off The Sucker.” And it was like, “We’re not getting out of here, we’re gonna get killed!” It was just like The Blues Brothers, there was that fence up and stuff. ROBERT NESBITT [chuckles] Chicken wire. TONY GABLE It was like, whoa. And so fortunately, TC and Jamar, they were twin brothers, played guitar and bass, they were very musical. So we basically just played this one country riff for two hours, and everybody just took solos about 50 times around. (shouts) “How y’all doing?” You know, we just kind of changed the semantics a little bit. Forget about getting paid, we just wanted to be able to get back in the van and get out of there, but actually we had a great time. You know, the people liked us, we had a good time, we threw in a couple of soul songs there that we thought they had heard of before, and it turned out okay. ROBERT NESBITT But then there are other bands, if you look at some of the other bands on Wheedle’s Groove. There were clubs, like the Golden Crown, which was our club, that played Cold, Bold & Together, Robbie Hill’s Family Affair, Black And White Affair, Hot Ice, they would play there, but then there were guys like Overton Berry. TONY GABLE Right. ROBERT NESBITT He would not play in the Golden Crown, he would play more, what would you call it… (turns to Tony Gable) TONY GABLE Well, he is more sophisticated, more of a jazz trio. ROBERT NESBITT Right, more of a trio, black tie type of affair, so he played the Trojan Horse. TONY GABLE Right, right. ROBERT NESBITT The different types of clubs at that time in Seattle were: The Golden Crown, Soul Street, the Gallery, New Chinatown, District Tavern were your funk clubs. Heritage House also played people like Arthur Prysock and those guys. But the more upscale clubs, such as the Trojan Horse and the Double Tree, [asks Tony Gable] was it called? TONY GABLE Double Tree. ROBERT NESBITT They played some of the more upscale type of artists, like Overton Berry. TONY GABLE In terms of rock groups who were playing at that time, during the same period, a group with two sisters were doing pretty well, they were coming up the ranks. They were called Heart. And so there was a lot of other music going on as well and it was getting some great airplay. They were getting some good deals and stopped for whatever reason. I don’t know, if it’s just that people didn’t know about the soul scene in Seattle. Because when you think about Seattle, if I’m in other parts of the country and say, “I live in Washington,” they automatically think I’m talking about DC. “No, no, the other one,” you know, with the log cabins and Lois & Clark, remember that? But that’s just the way it was. It’s just unfortunate that a lot of people did not get to participate outside of some of the audiences in our community. Toby Laing Did you actually experience it as it changed? As the scene changed from this period and maybe DJs started to maybe command all the salaries. What actually happened there with the thing with the live music and how ... Tony Gable I'll say this, our keyboard player, his son is a DJ. He's gigging more than we are. It's amazing. I don't know about the DJ scene. Toby Laing How did it go down with the scene, where bands are working seven days a week. I mean, over time that starts to change. Robert Nesbitt Yeah, that happened with us at our club. You're talking about from the '70s where there were bands playing all the time, to the time where pretty much the ... Tony Gable Disco. Robert Nesbitt Disco took over. Tony Gable Killed us. Robert Nesbitt Yeah it was just marketing. It was just the market. I know our club, the Golden Crown, which was right across the street over on Fourth Ave. We saw a way to make money by playing recorded music, which broke my heart, and of course it broke the heart of the bands that we played every week. Tony Gable Yes it did. Robert Nesbitt So I said, OK, we're going to pay this band $900 a week, or we're going to pay a DJ, this was back in '77, we're going to pay him $200 a night. It was just, mathematics. Tony Gable The club owners would also make a comment, “Well, we don't have to deal with your attitudes, the zig zag paper, or any of that stuff. All we have to do is get a DJ, we don't have to worry about load-ins, feeding you, fights, groupies, none of that stuff.” It was a huge change, and musicians either started doing something else, maybe some people actually get day jobs, or moved in different areas of music. I wanted to be more involved in jazz, so people became producers, writers, other things. I don't know what it is like on the scene as far as racism or prejudice, but I'm sure it has improved. Seattle is a very diverse place but racism in the northwest is not like it used to be where it's definitely in your face. If a guy is riding on a white horse, he's got a cone on his head and a sheet, clearly he doesn't like you. Whereas here, in certain areas, not only here in the northwest but, sometimes prejudice is hidden. So it's, “Hi, how ya doin’, great to see ya,” but [cuts throat] Robert Nesbitt Right now it's about money. Tony Gable It's a little different. I would prefer knowing exactly where everybody stands rather than having to guess. TOBY LAING So I guess, Robert, from your point of view as a club owner, you’ve got to see the way society goes through different cycles, what happens on the street and what happens at night with club culture and whatnot. And you must have seen some changes and some developments in your time. ROBERT NESBITT Well, I did. Like I said, I mean, it was almost like it was overnight. This is the late mid-’70s scene from ’75 until ’78. We had our club, we ran our club from ’75 until ’84. The reason why we were no longer there is that they tore it down to build a mall - so we were to stay. I guess it was everything, it was the advent of disco music, it was Saturday Night Fever, it was social, it was economical, it was everything. Everybody just wanted to change, it was all about the bright lights. We refurbished our club, we put in nice lights and everything and had a great stage, and everybody liked it, and we just had to keep things fresh. It broke our heart, that we couldn’t have the live music because at that club we played everybody from Teddy Pendergrass to Les McCann to Cold, Bold & Together, to Billy Preston. Whoever came through Seattle played that club. But next thing you know people in Vancouver were talking about, “Let’s go down to the Golden Crown, because that’s the jamming disco.” And that was like, man, we were saving a lot of money. TONY GABLE Canada was typically always open to everything. I mean, a lot of the soul groups used to go up to Canada, you didn’t have the same types of attitudes, so you could play different places - down in Gastown, in Calgary, you could play other places and stuff. I just wanted to mention, recently one of the best male R&B singers passed away, Sam Smith. This guy was… As a solo singer, there was no one bigger than him. And hopefully, when Wheedle’s Groove 2 comes out, they can get some tracks with him. I mean, he was like a combination of Luther Vandross, Al Green, just incredible. So it was a lot of - I’m saying “was”, still is a tremendous amount of talent. Now, a lot of it is DJs and rap and hip-hop, but Seattle still has a great scene. It’s just that R&B era kind of passed. But again, people went into other things. We kind of moved into fusion - as Miles Davis was shifting into Bitches Brew and getting more electric, we were experimenting with that. Some of those groups who had come to the Golden Crown - so I would go down and see Bill Summers, the Headhunters and this was all the shift. So we just started changing from playing a Kool & The Gang song to playing something original, and that’s how we got a lot of the groups now. Kenny G and a lot of people, Jeff Lorber came out and that music became popular. Grover Washington - Mister Magic was selling tons of records, unbelievable. I remember the first night, we went to go see George Benson and we were expecting to hear “White Rabbit” and some of his old great stuff… ROBERT NESBITT And he sang, he sang. TONY GABLE …And he says, “I’m going to sing.” "What? You are a guitar player, you don’t sing.” He sang, and that same year he made “This Masquerade” and I think he has done okay [laughing]. ROBERT NESBITT One of the things that amazes me - as I said, I got my first job in radio, back in Buffalo, New York, back in the late ’60s, I was 16 years old - to now, what these people are doing today just amazes me. What’s happened technically, from the ways we used to make commercials at a radio station where we had to splice tape together and it would take us an hour-and-a-half to make a 30-second commercial. Now, with the new technology… TONY GABLE ProTools. ROBERT NESBITT …And the geniuses that you guys are out there [gestures to audience], you guys are my heroes. Because we are talking about something that happened a generation ago. From the things that we did 25 years ago to what you have access to now. I don’t know anything about what you do, so now I become the student again, and that’s just amazing. As I walk around here, and I see all this stuff, I’m like, “Where am I?” This is like Star Trek, Twilight Zone to me [audience laughs / applause]. So you guys are some strong people, I’m really proud of you, and thank you for teaching me. And I will [holds his hand up] be holding my hand up asking for help. TONY GABLE See, I know the graphic design side of the Macs but not the music side. Our guitar player Glenn Lorbiecki has a studio, and he gets on there, and we’ll go to do a session. Sometimes I do radio commercials and stuff and I just play one pass - “OK, thanks, Tony.” [looks at his watch] What are you talking about? There’s two or three more minutes, I gotta play the chords again.” “No, we got it.” I did a session with Microsoft, same thing. “We need this timbale part.” [imitates timbale] “Pababap, OK.” I’m waiting for the rest of the song. “We got it, thank you. We’ll take care of it in ProTools.” Or sing one pass around on the chorus, do it in ProTools [shrugs his shoulders]. That’s cool, but as far as musicianship, it’s better if you can actually sing all the parts. And I won’t mention the artist’s name, but she is a judge on a television show… ROBERT NESBITT Paula? TONY GABLE Oh, I didn’t say that. But there is a difference between Aretha Franklin and some of the artists you could - I’m not going to say the blonde lady’s name that just had a kid or anything [audience chuckles] - but you should be able to sing a whole song, from a musician’s standpoint. Rather than, when the technology starts to change, you’d sing a phrase, and then go back and grab a couple of sentences, and next thing you know… Now it’s all digital. But before you had have a whole truckful of two-inch tape of one song, that people were editing and splicing with the razorblade, and cutting and splicing, to get a seamless part. If you are playing jazz, you are going to be playing that live anyway. Some of the pop stuff, I don’t know. But that’s just me. But the technology is cool. I mean, because you can edit so much faster, and you can try different ideas and just lay it down and do some overdubs - “OK, that’s a groove,” and go on to the next thing. So, that would have been nice, like you were talking about effects - we used to sing a Dramatics song called “In The Rain.” We had a Shure Vocal Master, which was the standard back in the early days. We used to lift it up and drop it to make thunder. The reverb chamber would go [imitates thunder] and then we started singing the song. “Oh, that must be the [air quotes] special effects for this particular song.” So it would be whatever you could do. Now you got the synthesizers and everything. ROBERT NESBITT I don’t know if you guys realize how much power you have in how you use this monster called technology. How much power you have to influence everybody in the world. OK, say for instance, if I had a microphone and a radio station, I’m able to talk to, in a quarter hour, maybe on a lucky day, 20,000 people. But you do the technology, the internet, mass communication… TONY GABLE Podcasting. ROBERT NESBITT Podcasting, blogging. Being that you guys are those geniuses, you just have so much opportunity to do so much good, that we wish that we could have done just from the bandstand. That’s what I think. We had small radio stations, we had a bandstand, we were out there spreading goodwill. That’s what we were doing. But now, by using this monster - this great, gargantuan, mighty Joe Young of a monster of technology - you are able to do these things. And it still just blows me away when I just realize how much you have at your disposal. TONY GABLE But can I… ROBERT NESBITT [speaking over Tony Gable] And how much good you’re going to do. I’m sorry, I’m just blown away, I’m sorry. TONY GABLE Can I come in on the dark side of this monster? My kids come to me ... Robert Nesbitt Oh, that dark side. Tony Gable They start saying ... they want to download this, they want to download that. I say, “OK, let me explain something.” By the way, I'm a member of NARAS, Pacific Northwest Chapter of NARAS, you know, the recording academy. Robert Nesbitt That's the government ... Tony Gable So I'm not real big on downloading. Couple times, people would come to me and say, “Man I love that Camono Island.” I’d say, “Oh that's great you got that off the first album?” “No I downloaded it.” Oh, thank you. My kids wanted to download and their friends were burning and all this stuff. I said, “The next time you ask me for that new bike, or that new pair of Jordan's, I don't have the money for that because your friends are downloading and taking this music from other artists without paying for it.” I mean if the artist chooses to give you the music, that's fine, or if it's promotional and stuff. I'm not big on... that's why I was happy to see iTunes come out. Part of the problem that happened with this downloading issue is that, the record industry, or the music industry, didn't keep in step with technology. When this technology started to change, and they should have just been right there rather than, you know. Now it's very difficult to preach to some of the young kids about downloading and, you know, taking stuff off the internet because that's what they grew up with, you know. Oh yeah, “I bought a 100 pack of CDs and I'm gonna party.” What about the artist? So that's why it's good, iTunes and some of these other ... you know, the problem was, it was technical, there was no vehicle for you to pay, so when they used to burn something, I used to tell them, “OK I want you to put $2.00 in this envelope and send it to the musician.” You know, if you download this I want you to send it not to the manager, or the record company, send it to the writer or the artist. They got tired of doing that, so then, you know I had to buy them iPods and Apple cards, so. Which is cool with me. That's the dark side. TOBY LAING Every generation just seems to get creative with whatever they’ve got at their disposal, you know? ROBERT NESBITT Yeah, that’s just the case. TOBY LAING I think you are right about the musicianship element perhaps lacking a little bit nowadays. Not to say that it can’t come back again. But I mean, just the energy of working in a band, that’s something where you are collaborating with a group of people, and they are all bringing energy to the stage, and it’s something that, that type of music on the Wheedle’s Groove CD, it’s just got that energy coming out of the speakers that sounds like a great group effort. And I’m just interested to know when this band scene kind of started to maybe just change into something else and bands weren’t working so much. People were going off and maybe starting other careers. I’m interested in what you guys got up to after that period, when your club closed and all that. ROBERT NESBITT When I left KYAC, it was just such a blur. Because I left KYAC in the mid-’70s, and one of the natural progressions for DJs was to go to work for a record company. So what I did, I went to work for ABC Records, which was a distributor here in Seattle, we had a lot of different labels. Subsequently, from ABC I went to work for Motown Records. I did promotion for Motown. I loved Motown, I hated the label. It was just the most corrupt company I have ever worked for. But I enjoyed the artists, I worked with Stevie Wonder, I worked with Marvin Gaye, I travelled and worked with these guys. I worked for them for about two years. After that I made a transition and went to work for Chrysalis Records for 19 years. So at Chrysalis, I did promotion and marketing for them for the West Coast. My market was from Alaska down to LA and east to Denver. And the great thing about Chrysalis, which was just a wonderful experience, was that Chrysalis was a real boutique-type label. At Chrysalis you did just about everything. You were A&R, you were promotion, you were marketing, you were tour manager, you were babysitter, you were everything. And, when I went to work for Chrysalis, there were just a couple of artists on that label - Leo Sayer, Jethro Tull, pretty much. But I came in, they signed Blondie, they signed Billy Idol, they signed Huey Lewis, they signed Pat Benatar, they signed Billy Idol - did I say Billy Idol already? But this was just really a great experience, because it was totally hands-on. So I stayed with them for about 19 years and it was great, I had the best time. I got a chance to travel, I still maintain my relationship with these artists, with Huey and Pat Benatar and what have you. But the other thing that I was doing at the same time, I maintained a relationship with Tony [gestures to Tony Gable]. Tony has been my great friend for over 30 years. Cold, Bold & Together was, when they played my house, the house I still live in, was the band house, and Kenny G, who was always there, the first band member there, and the last one to leave – [to Tony Gable] I think Kenny still has a key to my house, OK? So that’s how tight I have been with these guys. TONY GABLE You didn’t mention the fact that Bobby was the first DJ in the United States to play a song by AWB [Average White Band] called “Pick Up The Pieces.” ROBERT NESBITT Oh yeah. [pulls out a record] Have to have that. TONY GABLE So not only was he breaking acts regionally because KYAC for some reason had a reputation far around the globe, people would start sending songs to KYAC, see if that would be a place to break something. ROBERT NESBITT Yeah, that was kind of cool, too, that they would do that. No one was really paying attention to any stations, any soul stations on AM. Our AM station was 1460 and you could barely hear it. And then we had an FM station, which was 96.5, and it was a low power station, like 19,000 watts, whatever it was. But what we did, we went out there, really marketed this radio station. We reported to the Gavin Report, we would send our playlist to Billboard, we would let them know what was happening. We took chances on bands, we played ... we were the first station to play Abandoned Luncheonette by Hall & Oates, that album, and their first single was “She's Gone.” Then of course we played the first album by Average White Band. We were breaking record left and right, we were one of the first R&B stations that played “Benny and the Jets” so it was kind of like a cool thing. Next thing you know, managers and record companies are coming after us and really trying to get us to play records, and we really supported the good music. Tony Gable Yeah. With me being a graphic designer, we played in CBT and then things started changing. People were trying to go in different directions and, so I just ... I worked for Boeing, gained 70 pounds there, because it was the first time I ever had a paycheck. As a starving musician or artist, you're not getting a regular check. So it was like, “Whoa.” “Settle down kid you're gonna get another one in two weeks.” I was like, “What?” So you know me and the colonel and Southern Comfort became friends and Kool-Aid and the King and ... few friends of mine. I just kept doing my graphic design thing and finally I decided to start my own studio and I've had the opportunity to travel around the world and speak in Tokyo and Chicago and around, and design as well as being as a musician. So if I go to Tokyo ... when we were ... when I was on tour with Kenny I would say, “If you want a free ticket to come see Kenny G, I get to come visit your studio.” So that's how I got to meet a lot of famous and well know graphic designers. If I had a laptop or PowerBook then I would still be on the road, because then I would be on the tour bus, I'd do my work, do my sketches, and the next hotel then I'd FedEx it back to my studio in Seattle. They would comp it up and fax it to the next gig that we'd play, and then I'd look at it and now ... it would just be amazing having the technology. I mean we had a 4-track, a recording Tascam cassette recorder in the back of the tour bus and stuff. Kenny went off to go play sax with Jeff Lorber, the other band members started playing in other groups, writing songs, becoming television producers. We all stayed in media, and you know the creative services, and then when I was doing my studio I left Boeing for creativity because that's what I wanted to do in my heart. Then Kenny called me one day and played me this song ... it's kinda sing songie, I guess I don't know anything because it came #5 in the country, it's called “Songbird.” Because as a percussionist I want things to drive and funk. By the way I'm glad that a lot of groups that we idolized ... I took my nine-year-old son to see Santana a couple weeks ago, so the guy who started it he is bigger than ever. If you would have told me during the period of the CBT era, that this geeky guy playing the sax was gonna sell more records than Grover Washington, Ronnie Laws, Pearl Jam, I would have said “What are you smoking? There's no way.” We should make him sing “Play That Funky Music White Boy” with Wild Cherry. We'd just make him sing it, he couldn't sing that good but he could play the sax. He called one day and said, “Hey I think ‘Songbird’ is going to do okay, do you want to come on tour?” Well to support my design studio at the time, a laser writer cost $5,000. OK. That was kind of expensive so by going on tour with him not only did I get a chance to see a lot of other graphic design studios but get to hear and hang out with musicians. Miles Davis, I mean, Chick Corea, all kind of festivals. You know from playing in a tavern with four people with a Shure Vocal Master to playing at Carnegie Hall, sold out show, with one of my friends that was in the band. That was just extraordinary. A lot of people in this band went on to play with the Dazz Band, like I said Maze, Ashford & Simpson, so very strong musicianship not only from this group but other groups in Seattle. A lot of the groups' on Wheedle's Groove. People are still gigging, still playing, it's our life, it's our love, being creative and stuff. Kenny's doing okay, he's playing a lot golf. So, that opportunity to travel. Meeting Grover, you know, getting to hang out with these guys being back stage, talking to them, how do they make songs that kind of create ... creative, ah, it was just extraordinary. So it's still continuing to do graphic design and music. The group now that we work with, it's called 206 because most of the writers and musicians are from Seattle. So that's what we continue to do, we've had some success in that as well, so that's what we'll continue to do. TOBY LAING You know, to the outsider it looks like, “Ah, there was this amazing music, and it kind of just went away, and then it’s coming back again.” But really it didn’t, it just turned into something else, it just kept on, and a lot of these guys are still playing. But I mean, this label, this local Seattle label Light In The Attic, this guy Matt Sullivan who runs that label – for him he came to the music, even though he is from Seattle, he came to the music by getting a 7" or a little single he didn’t know. He couldn’t believe it was from Seattle, he didn’t know about the music. And these people who are from Seattle, who are thinking, “I’ve discovered the lost music scene,” it’s funny - they weren’t there actually to witness it for themselves, and couldn’t see it just develop into something else. But it’s interesting that this next generation with all the internet and all the computers and whatnot are sort of now discovering it and enjoying it. And the music is actually travelling, it’s travelling around the world. I mean, I heard the CD in Wellington in New Zealand and I know it’s going well all around the world. And I just want to know what you think about that. ROBERT NESBITT I think one of the great things about this record is that some of these artists, who’ve fallen on some hard times economically, socially, have been rejuvenated by this. I’m seeing guys like Ronnie Buford - there are quite a few artists here who have really, really been down on their luck. But this is a chance for them to revive a career, they get out there to do the things that they did so well a long time ago. Yeah, they maybe a little long in that, too, but any time you can boost someone’s spirit, anything that would be a catalyst to help boost your spirits, I think it’s a good thing. And hopefully they’ll make some money, hopefully people will go out and buy this, hopefully you’ll talk about this when you go back home, hopefully you will never forget this. And even maybe there’ll be a part two to this to really get those artists back on their feet again. That’s one of the things that I was really excited about. How I became involved in this, Tony had spoken with Matt, because Matt wanted Tony’s music from Cold, Bold & Together. And Matt at the time was having such a hard time getting in touch with some of these artists because they were like, “Who is this guy, who is this Matt dude?” You know? “Get away from me. Shoo, get away.” So Matt asked me to sit down and talk to him, I really believed in what he was doing, and I just thought it was a no-brainer for these artists who had this music that just sat dormant in their basements somewhere doing nothing - you might as well put it out there and let people get a chance to hear it. So I acted as an emissary, and I went out and got some of these people to sign on, and next thing you know we got about six or seven of the artists who had not made any commitment to this project, and they came about and there we are. TONY GABLE It was a great opportunity. When I spoke to Matt, a lot of us had thought about doing this. But you are so focused on what you are doing, it takes somebody, an outsider, to kind of come in and recognise something that was really great and wonderful, and then put it together. And so that was really cool. I know he has a team of people that he’s worked with at Light In The Attic and stuff, and when he first started talking about it, I was like, [sceptically] “OK, is this really going to happen?” “No,” he said. “I’m serious, I really want to find these artists and make this happen.” And I saw it as an opportunity to document this era that was really not discovered, and really… ROBERT NESBITT No one had told this story. The story had not been recorded. People knew about it, it was here and there, but there was never really a piece [holds up the CD]. TONY GABLE And you hear about Seattle, Jackson Street, the jazz era that was here. You hear about Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, those guys were just tremendous. We actually had the opportunity to open for Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx in 206 and that was kind of cool, seeing the movie Ray. So this was a great opportunity to kind of go back and grab this whole era, and then put it out there for people to hear it. Because when people hear it, they are like, “Wow, I don’t remember this.” Well, maybe you were on the other side of the town. Or you didn’t get into the club where we were playing, or you didn’t go here and stuff. It was very vibrant, and everybody that hears a record from that era, they remember such good times. It’s no different than if you put on an old “My Girl” by The Temptations, you start [snaps] - oh yeah, I remember this and that and you just get your groove on. The same thing with this music as well. Robert Nesbitt It really makes me feel good and I'm quite surprised, and I don't know why I'm surprised but when I hear you say like, “Wow I just heard this record and I was just blown away.” I used to play these records 80 times a day. I got so sick and tired of hearing them, even though they were great songs. When they went away they were like, fine that's just an old ... but to see a generation later, these songs come back and be relived as they are is, you know, “Wow what attracted you to that?” What did attract you to that? Something that you had not heard or? Toby Laing I mean obviously I do a bit of DJing in Wellington, just in bars playing old song music. Stuff that I pick up from the thrift shop for $1, stuff like that. I kind of collect a lot of records, then I start looking at more of the compilations that are coming out. Digging up a bit rarer, you know you don't get a lot of rare records down in New Zealand, but a lot of stuff gets reissued and a lot of compilations start to come out. I started to come across this compilation, and you know, in that way. Yeah, I mean, those songs have an effect on the dancefloor down there. Tony Gable Really? Wow. Robert Nesbitt That's just amazing. Tony Gable That's great. Robert Nesbitt Everything that's old is new. TOBY LAING Robbie Hill’s Family Affair's “I Just Want To Be (Like Myself),” I first found it on a French compilation, I think, from a few years ago. So that song was definitely coming out somewhere. That song did get to #1 in Seattle, didn’t it, for a little while? ROBERT NESBITT Yeah, it was. TOBY LAING Yeah. And I think, it was in the heat of James Brown and in the heat of the O’Jays and all that, so he’s got a good achievement there. But that was the song that really stuck out for me on that particular French compilation, so it was great to see it on the album there. ROBERT NESBITT I think pretty much this is just the tip of the iceberg. I am sure that all these artists - I mean, there are so many other bands that have not been compiled on Wheedle’s Groove. TONY GABLE Or anywhere. This is the beginning of revisiting and rediscovering this very viable and vibrant community of musicians and hopefully it will just continue on. ROBERT NESBITT Yeah, we had spoken with Matt about that, and you could just put so much music on the first release, but there will be more coming out. TOBY LAING Well, I want to thank you very much. ROBERT NESBITT Are there any questions before we…? TOBY LAING Oh, yeah. TONY GABLE I mean we are just… soul survivors. ROBERT NESBITT We were just, “Blahblahblahblah.” TONY GABLE Anybody have any…? ROBERT NESBITT Questions? AUDIENCE MEMBER I have two questions. The first question was kind of in the comparison between what was going on here versus what was going on in Detroit. And with Motown Records there were a lot of studio players, studio drummers, studio bass players that were playing on all the tracks, but here it wasn’t really like that. You had all the bands quite separately, and the bass player was playing bass for this band and not the other one. How was it? Did the people mix and mingle a bit, or was it really this bit-competitive atmosphere like you said where people were really… ROBERT NESBITT I would say that Motown, that’s like the home office. It’s like, Motown’s here, everywhere else was just totally different. [to Tony Gable] The Funk Brothers… TONY GABLE Yeah, the Funk Brothers and that movie, I think it was called Behind The Shadows… ROBERT NESBITT & AUDIENCE MEMBER Standing In The Shadows Of Motown. TONY GABLE Standing In The Shadows, and those were tremendous musicians and they were jazz players, but they were backing all of the tracks for all of these vocal artists. That’s why the Beatles had a big impact on me when I first saw them on Ed Sullivan, despite that my mum wanted them to get a haircut. That was the first time I saw a band playing and singing. And that was what kind of attracted me to the British Invasion, because most of the groups, the soul groups, there’d be - you know, Otis Redding would be out front, and then there’d be a band. But the band was kind of back here [gestures behind his back] and the single artist or the solo artist was out front. Whereas with most of the groups in Seattle that happened sometimes, but then there was kind of a change or it was more integrated. And part of it came about because of Sly and Earth, Wind & Fire, where there was more than one vocalist. There were two vocalists or three vocalists, and the band was an integral part, they were not the back-up band. They could be interchanged, people came not only to see the singer with us, or Keith Hooks, or different people in the band, but also for the bass player, it was just part of the personality. So I actually don’t remember any time with us ever recording on somebody else’s tracks. ROBERT NESBITT Right, exactly. If you were with Cold, Bold & Together, you were with Cold, Bold & Together. TONY GABLE That’s your crew. ROBERT NESBITT If you were with Black And White Affair, Manuel Stan did not come and play bass on a Cold, Bold & Together song. It was just… TONY GABLE Nah, that’s turf [chuckles]. I mean, it would have probably been okay, but I don’t think we really thought [about it]. ROBERT NESBITT [shakes head] I never saw that happen. TONY GABLE We did gigs together. Like we, CBT, we played for the Free Breakfast Program for the [Black] Panthers, because they were trying to feed kids in the morning to go to school. So there was a lot of community activity playing for people, so there would be times when we were all on the same show, but we were on different teams. ROBERT NESBITT It was a turf competition thing. Now, everybody plays on everybody else’s records here and now. TONY GABLE Yeah, I’d get Bernadette [Bascom] to come over and help on a song. You see what I mean? I don’t know if that’s because of maturing, and you got a little bit older, but at that time it was like, “Hey, we are on the Raiders, we are on this.” There were no Seahawks in those days, you know? We were on the Raiders. ROBERT NESBITT I don’t think there was any performance of sophistication back in that day, you know, because you didn’t see how great that would be for a person like Bernadette Bascom to go and sing background vocals on another artist’s record. Whereas Robbie Hill would say, like, “Oh no, that can’t happen.” Because they just didn’t have that, we just didn’t know how to do that. We didn’t know how to process that. TONY GABLE And it was even rare for people to change bands. ROBERT NESBITT Oh, yeah. TONY GABLE You know, maybe a lead singer might… ROBERT NESBITT Oh, that was very rare. TONY GABLE But that was just very rare. I mean, you were with that band until you died - and actually that did happen, unfortunately. Or you went to jail (chuckles), you know? ROBERT NESBITT And you know, another thing, Seattle was way up here, OK? We were so far away from everybody that it was just hard to… You really didn’t get the influences that, say, if you were a band in the Bay Area. In the Bay Area you may have some bleed over from the influence of LA, OK? In Detroit you may get some influence from Chicago. In Philly there were some New York influences. In Seattle we were just here. And that’s the thing that really amazes me about how well and how strong the Seattle music scene was. Because there wasn’t a lot of influence, unless someone moved from Kansas City to Seattle or what have you. AUDIENCE MEMBER OK, thanks. That answers my question. And the second thing, when you played this first track earlier, we were kind of making a joke that everyone in the room was going to be swooping in to see what that first loop is and to load it into their MPC. And I was wondering if you guys know, I guess you know about kind of the way a lot of people are making music these days. Like digging through the stacks for this one track, for this one bass groove, for this one trumpet line and what your reaction is to that kind of music? How you feel about it, have you heard it, what’s up with that? TONY GABLE I think it’s up to the artist. It is funny now, now that we’re grown-ups, we are hearing commercials with the Rolling Stones’ song, or you hear a Chevy commercial and there’s a song that was like an anthem for change in the world and now it’s behind the Kleenex commercial. It’s just different. The commercialization, the global… I think a lot of artists would just say, “OK, don’t forget to send me a cheque.” But some artists may say, “No, this goes with this sound, and it’s not going to be separated.” But I was glad to see that hip-hop artists and rap artists started paying for stuff, like Hammer. ROBERT NESBITT “U Can’t Touch This.” TONY GABLE Yeah, I mean, to us that was Rick James. ROBERT NESBITT Right. TONY GABLE It was like, [quizzically] Hammer? You know, my kids’ll hear a song. “Have you ever heard of this group?” And I’m like [head in hands], “Oh God.” You know? Or like [to Robert Nesbitt] George Lopez’s TV show starts off with a War song. ROBERT NESBITT Oh yeah, “Low Rider.” TONY GABLE Yeah, “Low Rider.” And the kids are like, “Hey do you like that song?” [scratches forehead] “I played that song five million times.” You know, so it’s just different. But, I don’t know, I would hope that who you are taking or sampling the music from would have some input, because they may not like what you’re going to do to it. And they should have that right to say, “I don’t want that.” And other people are going to say, [shrugs] “Just send me a cheque.” So it just depends on who the artist is. But I’d be open to it. ROBERT NESBITT I’m like, as long as it is good and creative, have fun with it. TONY GABLE Yeah. ROBERT NESBITT You know, come on! [shrugs] Great, you know? If you can come up with something from Beethoven’s 9th Symphony and bust that open, do it! So as long as - if you feel good about it, we have respect for the music. Have fun with it. TONY GABLE Yeah, there’s a lot of grooves, there’s so much music - not just here, but in Ohio, in the South, Atlanta, there’s all kind of groups that did not make it to the big stage that have tremendous amounts of vaults, of grooves and beats and stuff. So there’s an untapped resource of things that could be combined with modern technology that could be successful. AUDIENCE MEMBER I guess - I’m sorry, I’m just in the back here - I guess, for us, speaking for people in this room that make hip-hop music or produce using samples, a lot of these people would be effectively taking the open drums at the start of that track we listened to, and looping that up basically, you know what I mean? I think you mentioned Ballin’ Jack earlier on? ROBERT NESBITT & TONY GABLE Yeah, right. Ballin’ Jack. AUDIENCE MEMBER A group from around here? TONY GABLE Yeah. AUDIENCE MEMBER OK, Ballin’ Jack, two of their records, they’ve got drum breaks on them. And that’s the only one reason I know the name of that group. So I guess, we’re just really interested to see if you guys would be annoyed if we were looping up bits of your records, really. ROBERT NESBITT Oh, I don’t see anybody who would be annoyed by that. TONY GABLE [shrugging] Again, I think it just depends on the artist. I mean, that song started off with - the drummer was Harry Alexander. He had what we called a funk foot. A lot of great drummers, musicians, we were experimenting as well because the technology with the instrumentation was changing. Everybody wanted to be Hendrix. “How can we get the sound out of this box and stuff?” So I guess it just depends on the artists or something that you are listening to, if you would just indicate your interests, “Hey, I like that beat, could I use that?” AUDIENCE MEMBER So it’s a question of asking for permission always? Because traditionally in hip-hop that hasn’t been the case, really. I mean, open drums, in the court of law it doesn’t really constitute music until very recently, you know? TONY GABLE See, have you ever heard “Brick House”? OK, that signature at the beginning of “Brick House,” to me that’s a copy of… I mean, I am not an attorney, but [beatboxes a drumroll] I mean, if I hear that, I know that that’s “Brick House,” just like if somebody was singing it. So if I heard that on a hip-hop song, I would hope that you would contact the Commodores, you know [audience member nods and smiles]? ROBERT NESBITT Maybe I’m so naive that I’m thinking that hopefully it would be a professional given. I am just hoping that’s what it would be as a respect to the artist or the originator of the music. TONY GABLE Right. TOBY LAING It’s sort of like what Harvey was saying the other day. If you use a piece of someone else’s music, it is all good until you start making a lot of money off it. And it’s kind of like, you’ve got to make sure that you let them know if it blows up. AUDIENCE MEMBER I mean, because traditionally in hip-hop the whole part of the ethos is really to find the most obscure sample, the most obscure drum break, that no one else has got… ROBERT NESBITT Right. AUDIENCE MEMBER …And thus by not clearing it protect that sound, thus a DJ or a producer is then associated with that drum sound forever, and no one else can find where he got it from, so I am just really interested to see what you guys make of all of that. TONY GABLE If we were back in the day [Robert laughs], everybody was very protective of whatever they did. I mean, like this drummer - literally, if you tried to take his beat, he’d show up at your house with a shotgun [audience laughs]. So again, like I said, everybody were crews, we had instruments - well, we did have weapons. But it’s different now. Again, Bobby was alluding to the courtesy, I guess it’s courtesy. And I don’t know if that’s proper in hip-hop, but at some point if you start hearing it on the radio and you start seeing it on Billboard - hmm, [scratches chin] you’d probablyhear from somebody’s attorney at one point. ROBERT NESBITT It’s an infringement. TONY GABLE But it’ll be interesting to see how… I actually had an opportunity this year for the first time. I was in Chicago at a roof party, and there had to be percussion, but there was no percussionist. But there was a DJ. And they were just inviting people to come up and play, and I started playing and said, “This is kind of fun.” Because I get on the dancefloor and [does hand dance] shake my groove thing [audience laughs, Robert Nesbitt grooves]. And then I saw the percussion and I got up there, started playing. “You could play?” “Uh, yeah.” And I just started having fun with the beats and stuff and it was kind of cool, because, hey, I can take a break, get a drink, the beat’s still going on, come back up there, play congas [laughter], you know, I can do it! So it was actually kind of fun. ROBERT NESBITT See, this is a conversation that - I’ve never had this conversation. We wouldn’t have this conversation, what, 30 years ago? I don’t remember there being any infringement issues about a long time ago because whatever came out from Cold, Bold & Together was Cold, Bold & Together. Nobody ever came back from Atlanta and said, “Hey, “Love Song Turned Sad,” we’ve got a song that’s just like that.” So, but that’s an interesting question. AUDIENCE MEMBER I guess it’s just kind of like, if you think of how many funk tunes basically rip off the groove from “Cold Sweat”, you know? ROBERT NESBITT & TONY GABLE Oh! Oh! Oh! AUDIENCE MEMBER How many late ’60s, early ’70s tunes are there? TONY GABLE Well, James Brown started getting paid for that. He was getting royalty checks. ROBERT NESBITT James Brown, he just, he went after every one of the… TONY GABLE Because I used to hear like a hip-hop song or something, and I did say, “That’s James Brown,” but at some point, I guess they had to start… AUDIENCE MEMBER I mean, even the first time around funk groups would hear James Brown and be like, “We need to make a group that sounds like this,” you know [both agree]? So I am just wondering if this is a modern-day phenomenon of that. And I mean, what made you guys want to make a specific kind of music? Was it hearing someone like James Brown and really wanting to imitate that style? ROBERT NESBITT I think it was more genre-related. TONY GABLE Yeah, genre-related. ROBERT NESBITT It was more genre-related than to sound like somebody else. I think you wanted to find something that was within that ballpark, “Hey, that’s a hit record, that’s a hit sound.” Going back to Motown, you got the Supremes and also you have the Marvelettes, they were both girl groups. They were a little bit different, but they were still pretty much in the same genre, and they were still soulful acts or whatever. So, if you had Cold, Bold & Together – speaking of Tony’s band – I know what the genesis of this band was from a standpoint of where they wanted to - their parameters, or where they wanted to put themselves into. Because you guys were really a dance-oriented band, a funk and Latin-type thing that still had some overtures to maybe some Kool & The Gang, maybe some Earth, Wind & Fire, but a lot of different things. TONY GABLE But at some point as a musician, you do listen to other artists, and you do learn their chops or you try to get to that point because then you kind of mature as an artist. At first you can’t play like that and then, “Oh I can do that.” But then the next question is, “Now can I think of something just as good?” And then, we weren’t Earth, Wind & Fire, we weren’t Kool & The Gang, so, “Who are we?” And then as artists and musicians you started to kind of look inside, we didn’t wanted to sound like that group over there, so everybody has a very distinct, different sound. Even if we all maybe would share the same instrumentation, the sound was different. And a lot of that was just on purpose. You know, “We don’t want to sound like that.” Most of the time in a vocal group, in a band, there’ll be a first tenor, the Philip Bailey guy, and then there’d be a baritone, so that kind of structure was there - but what are we going to sing about? What are we going to play music about? And just listening to this arrangement, I was like, “Oh my God, we didn’t even start the verse for 45 seconds.” That would never happen, and we’d have songs that were ten minutes long. See, that was back in the FM era, album music, when people would just play a song for 15, 20 minutes. Now it’s like [snaps fingers], “OK, where’s the hook? OK, here’s the verse, hit it, come around. OK baby, go to the B-section, come around…” I’m talking about commercial pop music with hits. It’s too much structure. ROBERT NESBITT [points to the audience member] Are you a producer? AUDIENCE MEMBER Uh, can I plead guilty [chuckles]? ROBERT NESBITT Sure! OK, so this is what I am saying. I take that you asked that question, I kind of figured that you might be a producer. So what is it what you are looking for? You got an artist, you are going to find out where you are going to take this artist. That’s your job as a producer, right? AUDIENCE MEMBER Er, not really [chuckles]. ROBERT NESBITT OK, what is your process? AUDIENCE MEMBER Nowadays, I mean I guess I’m kind of a thief really, and there is another culprit in this room who works with me, and we take… [Robert laughs] I mean, it’s going to be pretty hard to explain it to Deodato in a couple of weeks’ time, but basically we take chunks out of people’s music and glue it back together with a lot of post-production and re-editing. ROBERT NESBITT Really? AUDIENCE MEMBER To get layers upon layers of sound going. ROBERT NESBITT We did that… AUDIENCE MEMBER It takes a really long time. ROBERT NESBITT It would cost us a million dollars to try to do that, because technically we just couldn’t do that, [to Tony Gable] could we? We couldn’t go and take snippets of different things, it would just cost us too much. AUDIENCE MEMBER With this particular drum break that we were talking about, if you just gave that first five seconds to everybody in this room, every person would come back to you with something different. TONY GABLE That’s cool, yeah. AUDIENCE MEMBER I mean, it’s not taking that and just looping it for ten minutes and that’s it. Everyone’s going to fuck with it a bit, chop it, move it around. So it’s a bit different. It’s not so much just taking something, it’s like learning a tune to play, and then, like you were saying it, learning some little run from it that’s nice, throwing it into some of your own stuff later on, and then developing it and finding something else that goes with it. It’s the same kind of thing. We take that, twist it, do something else with it and then throw it back, you know what I mean? It’s the same thing, just… TONY GABLE Sure, sure. AUDIENCE MEMBER It’s the way that we do it, instead of the way that you would have done it initially. ROBERT NESBITT So would this be masked pretty much, I mean, you would pretty much take that basic… AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah, you might not even recognize it in the end. It might be pitched down, pitched up, chopped, rearranged. It’s just that kind of stuff just has a nice sound. I’d have loved to have a drum kit in my apartment, but I can’t, you know what I mean? So for me that kind of stuff - I’ll play the rest of the stuff in, but I’ll take that and chop it and give myself a nice drum groove to play the rest of my stuff over. So it’s respectful, it’s not so much snatching it and making money off it. It goes back to the people. TONY GABLE Well, it’s creativity on a different level. You know, you guys will be doing different things that we would not think of. Not only the technical aspect, but also just the way of thinking. You know, it’s just like arrangements - A-section and B-section, chorus. So it’s going to be like that [for us], while you’re thinking, “Can I take this and put this over here, then loop this? And oh! When it sounds cool at the end, it’s cool.” ROBERT NESBITT Would you say that that little section would plant a seed within your head, that you would just totally make hybrids [audience member nods] and you would just totally grow from that, to the point where the originator of those beats wouldn’t be able to tell the difference? AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah. ROBERT NESBITT Then it’s fair game. AUDIENCE MEMBER I guess that you can use a sample in a good way and use it in a bad way. Probably what you guys think of as samples is just like taking the main theme from a track and looping it up. ROBERT NESBITT & TONY GABLE Oh yeah, yeah. AUDIENCE MEMBER And that’s to me just a bad way of using samples. ROBERT NESBITT Right. AUDIENCE MEMBER But there are loads of different ways to work with them. So, well, that’s it [chuckles]. TONY GABLE Well, in relationship to graphic design, I mean, OK, you are taking circles and squares and stuff with different technology and Photoshop and doing this - things are just changing and then you actually create a hybrid or something new, and it exists on its own. AUDIENCE MEMBER You do a collage. TONY GABLE Yeah. AUDIENCE MEMBER Like with images from magazines or whatever. TONY GABLE Right. AUDIENCE MEMBER It’s the same thing but with music. It’s like a collage. ROBERT NESBITT Collage, yeah. AUDIENCE MEMBER Taking things and changing the context and doing something new. ROBERT NESBITT Once again, I just think that if you are going to do something that’s so obvious, the acknowledgement aspect of it comes into play, I would say. TONY GABLE What I’m hearing them saying is, it wouldn’t be like eight bars straight… ROBERT NESBITT Oh yeah, right. TONY GABLE …or 16 bars like what Hammer did, clearly that’s Rick James’s song [audience laughs]. ROBERT NESBITT Well, yeah. TONY GABLE You know, this is James Brown screaming for 16 bars, or something like that. There are just a couple of flams here, a hi-hat here, and then you’ve ended up mixing it with something else, and then you put a bassline, I guess, or, I don’t know [throws hands in air]. I have never done that before. AUDIENCE MEMBER Once again, first of all, before I am a sampling artist, first of all I am a record collector. Why? Because I just love this era, let’s say from ’68 to ’73. ROBERT NESBITT Wow. AUDIENCE MEMBER And that’s because the recordings that were made in this period with certain engineering, it’s like you used to record on some stuff that is just impossible to find today. So for somebody like me, well, I can’t play any instrument, but if I could, I couldn’t even record with the same warmth you guys had because it’s just not the same thing. So that’s why I somehow turned to sampling because when I sample, I just get that sound I am looking for. It is really warm and friendly and everything. And the reason why I am doing samples is also because to show love to that era and incite people to listen to these records, because to me it’s just the greatest music ever. It’s just the best era. TONY GABLE Well, with individual artists, that is going to be happen. I mean, sometimes people think Picasso kind of created and developed that look that he’s famous for. If you ever go to Africa, you will see a lot of that. So influences happen to everybody and that’s just natural. And then hopefully you’ll find your own voice, and then be able to do that. But everything was warmer because everything was analog. We were dealing with tapes and, by the way, digging out the tapes for this [holds up the Wheedle’s Groove CD] was quite a challenge. [looks up pensively] “OK, is that under the dog’s bed [audience laughs], in the basement, where is that reel at?” And then I had to take it to a Fast Tracks, and luckily they helped me to get some of the tracks back. Because we made those songs and if you didn’t get a hit record, well, OK, that’s kind of gone, and now I’m a plumber. And then somebody says, “Hey, do you still have this tape?” And luckily we did, most of us did put out records. So we had a lot of 45s left, and then Matt could either clean them up, or if you could find original tracks - but even though we have 2" tapes and stuff, you have to find an analog 24-track recorder. A lot of things are now in digital or ProTools, or the board is about this big [shows a small size] and you got a big 30" [shows a big size] widescreen Mac monitor, and [types in the air] and so on. That was cool. AUDIENCE MEMBER One thing I would like to [comment] about what you just said. I’m just quoting the introduction from a friend of mine’s album. It’s actually a sample that I found and some guy is saying, “If you copy from one guy, then it’s plagiarism, but if you copy from several guys, then it’s research.” And I consider my work research. [Robert and Tony laugh / audience applauds] ROBERT NESBITT Amen to that. TONY GABLE Well this has been great. Thank you for… ROBERT NESBITT Yeah, just amazing. TONY GABLE …allowing us to shoot the breeze [applause]. Oh, another question back there. AUDIENCE MEMBER Maybe it is a perfect time for us to take you guys in the studio instead of gathering round, and do some chopping up with a beat [audience chuckles]. Let us show how we work because we’ve been here for a week, normally it’s like these big studio romantics before us taking us to the studio. Maybe it would be nice if we could show you, like, this is how we work, this is a possible way of working. This is maybe a song or a track we will do something with. ROBERT NESBITT You have something? AUDIENCE MEMBER No, you have something. ROBERT NESBITT Oh, we have something? AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah, and there is enough talent and creative inspiration over here to make something happen. TONY GABLE Well, one thing that changed in Seattle, and I’m sure maybe in other parts of the country, the album recording studios kinda died, kinda went away. These huge studios with double-boards and all that stuff. Everything is smaller and some of the focus is gone from making original music to making commercial music. Like I said, I would come in, and do a 60-second commercial and play four bars [imitates playing] - “Thanks!” “What?” So it’s kind of changed. It might be difficult to find… I mean, Bad Animals is famous. Have you guys have ever heard of Bad Animals? That’s a great studio here. It was actually Kaye-Smith and then it expanded, Heart and some other investors bought it. ROBERT NESBITT Everybody recorded there. TONY GABLE Everybody recorded there at Kaye-Smith and Bad Animals, and even at Glenn Lorbiecki’s Glenn Sound. They also do commercials, but they still are recording original music and original tracks for albums, and that’s just been a shift in how everything works. And now, even us as a fusion band, you gotta be able to play together - but we still do overdubs, we go in and start overdubbing all over. TONY GABLE Thank you very much. ROBERT NESBITT Thank you.

Russell Elevado
You’ll have to look at the small print on records to find the name of Russell Elevado, but be assured he’s there, on some of the most innovative soul records of the ’90s and ’00s. As engineer, producer and mixer for the likes of Alicia Keys, D’Angelo, the Roots, Common, Saul Williams and Erykah Badu, Elevado has won a reputation for recreating the classic sound of the ’60s and ’70s in a modern setting, an analog guy in a digital world.
In his lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, Elevado talked about how he landed behind the boards and gives us the lowdown on the seminal Voodoo sessions.
Hosted by Benji B It seems a shame ever to fade out that song, but I’m going to have to because this is one I’ve been looking forward to ever since my plane touched down. Please him feel very welcome, Mr. Russ Elevado. [Applause] Russell Elevado Thank you, good to be here. Benji B How are you doing, Russ? Russell Elevado Pretty good. I just got in from San Francisco, so getting used to the time change. But great vibes over here, good to be here. Benji B Thanks very much for joining us today. For those who might not be familiar with what you do for a living, couldyou describe what that is? Russell Elevado Basically just have fun everyday, it’s not really work for me. I feel pretty lucky. People pay me to have fun and just experiment, I don’t really consider it work. But basically, I’m an engineer, producer, recording engineer. Benji B And generally speaking, what part of the recording process is that, what does it involve? Russell Elevado Basically, I’m the guy who sets up the microphones, makes sure we’ve got good levels. I still do stuff to tape so I make sure I get good levels to tape. And then I record the band. Hopefully it’s a live band, not just drum machines and stuff, which is kind of dying, but that’s mainly what I do: record live musicians. Benji B So do you want to give us some examples of the artists you’ve worked with over the years? Russell Elevado Alicia Keys, D’Angelo,
The Roots, Common, Saul Williams. There’s a few I’m forgetting.
Erykah Badu, people like that. Roy Hargrove for the jazz fans. Benji B And how do you first come into contact with these people? Is it word of mouth? Russell Elevado It’s been word of mouth my whole career, I’ve never solicited anybody. It’s pretty cool because if people come and seek me out it’s because they know me for a certain thing. It’s not like I’m going around saying, “I want to work with you, I want to work with you.” It’s people who come and find me because they know me for a certain sound. It’s the best way to work. Benji B And how would you describe the texture of the sound you’re looking for? Russell Elevado Probably vintage. All my roots in music has been ‘60s music, ‘70s, some ‘80s like Prince and Michael Jackson and stuff. But my roots are The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye,
Stevie Wonder. Classic soul music, classic rock. Benji B And how did you get into what you do? Was it the classic “making tea” scenario? Russell Elevado Yeah, started at the bottom for sure. Went to school in New York, in the Village, a place called Institute Of Audio Research, which is basically a technical school, a one-year program. But halfway through I started interning at a place called Shakedown Studios, which was owned by a producer called Arthur Baker. So I got the coffee, swept the floors, cleaned the bathrooms. This was before I even graduated from school. I was 19 when I started. I started assisting in different studios, all in New York, and made my way up the ranks, got lucky, being in the right place at the right time. Benji B So basically there’s no substitute for experience? Russell Elevado Not at all. My biggest break came when I mixed two songs on Roberta Flack’s last album. At that point I was doing the whole R&B circuit, making good money, but I wasn’t completely happy with the music. Up until Roberta Flack I was working a lot, but creatively speaking I wasn’t getting to the next step. Just after I did Roberta Flack I met D’Angelo, and he saved my career. I was disillusioned and was ready to stop, I wasn’t really having any fun. I was making money but on a creative level it just wasn’t working. Then his manager played me D’Angelo’s demos and I was like, “Wow! I have to work with this guy.” Benji B This was before Brown Sugar, right? Russell Elevado Yeah, before Brown Sugar. Benji B We know you were involved in the recording of Voodoo, which is an amazing piece of work, but you had some production and engineering credits on the first one, too. Russell Elevado Yeah, I took over where Bob Power left off. They had some creative disagreements and were looking for another person. I was working on Angie Stone’s album when she was in this group Vertical Hold and they had the same manager, who said, “Maybe you should work with D’Angelo.” He played me the songs and I said, “Yes, of course, I’ll work with this guy.” I ended up mixing three songs on the album. Benji B And obviously the relationship just blossomed. The results Voodoo, it’s clearly a very special working relationship. Russell Elevado We totally clicked from the very beginning. We were talking about Voodoo before we even finished Brown Sugar. When I came into it I had heard the song should be mixed in a different way — more raw, more edgy. But we couldn’t do it because seven songs were already mixed and we had to match the album. But he said, “I’m open to your ideas, tell me more.” And we both started playing each other music, our influences, and I said, “We should make your next album sound like this album. Look at Stevie’s album, the drums sound so raw.” And he was, “Yeah, we’ve gotta do it.” So we were talking about the Voodoo album from the beginning. Benji B I guess we should get straight in and talk about Voodoo for a while. I’m happy to go on record and say, from my personal perspective, if you told me to pick my top ten records, I don’t know what the other nine would be, but that would be in there. Obviously, the content is phenomenal, but it has a lot to do with the texture of the sound as well. There are a lot of stories surrounding that album, about how indulgent the recording process was and how long you were in the studio for, and the lead-up to the recording. If you had a goal for that record, sonically, what was it, and was it a shared goal? Russell Elevado Let me see, it may sound corny, but it was definitely my dream project, to really show people that it could be done today, that the records that sounded so amazing in the ‘70s, like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, James Brown, they could be done today with all the gear that’s out there, look at the Neumann U47s and everything. My thing was that people were sampling James Brown and Funkadelic, all those records, so why can’t we just use the same gear they used, use tape and come up with our own organic sound? It’s reminiscent of the ‘70s, but now we have this amazing bandwidth with all this technology. That was pretty much my concept: we can do this, but make it sound even fatter, because now we have automation and super-bandwidth with CD, so now the bass can be even more incredible and each mix can be tweaked out. If Eddie Kramer had this technology back in the day, I can’t even imagine how that stuff would’ve sounded. Now we’re spoiled, because we can automate every single thing and make it perfect. Benji B So am I right in thinking this whole album is live? Russell Elevado 85% is live, yes. Benji B And all recorded to tape? Russell Elevado Every last bit is recorded to tape, yes. [Applause] Benji B Was it five years in the making? Russell Elevado It was three years altogether. Benji B Electric Lady Studios is expensive enough, 2” tape is pretty expensive. Russell Elevado Yeah, we ended up using 120 reels of tape, and we didn’t erase anything, so when we needed more space we would make a copy of one of the 24-track reels and store that reel. For some songs we had five reels and three of them would be vocal takes. Benji B I heard a story that before you started laying down tracks for that album, there were covers of Marvin albums and Prince albums. Is that true? Russell Elevado Yeah, and I think that’s why the spirit of that album is like that. Those jams spawned these songs, that was a part of the whole vibe of the album. They would go in there and jam on Stevie covers for three hours and then an idea would come out of that. Within an hour they would have something, so you would press the recording tape. Benji B And presumably those jams still exist on tape somewhere. Russell Elevado Yeah, there are probably 50 songs altogether. [Laughs] I can see the box set with all the alternate songs, the lost D’Angelo tapes. Benji B So working with tape, you didn’t use any digital audio? Russell Elevado No, there were three songs that had to go into ProTools, only because we had to edit it down because it was really long, or because there was a mistake and we wanted to preserve the live performance. We tried to redo the take with musicians and it didn’t have the same feel, so we had to go into ProTools. Even D’Angelo, I’ve pretty much brainwashed him into believing that ProTools isn’t the best. It’s great for editing, but I still think the sound suffers. It’s getting better, but for me, it doesn’t come close to tape. Benji B So is there ever a point when you go to ProTools or do you just avoid it all cost? Russell Elevado I avoid it as much as possible. I still do 85% of everything to tape and I mix to tape as well. Benji B On this record, there are so many layers. A track like “The Root,” there must be 30 different voices. Russell Elevado There are actually probably more like 40, or more. He would triple each note and do four parts and overlap with each other. When those parts are overlapping, that’s 16 tracks per part overlapping into another 16 tracks. Benji B But when you’re recording to tape you can’t move anything, so every time it’s recorded as live, which makes it even more phenomenal. Russell Elevado Yeah, every single thing is recorded live. No copying or pasting. Benji B Shall we check it out? I think this is probably the most relevant track, in terms of talking about the layering of the vocals. This is a track called “The Root.” Russell Elevado Yes, I think so. Benji B Sorry, my vinyl’s a bit mashed up. I’ve played this one a few times. (music: D’Angelo - “The Root”) Russell Elevado Thank you. Benji B Unbelievable. [Laughs] Russell Elevado That’s a really great tune. His vocals are just angelic. Benji B The backwards guitar bit, was that you? Russell Elevado Yeah, I thought of that because they were jamming to Jimi Hendrix covers, because we were in Electric Lady [Studios]. So I thought, “Let’s reverse the guitar in that section.” Originally it was a straight guitar solo, then we just flipped the tape and played it backwards and it was like, “Yes, that’s it!” Benji B So each time layering those vocals, each time that’s D’Angelo coming up with a new harmony and you just punching it in. Russell Elevado Yes, every time, live. Benji B Talk to me about the personnel on that record. Russell Elevado Pino Palladino. D’Angelo was invited in to duet with BB King. We walked in the studio and Pino was playing the bass and we were waiting for BB to come in. They started jamming, he was on the piano and he started doing these Marvin Gaye covers. The whole band was made up of these veteran musicians who’d been in the business 25 years or whatever – D comes in, and he’s 20-something, and just blows everybody away. But he kept looking over at Pino and he came up to me afterwards and says, “Man, who’s the guy on the bass?” He was playing all this [Motown bassist] James Jamerson stuff, verbatim, too. So he walked up to him and introduced himself as Pino Palladino, and he was like, “Wow! I’ve seen his name all over the records and I’m finally meeting this guy.” Turns out he’s a huge D’Angelo fan. He came to the studio three months after that and that was it, we just fell in love with Pino. Then there’s ?uestlove on the drums, kind of an associate producer for the album. He’s drummer for The Roots. Those two got together and those two together is like… I can’t think of an analogy,
but they’re basically like brothers, they think the same, they can just look at each other and know when they should change. They really have this strong bond musically and spiritually, I think. Hopefully, they can patch things up and he can come back on the record. Right now they’re in a shaky territory. The guitar player on that song is Charlie Hunter. He actually plays bass and guitar at the same time, which is unbelievable, but he plays this eight-string guitar — it’s five strings regular guitar, the top three play bass strings, and he’s got these pick-ups that separate it and he plays both at the same time. He’s a real freak of nature I think, it’s like he’s got two heads. He plays on “Spanish Joint.” Benji B Who plays the bass on “Spanish Joint?” Russell Elevado That’s Charlie. Benji B And where did that come out of? Russell Elevado He had played that song for me on the piano and he was saying he should get Charlie Hunter on it. Charlie’s last day, he was about to leave and D came up to me and said, “Is there anything I’m forgetting, is there a song we should do?” So I said, “How about ‘Spanish Joint’?” “‘Spanish Joint,’ oh shit!” We played it for Charlie and that’s the first take you hear, they got it within an hour or something. They put the arrangement together and that was it. Benji B We’ve got to hear that now. (music: D’Angelo – “Spanish Joint”) Crazy. So that’s Charlie playing bass and guitar at the same time? Russell Elevado Yeah, I watched him doing it and I still can’t believe it. Benji B Eight strings? Russell Elevado Yeah, three bass strings and five guitar strings on the one guitar. Benji B One take? Russell Elevado Yeah, that was the first take. We did two or three and we kept listening to the first one and were like, “Yeah, that’s the one.” Benji B Sonically, two of the sonic things that make this album special are the bass and the drums. Is there anything particular approach recording that you want to mention? When it comes to mic-ing, is there any particular approach? Russell Elevado For that, at least half is the drummer. If the drummer’s got a good sound, it makes my job much easier. My approach is getting a good amount of the whole frequency spectrum. With drums, it goes from 30Hz all the way up, as far as you can hear. Drums and the voice are probably the widest frequency spectrums. I’m trying to capture the whole sound, not just individual drums. I stay in the room with them, stand about five feet away, walk around and see what the whole thing is doing and place the mics accordingly. But I sort of have a similar set-up all the time — depending on the drummer and the room, I just move different room mics around. The overall drum sound, in the end, if I track and mix it, it’s a combination of the separate mics and then the overheads and the room sound. So I’m trying to capture that air I’m feeling in front of the kit. Benji B So how many mics on average do you use for the kit? Russell Elevado On average, probably eight. Two on the snares, two on the kicks and then a single mic on the toms. Usually use a single overhead as well. Many people do stereo overheads, but unless it’s a huge 20-piece kit I’ll just use a single microphone on the top. Benji B And what about the recording equipment? Can you talk to us about Electric Lady Studios and how significant that was in this record? Russell Elevado It’s funny because I’d go and visit D’Angelo in Richmond before we started the album to talk about it, how he visualised it, where we conceptualised it. At that time I turned him on to Jimi Hendrix. He’d only heard “Purple Haze” and “Fire,” so I played him Hendrix and he just freaked out, “Holy shit! All my heroes have been influenced by Hendrix and I never knew it all these years.” Because he’s a huge Prince fan and Prince was all about Hendrix, his whole stage persona is all Hendrix. So I played him some other albums that had been done at Electric Lady, like Stevie Wonder and Led Zeppelin albums, and said we should go there to record it. “What do you mean, it’s still around?” So we went to see the studio, walked into Studio A, and he said, “Yeah, let’s do the album here.” Benji B And presumably Virgin were supportive of that at that time. Russell Elevado At that time. They didn’t realise that a million-and-a-half [dollars] later we’d still be working on the album [laughs]. We weren’t finished at a million-and-a-half. Benji B And when it comes to mixing a record like this, what’s the start point? Do you do the classic of putting everything up to zero and get a feel for it, or have you already start mixing it as you’re recording it, in your mind? Russell Elevado I definitely had a feel as we were tracking it, but I didn’t think it would be as difficult as it was, because we’d keep bringing rough mixes home after the take and we all got used to hearing it in its super-raw form. But I’d say, just keep the rawness and don’t really over-EQ. I wanted it to be as if
someone had found a cassette tape of some obscure band and it’s really old but it still plays with hisses, like an old demo tape that someone had lost. That was the vibe I wanted to create subliminally, a little scattered, but there’s a reason for it. Benji B And how long did the mixing take? Russell Elevado Some mixes were up for two weeks because D’Angelo is a perfectionist. It’d be up for two weeks, but for three or four days he wouldn’t even listen to it, so I’d be left there like, “OK, what can I do?” Which was great for me, because I can experiment, but after a while it was like, “OK, let’s put this to bed, because I’m losing perspective.” The hardest part at the end was keeping the perspective, because in my head I was ready to move forward and this was old. Not that I didn’t love it, but I was ready to move on. So the hardest part of the last part of the mixing process was maintaining what I was doing. Benji B Talk to me about the track “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” because you just mentioned the Prince and Hendrix influence and you can definitely hear it on that one. Russell Elevado It’s funny, because for every song I can think of a few stories. For “Untitled,” we were already past about ten deadlines. Two years later he walks up to me and says, “I want to cut this new song.” I said, “You want to cut this new song? We already have about 50 we can work on.” And he just walked out, because at that time nobody could pressure D’Angelo. So the record label came to me to put pressure on me to try to put pressure on D’Angelo. So we were hugely over-budget, we’ve already missed the tenth deadline and he’s trying to cut a new song. He walked out the studio, just walked around, had a beer, came back, and said, “Come on, Russ” – as if nothing had happened. And he played me the song. As soon as I heard it I was like, “OK, let’s record it.” And that was the last song we recorded, the single. (music: D’Angelo - “Untitled (How Does it Feel)”) Benji B So the record that we’re listening to is a complete album. I was interested in getting your take on the concept of the album, the LP, which seems to be an increasingly lost artform in itself. Russell Elevado An album in general? Benji B Yeah, the concept of the album, something you want to listen to from start to finish. How relevant is it putting music together in LP format in 2007, keeping that alive? Because this definitely feels like it’s mixed and programmed as an LP experience rather than just random songs. Russell Elevado I don’t know how to turn that around because now it’s all about the producer, especially in the hip-hop and R&B world. “Who’s producing it? Oh, it’s a new artist, Timbaland
produced it, it should be good, or Missy produced it.” Then there’s 20 songs of completely wack material. You buy it and you get two good songs. What a waste of time. So no wonder everyone’s downloading, they don’t want to spend the cash for two songs on an album’s worth of complete garbage. [Applause] Benji B What are some of your favourite LPs of all time, in terms of sound as well as content? Russell Elevado Definitely all of the Jimi Hendrix albums, definitely a big influence. I grew up playing guitar and the way his records would make you feel; same with all The Beatles records. Even to this day I’ll still pick them up and be like, “Holy shit! I didn’t realize they compressed the drums on this part.” And Stevie Wonder, his albums have this raw quality where everything sounds like it’s in the room. When you close your eyes it feels like the drummer’s sitting right there and the vocals are over there with the horns. I was a big Pink Floyd fan. But are you talking about records in general? Benji B I was thinking more from a mix and sound perspective, but I guess just as an overall experience. Russell Elevado Definitely Dark Side Of The Moon, it’s awesome from top to bottom. When I
was growing up in New York there was a radio station that would play perfect album sides every Thursday. People would call in and request their perfect album sides. So one of them would be Abbey Road, another great one from top to bottom, you don’t want to take the needle off the record until you have to turn it over. Benji B And how depressing is it when you’ve put all that work in and you have to hear it as an MP3? Russell Elevado I’ve gotten used to it because you just can’t help it anymore, but it’s a shame that it’s a substandard that’s become the standard. Not because people prefer it, but just out of necessity. With iPods, you can get your little iPod Shuffle now and put all your songs in there. It’s cool for that, but people don’t really care about it anymore, which is kind of sad. I’m one of the guys trying to keep it alive. If you compare something in analog with something done entirely in digital, there’s just no comparison. Hands down, you can’t compare it. Benji B Even if I was playing a WAV or an AIF off that computer, and then off CD, you could hear the difference between those two? Russell Elevado Yeah, it’s the converter. People don’t realize, if you take care of every aspect of the process it’s going to show at the end of it. If you skip a process or cheat in the middle, it’s going to show. Say, if you used a great mic but the vocalist was in a rush or couldn’t take care of that particular
thing, or you could’ve used tape that day but it was easier to use ProTools because it was up. But if you’re careful through the whole process, if you take the time and do it, it’s going to show at the end of the project. You’ll be like, “Wow! I’m so glad I did it like this.” That’s why these records sound
like that. Benji B When you’re listening to your iPod do you only put AIF or WAV on there? Russell Elevado Yeah. [Laughs] In fact I just got my first iPod this year. It took me ten years to even get a CD player for my house, that’s how much of a huge analog fan I am. Benji B But from a mixing perspective, how important is it to know what it will sound like when it goes there? Because you know it will go there. It’s like in the old days, people used to listen on crappy speakers because they knew what it would sound like on the radio. Is that a consideration for you now, because you know people will listen to it as a crap MP3? Russell Elevado No, I don’t consider that at all, though I do listen to it on my computer, especially if I’m in a studio. Say I go to Europe to mix a project, and I’m in a foreign studio, I’ll listen to it on as many different systems as I can. I’ll try playing it in a club or in cars, the shittiest speakers I can find. That’s pretty much a standard because it’s got to be able to play anywhere. Every time I do a mix I take it home and play it in the car two or three times before I come in the next day. Benji B A lot of DJs and collectors who are transferring to digital now may have started off like you and been purist, thinking everything’s got to be AIF, WAV, 44.1, CD quality, whatever, and then after a while realized that if you’re going to put your music collection on there you’re going to need some Nasa level storage to get it all on. And then, if you take the Pepsi challenge on a 320 MP3 and an AIF, the average person will never get it. But it’s still quite upsetting to you to hear your music compressed even to that level, right? Russell Elevado It used to, but I’ve got so used to it, it really doesn’t bother me anymore. But the mixes are done so well, when it gets down to that level, I can hear it, but I really don’t pay attention. Benji B Would you rather hear your music played off vinyl or CD? Russell Elevado If it’s on vinyl, it’s got to be a good system. That’s one reason people don’t have it in their homes because you really need a good turntable, a good system. But CDs you can get away with a smaller system and still make it sound loud and have bass. I prefer vinyl, but I’ll listen to a CD. Benji B So you’re not going anywhere near a computer, you’re printing everything to tape, everything analog. For those people who have basic set-ups at home, who don’t have Neve [recording] desks at home and access to an SSL [mixing console], what steps can we take to ensure we can record good quality vocals in a bedroom situation or a nice quality guitar part? Russell Elevado Look at your budget. It really starts with a good microphone and a good mic preamp. You don’t have to buy a Neve console but you can buy a really high quality mic preamp. If you’re looking for that quality but you don’t have a major budget, save up for a really good microphone or at least a medium level one. Don’t buy the all-you-can-do boxes. Wait a little bit, save your money for the next level up. As far as recording into ProTools, the same thing: use high quality converters. I know some can be really expensive, but there are medium quality converters that are affordable these days. But definitely stay away from the all-in-one boxes. They’re good if you’re just starting out and can tweak your sound; it just depends how you’re perceiving your sound and approaching your music. You have to use what you can. If you’re limited, it’s all about your ears. There are definitely some crappy systems that make everything sound like crap that you should stay away from, but that’s why you should test everything out before you buy it, or listen to word of mouth. But there’s no getting around really high quality gear. Benji B Are you finding loads of studios around the world are closing around you? Russell Elevado Yes, it’s pretty much drying up, unfortunately, and it’s because of the ProTools revolution. I started interning in ‘86 and back then people were still coming in to do their demos. People would cut a deal with the manager, “I want to cut a demo, can you do it for this price, X amount of days?” Then he would end up working in the studio because the manager looked out for them. Then, when they get signed, they would do the album there. Now people are doing their demos in their house, which is fine, it’s just the evolution of production. But there’s the whole thing where people can do it in their homes and the record labels don’t want to spend the money anymore, the budgets have gone way down, because you can do everything in ProTools and cut an album for X amount of money. It’s killed the studio business. Benji B So studios are closing down, no one’s using 2” reels of tape at home. How do you as an engineer maintain the standards you care about? Russell Elevado Fortunately, most people ask me what format I want it on. Most people who want to work with me, if they know I’m going to mix their album, they’ll make sure it’s recorded as well as possible. So I’m spoiled. Benji B How important is mastering to the final mix of an album? What percentage is down to it? Russell Elevado It depends. If you get someone to mix it and it really sucks, the mastering person can save it and push the frequencies that are missing or delete. So then the mastering engineer can save you. A lot of the time people are coming in with ProTools files with stems and they’re kind of remixing the album in mastering. Now mastering can go on for two days because they’re re-doing levels, they have everything separated – drums, bass, vocals – and they’ll make final decisions in the mastering. But if your mixes are really good, then the mastering is just icing, getting the level up to CD level. Benji B Do you want to talk about the artists you’ve worked with over the years? Russell Elevado No, I just want to talk about D’Angelo. Just kidding. Benji B I know you’ve worked with a number of amazing artists over the last ten years: Common, The Roots, Erykah Badu. Where does the role of recording and mix engineer end and producer begin? Or is that a blurry line? Russell Elevado It’s a pretty blurry line. The really good mixers should get more of a co-production credit, because in the end it’s in the hands of the mixer. Most people come to me and I’ve never heard the album before, and it’s a pair of fresh ears. It takes a lot of trust from people to hand me something they’ve been working on and say, “Here, see what you can do with it.” The really good mixers do a lot of production. Benji B So, say, on a track like “The Seed” by The Roots, that’s got a very particular sound to it, almost like an era. Russell Elevado That’s a great example. ?uestlove pretty much gives me the concept. We have a good relationship. Out of all the artists I work with, besides D’Angelo, Ahmir is the one who can push me the furthest. Every time I work with him I need to push myself further than I would with other artists. He’s very experimental, and with both of us being that way we feed off each other. So
with “The Seed” he said he wanted to sound like a garage band, but hi-fidelity. He said, “Go for the biggest drums, but old-sounding.” I just experimented until I could get the drums sounding huge without overpowering everything. Benji B Have you got that? Russell Elevado Yes, let’s see [scans tracklist]. Track ten. (music: The Roots - “The Seed”) Benji B Which album is that from? Russell Elevado Phrenology. Benji B You seem to get sounds representing a particular era in some of your tracks, like “Green Eyes” by Erykah Badu. What was the concept of that? Because it seems to go from old school jazz texture, but there are three big sections in there. Russell Elevado That’s exactly what it is. The producer,
James Poyser, and Erykah came up to me and said, “We want to tell a story and go through different eras.” So it goes from Billie Holiday and ‘60s jazz to the modern age, like D’Angelo and R&B. That was definitely the concept, each section. Benji B So if I came into your studio and said I wanted to make a Billie Holiday type of record, what would you do technically to achieve that? Russ Elevado: I would research what they had when they were recording Billie Holiday and try to get the gear, or just emulate it with what I had. The process happens as I go along, but I do reference different music when I mix, especially if I’m going for a particular sound. Benji B So what did you use for that track? Russell Elevado I definitely listened to Billie Holiday for that section, and I’m a big jazz lover, too, so for the middle section I knew I could stay in the Miles Davis thing. RBMA And then for the last bit, present day? Russell Elevado Present day. Benji B Do you want to check that out? Audience Yes. Benji B It’s a long one, and you have to listen to the whole thing to really get it. Everyone still up for it? No one falling asleep? Cool. What track number is it? You asked for it, ten minutes long. Russell Elevado A lot of these artists come to me with what I call their epic songs and they know I can tackle it. I love the challenge when an artist comes up with the song that really represents them, not the one that the record company are freaking out over, but the one that’s their special one. I’m flattered that a lot of these artists save their special ones for me because I can take it to the epic sort of thing. Benji B Let’s check it out. (music: Erykah Badu – “Green Eyes”) Again, totally amazing. How long does something like that to even start putting together? Russell Elevado I remember working three or four days on that one. The drums for the second and third parts were all recorded in one shot so I had to make them sound different. Originally, we were going to mix it in two different times, but just for the flow, I decided to do it in one shot. It took about three to four days, then Erykah wanted to change something, so I had to recall it, get all my settings back on all my analog gear and remix it again. So pretty much about six days, seven days, including the second time. Benji B So when it comes to recording, how complex is that in the analog world? Russell Elevado It’s definitely a process. There’s no longer the apprentice. It’s a special craft and the craft is really starting to die. That’s why I came here to do this, to hopefully inspire people to keep it alive. Now you’ve got all these plugins that can make it sound like this or that, but you should really try to research how that sound… because these sounds aren’t new, they’re just old sounds that came about from earlier engineers experimenting with tape. Everything is tape-based effects — you’re just delaying, manipulating the sound to be delayed so you can create phasing, flanging, doubling and delays. People should learn there was a certain standard at one point and it’s come down to a substandard. But there aren’t many studios… Benji B Yeah, if I want to do that, where can I do it? Russell Elevado Unfortunately, there aren’t many studios, but I learned everything when I was interning and assisting. It took me about six years before I went freelance as an engineer. During the transitional phase I worked with anybody until it got to the point where I could work with better artists. But it’s just about experience. I’ve been doing it for 21 years now, so if you do it for a certain amount of time, you have to pick something up. But there’s no substitute for experience. Try to do either an apprenticeship with an engineer or work for a major studio and be around that environment. I learned a lot of stuff assisting, just learning the craft of basic microphone placement, what mic to use, studio etiquette, just the vibe of how to treat the artist the best possible to get the best possible performance. A lot of people aren’t learning that these days, just the craft – it’s not a craft anymore. Hopefully I can
come back and teach some more about it. I was offered the chance to teach some stuff at Berklee [College of Music], so I’m probably going to do that. Just pass it on before it completely dies. Benji B You’re going to be around for a little while, yeah? So we can hopefully get some direct one-to-one tuition in the studios. Russell Elevado Definitely. Benji B Talking of recording, you talked about different scenarios. Do you ever record choirs and orchestras as well? Russell Elevado I’ve recorded a choir, not too many orchestras. I think a 20-piece was the biggest I’ve ever done. I’d love to track a 100-piece orchestra, it’s something I need to do before I die. I love the challenge of getting the best recording in situations, I used to dream about that when I was younger. The first time I recorded a live band, I was so excited. I really like trying to get the best drum sound, the best bass drum, the best horns, best any sound. Benji B Talking of choirs, in terms of that bigger sound, I didn’t realise until yesterday you were responsible for a record that’s been a big DJ record for me, a tune by Tye Tribbett called “Mighty Long Way,” which features a how-many-piece choir? Russell Elevado It’s a 20-piece choir. Benji B And who recorded that? Russell Elevado Again, James Poyser, who produced Erykah, he played keyboards on Voodoo and did that tour, he worked with Lauryn Hill. I’m trying to give him his props because he doesn’t get it enough. He’s very talented, plays in his church in Philly, this huge congregation, every Sunday. He really comes from the church, so he’s the choir arranger. He’d been working with this group and asked me to mix it. Not a lot of people know this group, but the people that do, when they realize I worked on it, they’re like, “Holy shit! I never knew about this, everybody should hear it.” It’s one of those albums that’s incredible, but nobody knows about it. Benji B Well, let’s have a listen. Have you got “Mighty Long Way” with you? Russell Elevado Sure. (music: Tye Tribbett — “Mighty Long Way”) Benji B There was a couple of songs you wanted to talk us through quickly in terms of other sounds and stuff, right? Russell Elevado Yeah, I mean, I just put together a playlist trying to encompass most of the things that I do. Just play a couple quick snippets of them. Benji B Maybe talk us through a few of them and then we’ll open it out to the floor if you’ve got any questions to ask about the tunes. Russell Elevado Okay. This one’s Blackalicious. I don’t know if anyone’s heard of them. That’s the first track. It’s just a good tune. Saul Williams is doing the poetry in the middle section. Just not sure when I’m going to be able to fade this. It might be a longer snippet than the rest of it because it kind of needs to go into that section, so here it is. (music: Blackalicious ft. Saul Williams & Lyrics Born — “Release”) Yeah, that group, that’s Blackalicious, they’re these guys from the San Francisco Bay Area. I got hooked up with them through The Roots. Another producer who just lets me be as creative as possible. When someone gives me that freedom, the mixes just kind of take a life of their own. That particular one, that’s Saul Williams, who’s an amazing poet... he’s like our modern day poet. It’s basically just two guys, Gift of Gab is doing the rap and this guy Chief Xcel is doing the beats and stuff. Just two guys. Benji B Is there anything else you want to talk about? Russell Elevado Just one more song. It’s this guy called Keziah Jones, I don’t know if you know of him. He’s a guitar player, he’s really from Lagos but he went to school in England and got signed to a label in Paris. That’s track nine. Kind of like a wacky song where the drums change a few different times. (music: Keziah Jones — “72 Kilos”) Benji B Keziah Jones, right? Russell Elevado Yeah. Benji B Any questions? Audience Member Thanks for the amazing tracks and interesting lecture, but how do you design your stereo units? Do you draw a map or something, do you have an idea of where everything should be? Russell Elevado I don’t really have a plan when I start, I just feel it as the mix progresses. Sometimes I start off with maybe the guitar on one side, but then in the end it winds up in the middle or wherever. But it’s just a feel. Other times I approach it with the rhythm section off to the side. I’m really big with trying to make everything separate. My approach is to try to make it so, if they close their eyes, people can picture the musicians in the room. Audience Member Thanks. How have you trained your ears? Have you been closing your eyes and listening? Russell Elevado I always loved how things sounded. I was always the one who, when I got to somebody’s house, I would EQ their system, tune in their car stereos. I’ve always been like that. In my teenage years, I would lock myself in my room, smoke some pot and listen to music, just by myself, I would just pull out a bunch of albums and sit there for hours and just listen. Audience Member OK, yeah. One more question. If someone comes to you and asks for a certain sound like that, you should get a natural drum sound or something, where do you refer? There’s so many starting points for a drummer, for example, the natural sound is the one you hear on the drummer’s seat, and for someone in the audience, it’s the sound you hear from the PA. Russell Elevado You question is, what’s my reference? Audience Member Yeah. Russell Elevado Really, it’s just something I hear in my head. Sometimes, while the band is rehearsing, it will immediately click and I can just go for something. Most of the time, it just develops. The drummer will usually feed off the sound that I’m giving him and it just becomes sort of like a relationship. That happens. Yeah. Audience Member Okay, yeah. Thanks. Audience Member Did you work with [Atlantic Records producer] Tom Dowd at all? Russell Elevado I wish. I really wish. That guy was amazing, man. True innovator. Definitely one of my heroes for production, for record production, yeah. Audience Member Any of the other guys, like [Beatles producer] George Martin or…? Russell Elevado As far as engineers? No. I bumped into George Martin one day, which kind of freaked me out. I would say the biggest engineer or producer I worked with would probably be Bob Stone, who did all the Queen stuff. I’ve worked kind of on and off with Eddie Kramer. This guy Michael Barbiero. That’s probably about it. I would’ve died at the chance to work with George Martin or Tom Dowd. Audience Member Also, are you involved with the mastering as well? Do you sit in on the mastering sessions? Russell Elevado Yes, absolutely, especially if I do the entire album. It’s easy enough for someone who doesn’t know what the vision was to begin with to just tweak it to his ears. Yeah, I definitely make sure I’m there for the mastering. In which case, I don’t touch too much of it, because by the time it gets to mastering I really know, I’ve heard it on a couple systems and I know what to tweak. Audience member I know you’re really pushing the bass, the bottom on stuff. It plays really tight, but it’s right there. Are you maxing it out onto the tape? Russell Elevado Yeah, that comes from the master. That’s not done in mastering. That comes when I’m mixing, yeah, the bottom is there. Audience Member Cool, man. Cheers. Russell Elevado Thanks. Audience Member Do you have any tips on properly mic-ing up pianos? Russell Elevado If you have some good tube mics, it really shines on a piano. You can get away with some Neumann condensers, but really the best sound I’ve got is using tube mics, like some Neumann U67 or C24 stereo mics. Audience Member How many mics do you generally use? Russell Elevado Two usually. I’ll either go for a stereo mic or just do the X-Y. Audience Member We talked about my question two seconds ago, but I just want to ask you, I spend my life in cars listening to my music trying to get the mix right, and I’m wondering what is the exact difference on a track before and after the mastering? How “achieved” is the song when you come into the mastering? You surprised me when you said the guys are still tweaking with the song on ProTools when they go in there, because I had the conception of people still sending tapes to mastering, even though I’ve never seen a tape in my life. [Laughs]But that’s just how it is, you have to bring the final product. But what’s the difference? I know the mastering studio, because it’s a proper step, looks totally different from a mixing studio, so what exactly is it that’s done in there? Russell Elevado Most of the time, before you get to mastering, the levels of the master mixes are not quite as loud as they are for CD. That’s one part. The other part is, you’re done with everything and you can just put the icing on. If the quality is good and it’s been properly engineered and mixed… Audience Member With the general levels of the tracks you’ve mixed? Russell Elevado With the general levels of the master mix, once it’s been mixed to half-inch. Then it can go there and it’s basically a little bit of fine tuning, so you can brighten it up, put in a little bit more top or bottom. Audience Member Thanks for coming to share the information with us. I’ve got some questions. Let’s say you’re mixing a tune that’s going to be put on a CD, say a drum & bass tune that’s going to be played on a proper dub reggae soundsystem. The bassline is a detuned
808
, so it’s a sine wave bassline, it’s around 50-60Hz. Would you high-pass that bassline at around 20-30Hz? Russell Elevado I would if it needs it. Sure. Sometimes you’d be surprised, actually taking out bass will create more bass. As far as the mixing aspect, it’s all about the frequencies. It’s called masking and you can’t explain it all the time on a technical level, but aurally, if you listen to it, after it gets to your ear it can create an illusion where there’s phasing. Different frequencies clashing together can actually phase themselves out and create dead space, or a frequency will jump out at you. So pulling out a frequency can create more room and actually push the bass. Audience Member Thanks. I’ve got a few more. What’s your view on boosting EQs during mixing? Russell Elevado Boosting? Audience Member Yeah. Russell Elevado Yeah, you know what? I don’t really have any rules. If you need to push it to get a certain effect and it feels good to you, then by all means. I’ve pushed lots of EQs in my day. Is that what you mean? Audience Member Yeah, totally. Russell Elevado Just drastic EQ-ing? Audience Member Yeah, just boosting EQs. Some people say, stay away. Russell Elevado Oh, either additive or subtractive EQ-ing. Audience Member Yeah, like adding certain frequencies to a vocal or to a kick drum or something, as opposed to just cutting frequencies out of a certain sound? Russell Elevado Yeah, I kind of do both. As I’ve been just going through my career, now I’ll kind of start by either cutting or boosting and see which one works the best for me. Audience Member Also, just say you’re going to master a tune for a CD to be played in a club, what processes would you go through in software, for people who don’t have and can’t access hardware? What process would you go through in terms of mastering? Like the steps of EQ or compression or limiter and that type of thing. Russell Elevado If you don’t have analog gear? Audience Member Yeah. Russell Elevado I’m not sure because I never do it that way. I couldn’t even tell you what plugins to use because I don’t do it. I don’t use it. Audience Member Fair enough. Russell Elevado Sorry. Audience Member That’s fine. Any advice if you are writing for sound systems and you are writing in mono? Do you have any advice in that? Russell Elevado Sorry? Say again? Audience Member If you’re writing tunes specifically for sound systems and you’re writing in mono, do you have any advice for that? Russell Elevado If you’re trying to mix in mono, just with one speaker? Is that what you mean? Audience Member Yeah, or if you’re writing a tune in mono because you know that you’re going to be playing in certain clubs and the clubs only have, like the sound system’s running in mono. Russell Elevado OK. Audience Member Yeah. Do you have any advice if you’re writing tunes in mono for that purpose? Russell Elevado No. It’s good to ... I mix quite a bit in mono at a certain point. I’ll use, it’s called an R Tone. It’s just kind of like a three-inch speaker, just like a cube. I’ll go to that a lot to get levels and low, too. You don’t have to really crank it up to hear. In fact, things like harmonies become clearer when you’ve got it at a minimum level. Audience Member All right. Thanks a lot, thank you. Audience Member Hey again. You were saying that you played guitar before – has being a musician, or having an interest as a musician, has helped you get those journey and those epic mixes? Russell Elevado I think it definitely helps. Any sort of musical background, obviously, is going to help you through if you’re wanting to be specifically an engineer or a producer or both. I definitely think it helps in relating to artists and how they’re trying to get their sound across, if they’re trying to explain to you, or even just helping the session move a little better as far as knowing when different sections are going to come up. A vocalist could be in the room, or a horn player, and they may not be able to hear that they’re off key. If you’re not really a musician, you might not be able to hear that the person is off. Things like that definitely help the session on a technical level. It’s not to say that you have to be a musician to do that. Audience Member Cool. What is the exact difference between an engineer and a producer? If you’re suggesting ideas to the person who’s recording, is there then a producer role? Russell Elevado Technically, I guess back in the day, the producer was kind of the director, basically. Points people in the right direction and steers them along or tries to get an emotion, kind of directs the whole band or what have you. Then the engineer would be just the technical guy. I look at the engineer like a cinematographer and then the producer as a director. That’s the traditional roles. Now, the producer is sort of like the songwriter. The engineer’s roles, I guess, have always remained, but the producer now seems to be not that person that directs the whole thing – they’re kind of like the song writer, at least for R&B and pop music. Audience Member One more question. When you put some stuff on vinyl, do you send a tape and they record vinyl from a tape? So they won’t be in a digital format, so it will be all the time only analog? Russell Elevado Wait, I’m sorry, say again? Audience Member When you put some stuff on vinyl, do you send them a tape? How do they record the vinyl? Russell Elevado That’s a good question, because most of the vinyl, I could just call them transfers now. It’s not really vinyl mastering anymore. It still comes off the digital master for the CD and they just transfer it onto the lathe. The true, true analog mastering is a huge process. For people that still really want to do it these days, it’s like a huge calibration, because everything’s CD now, it gets stored in the back and the few times that people need this machine to get the proper analog mastering, it just costs a lot of money. A lot of times, yeah, they’re using the digital master to make the vinyl copy. Audience Member So you can’t basically maintain the analog format all the time. Russell Elevado Yeah, exactly. Audience Member My friend tells me you post on a forum about sound techniques. Do you have the address? Russell Elevado It’s Gearslutz.com. Once you get to the home page and scroll down to the bottom, I’m linked in the archives under ‘guest spot,’ I think they call it. Audience Member OK, cool. Also, just out of curiosity, I remember in the sleeve notes for Voodoo you’re referred to as “Russ the Dragon”. What’s that about? You’ve got a tattoo, as well. Russell Elevado It’s actually because I’ve got some dragon tattoos and me and D got a tattoo together at the same time. When his manager saw it he was like, “Oh. We’re going to call you the dragon from now on.” It’s funny, because I said once we were done with it I wanted to have my credit just proper, Russell Elevado, you know, because I was so proud of it. I don’t want some nickname attached to it because, you know, just proper. They put it on there anyway and I was really pissed at first, then it just became a thing and now I’m like, OK, whatever. Now people ask me, “You want the dragon, you want it on there or not?” I just say, “You decide. I don’t care. If you can fit it on, if not.” Audience Member Thanks for the whole experience, but I’d like to ask if you don’t use any sort of digital instruments in your setup? Never? Russell Elevado Sometimes I do, it depends on the session. Audience Member Like synthesizers and stuff? Russell Elevado Yes, sometimes. A lot of the time the artists who are coming to me are on the same thing anyway, bringing in analog keyboards and stuff. If I see a digital piece, I don’t go, “No, get it out of here.” I just prefer analog, it’s what I’m used to, it’s what I can make sound really good. Audience Member Something you touched on before about certain mics you can get. There are a lot of live musicians here, we’ve got some vocalists, horn players, and it would be good if you could expand on that. I know Neumann are good, but I can’t say, for instance, for vocals get this, for percussion get this. It would be good if you could expand on some of the mics and companies we could go to. Russell Elevado Let’s see. Neumann make the TLM-103 and the KM-84 series. Those are excellent mics for your budget. If you can save – I know it’s a lot of money for most people starting out – $800-1000, you’re not going to be sorry. You’re going to be like, “Wow! I got this really great mic.” And then just go from there. A good budget mic would be Audio-Technica, they make some really good mics for the money. Some of the entry level Neumann mics are really good for the money. There’s this one company... can’t remember the name, but I would stay away from. Even the Shure mic, or a 121, I still use those regularly on drums. I never normally go to a 421 on the toms and the snare, I’ll always use a SN-57, which is what, $100. Audience Member It’s like $60. Russell Elevado So little things like that. I would definitely cruise the forums, check out Gearslutz and research. Don’t go blindly into Guitar Center and buy the latest, greatest thing. I would definitely do the research before you do it. You can find good details on eBay. I’m trying to look for the person who asked me this, oh, you’re over there. [Laughs]Definitely do the research. Audience Member Thank you very much, this is really a great day for me. This is amazing stuff, but I do have a question on my own interest. Particularly on the gospel track and the density of the voices, the number of different voices – do you have any tips on density management? Russell Elevado That’s a tough one and something I’ve learned just from mixing all these years. A lot of it has to do with blends, I spend a lot of time blending a particular section. Mostly I start off with instruments, then when I get to that track, I know I’m faced with tons of vocals. So I’ll get the track kind of happening, not all the way, and then I’ll put the vocals in right away, instead of waiting and doing it as a step-by-step process. I do the frequencies I know I’m going to have to do a lot of work on right away with the track. It’s never good to stay in solo mode and hear the instrument by itself because it’s going to sound completely different once it’s in the track. I only solo if I’m hearing a problem or searching for a different frequency. Most of the time I’m EQing everything in the track as it’s playing all together. As for vocals, I’ll spend time with minute little rides for the levels. Instead of having one level set, I’ll take every note in each harmony and move things around until they’re sitting perfectly. A lot of it has to do with placement, too, I spend a lot of time putting it in the sound field instead of just here or there, just spreading it out. For the choir I had the bass in the middle choir then the highs on the right side. Spread it out. Audience Member Thanks a lot. Audience Member Have you done any recordings outside the studio? Russell Elevado Live recording? Audience Member Different from the studio, like field recordings. Like for a musical or for the cinema or whatever. I’m not sure if you have any knowledge of this, but there’s quite a difference between proper instrument microphone rather than shotgun microphone. Russell Elevado I’ve had limited experience on that. Just once, before I got started, friends and I would experiment. But professionally I’ve not done it, though I have done a lot of live recordings. Audience Member Do you have any references of people who do it? Russell Elevado You should research some of the film guys, the ones who go out and get the Foley, exactly. Read up on those guys because I’ve got some good information from looking at those things on film guys. It’s something I’d love to do, mix sound for film. Benji B Any more questions? Russell Elevado How many people want to study engineering? [Audience raise hands off camera] How many people are musicians? Last thing, how many people want to go into production? Benji B Absolutely fascinating lecture, thank you so much for sharing.

Sinden
First appearing within British dance music in the early 2000s, Sinden soon made a name as part of a new breed of young producers unafraid to reshape and redefine UK club sounds by voraciously borrowing from the past and present. Raised on a standard diet of hip-hop and electronic music, Sinden cut his teeth with some help from Dave Taylor before setting up a collaboration with Herve, the Count & Sinden, that brought them to the attention of Domino Records and a 2010 debut album. Since then he has relocated to Los Angeles where he continues to push forward a distinctively British take on euphoric big room sounds.
In this lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, Sinden explained the appeal of fast and hyperactive music and how his hip-hop heroes have influenced his evolution.
Hosted by Emma Warren So Sinden, Hervé, Switch have all been breaking up dancefloors over the last year or so with something which sounded to me last night like a kind of turbo ghetto dance… Sinden I like turbo. Turbo is an apt term. Emma Warren Why is turbo a good term for what you do? Sinden Because it’s very energetic, very fast-paced. It’s a fitting term, it’s hyperactive, it doesn’t sit still, it’s always moving about, that’s how we make our tracks. They don’t stay still for any long time; they’re just moving along and switching it up. Emma Warren And the term “tearing up the dancefloor” seems quite apt. Sinden Yes, it does. We were recently pictured on the front cover of a magazine with chainsaws tearing up the speakers. Emma Warren Which of your tracks has had the most chainsaw type effect at the moment? Sinden We just did this new remix for Estelle, who’s a UK rapper. I might play it later, actually, it’s got a very trance kind of bassline, which is kind of tearing. Emma Warren Is this something you’ve been playing out recently? Sinden Yes, we just literally finished it last week and sent it off to the label to be approved. We haven’t heard back yet, but it’s doing really well in the clubs. Emma Warren Estelle goes trance, we should definitely have a listen to that one. Sinden We should do. Emma Warren Before we start listening to what you do, I thought it might be interesting to start with how prolific you’ve been. You’ve done an awful lot of remixes over the last 18 months. Sinden Yeah, it’s been crazy. It’s really taken off over the last couple of years, just remixing really hard. It’s a really good challenge to do, various artists have been coming: indie bands, rappers, dancehall artists, world music artists. That’s the challenge for me, reinterpreting what they do and putting our flavor on there, just putting our little signature on it. Emma Warren There aren’t a lot of people who could do Pharoahe Monch, To My Boy and god knows what else, Lady Sovereign, all in their remix CV. Sinden Yeah, it’s great and now I want to continue to work with more bands, that’s more interesting to me at the moment. I’m from a hip-hop background, so taking rap vocals is second nature, but doing something with bands is interesting. I love all the parts they give us, all the stems, all the drums and vocals. That’s cool. Emma Warren Did you start doing remixes because you were asked to do them or because you wanted to create stuff for your DJ sets? Sinden A little bit of both. Obviously, to get paid, remixes are the best. But we’re doing club tours as well, so we’ll make tunes for our DJ sets, just to spice them up. A lot of them don’t get released but it’s something that defines our DJ sets and makes them stand out from others. Emma Warren That’s something that taps into that old thing about having to go to see a DJ to hear a track. Sinden That’s true, it’s not a commodity you can go out and buy. It’s something you’d only hear if you listen to one of my DJ sets or heard a radio mix. Obviously, there’s a lot of sampling, which is why it might not always come out. Not that that’s been a big issue for us, we’ve always put out sampled tracks before. Emma Warren It changes the relationship between a DJ and people on the dancefloor, if you know you’re going to be getting something there that you can’t get anywhere else. It also means that you’re putting more in because you’re having to make the effort to go to hear the stuff. Do you find that people that come and see you… hmm, that’s a bit of a cul-de-sac question, isn’t it? Sinden [Laughs] I don’t know, possibly. I like to think I offer something more than just playing my own tracks or tracks I’m into. Hopefully, people will go back thinking, “Wow! I never heard that that before, that’s really cool.” Emma Warren So how prolific are you, how many remixes do you do in an average week? Sinden At the minute, we’re doing one or two a week, we just need to put them away. But it’s time we started holding back on the remixes a bit, because we’ve got an album we’re working on, so maybe it’s time we stop saturating the market and hold a bit back for the album. Emma Warren So, who’s the “we” in this? Sinden That’s my production partner, Count Of Monte Cristal who also goes by the name of Hervé. He’s a guy I’ve been working with for the last year, a very talented producer. Emma Warren I think one of the trademarks about your stuff is the really distinctive, specific noises. What’s your favorite noise at the moment? Sinden That’s difficult, I quite like this Estelle noise. A lot of our remixes are featuring quite trancey sounds. I don’t know if we should be going there with trance, but someone has to and twist it up. We’re not afraid, nothing’s a no-no, we don’t say “that sound’s out,” we’ll always go back and try something no one’s done for ten years. Emma Warren One of the things that’s interesting about what you’re all doing is you’re pulling stuff out of the past, but the stuff that’s cool now is stuff that was the most uncool first time around. Sinden Yeah, and that’s the dance music I grew up on. Now Technotronic and 2 Unlimited and Euro-rave is in trend at the moment. It’s cool, I can go and dig back through my old stuff. I’m not ashamed. Emma Warren But it’s really good, because otherwise people can end up trawling one path and it can get dry. There’s stuff in these records that have been deemed untouchable for a long time that suddenly makes them sound fresh again. Sinden That’s true, music can get stagnated and a lot of people seem to be copying certain trailblazers in the scene. To put your own spin on it is refreshing, if you can bring something new and fresh to the scene that’s how it’s going to evolve. Emma Warren I think we should have a listen to one of your biggest records at the minute. Can we have a bit of “Beeper,” please? (music: The Count & Sinden – “Beeper” / applause) Sinden Thanks. That’s actually a new version with a rapper called Kid Sister, who you may know. Originally, that song used a sample of Pharrell and Fam-lay, but we had legal issues with it. We approached Pharrell and his lawyers to clear it, but they were going to take a whole load of our publishing, so we thought we’d get Kid Sister on it. The only thing left of the original is the hook and she put new lyrics on it, so it’s pretty much an original record now. Emma Warren And we’ve just had a little exclusive of it. Basslines seem to come from a different place than other genres which rely on basslines. It doesn’t come so much from the reggae soundsystem school, more the booty bass, Miami side of things. Would you say that’s true? Sinden Yes, definitely. We’re very influenced by ghetto house from Chicago and Detroit, and Miami bass music, hip-hop too. It’s funny, I was never really into house music until I met Switch and people like that. For me, it didn’t really have that bassline sound. But as soon as I heard his productions I started really getting into house music. I didn’t think it was like that before. Emma Warren So, in that area – ghetto house, booty bass – who are the people who really do it for you? Sinden I think the pioneers, people like DJ Funk, Godfather, DJ Assault, people like that. A lot of dudes in Chicago are the main people. There are a lot of new kids coming through as well and it’s great now: there are kids in Europe making that music, there are kids in Switzerland making Baltimore club music, in Australia. You can’t really put a location on it any more. Chicago and those American cities are the home of it, but… Emma Warren It was only a few years ago that trying to find a house DJ under 30 was almost impossible. Now it seems this style of music has rejuvenated people into wanting to DJ and play house music again. Sinden And also, getting people into the studio and getting creative, which is good for the scene. Emma Warren You talked about Detroit and some of those guys. Have you played there and is your stuff played there? Sinden No. I don’t know actually; a lot of our stuff crosses over in Baltimore. A friend of mine, Scottie B, has really embraced what we do. He started playing Baltimore club music and house and stuff. Even though he’s a veteran of the scene, he’s really embraced what we do. Same with a lot of people, I’m quite surprised that people don’t really have any hang-ups about playing different styles of music and just doing what they feel. Emma Warren So, you think you’re working in an almost genre-less age? Sinden Yeah, I think so. People have been trying to define what we do, put a genre on it, but I think it’s quite lazy. I don’t think music should be branded and genre-ised. I think the spirit of music now is taking from lots of different places and mixing it up, which is refreshing. Emma Warren Things aren’t really location-specific anymore, you have people in all these different cities in the world making baile funk or Baltimore, whatever, but they’re not necessarily from that place. I guess, that makes for interesting directions for the future. Sinden I think the internet has really helped with that, blogs and the way music is sent around the world. It’s less about record shops and more about finding that music online. The music now is moving so fast, like kids on the other side of the world can be playing exactly what you’re playing that week, but they’re putting their own twist on it and making that music, too, and putting it online. So, you have a good community. Emma Warren Which places online were particularly important for you in getting your music out there? Obviously, there’s MySpace but were there any other blogs or places that were good for you? Sinden I talk with people who run blogs, but usually it’s just that they’ll post tracks of mine. Sometimes the etiquette is that they will come and ask permission, but more often they just post them on site. It’s good. At first, I was a bit negative about it, like people downloading your music, but now I think it’s really cool and it’s really helped, the whole blog scene. Emma Warren It would be good to hear more of your stuff. You talked about Switch before and you’ve worked a lot with him. Can we hear a couple of things that show the breadth of the stuff you do with him? Sinden Shall I play “A Bit Patchy”? I don’t know if I have it. Emma Warren “Gotta Get Up,” maybe? Sinden OK, I’m going to play something which is… Emma Warren Oh, yeah! I told you I had that, didn’t I? Sinden Have you got it to hand, actually? Emma Warren No, it’s on my laptop downstairs. Whatever you’ve got there that would be nice to play. While you’re having a look can you tell us how you and Switch got together? Sinden I was working in a full-time job… Emma Warren What was that? Sinden I was working as a merchandiser for a fashion company, and one day a week I was doing PR for a label called Front Room for Jesse Rose. Switch was cutting his teeth at the time, producing some records for that label, just starting out and we got on really well. He said one day, “Just come into the studio one day. Even though you don’t have any studio experience, just come in and we’ll jam on some tracks. Bring some samples, bring some ideas and we’ll knock some stuff out.” Emma Warren So, what was he doing with house music that was different to other people? Sinden He was just flouting the rules, just doing these crazy eight-bar, 16-bar [things] where the track would just change direction. I’d never heard that before. Before that house music to me was, I was a bit ignorant, but it was like relentless and didn’t always have my interest. It was quite druggy and didn’t really change a lot, it was repetitive. That’s a good thing, too, there are some good tracks… I’m trying to find this track. Emma Warren What did you like about his music? Sinden I just thought sonically it was crazy, it was amazing. I’d never heard stuff like that before, just the way he had the kick drum sounding, it was so fat and bassy. He had his own sound, it was cool. Emma Warren I think one of the things he does and you do, too, is make stuff that’s interesting sonically, but is also really populist in the best sense of the word. Would you agree? Sinden Yeah, I want our stuff to cross over and be accessible. That’s why we don’t mind just using samples and being cheeky and stuff like that, referencing pop music and old dance records, those kinds of “guilty pleasures” records we talked about. While I’m looking for this track can I play something else? Emma Warren Yes, of course. So, what is it, what’s coming out of the CD case? Sinden Shall we play this Mark Ronson remix? Emma Warren Go ahead. (music: Mark Ronson feat Amy Winehouse – “Valerie” (Count Of Monte Cristal & Sinden Remix) / applause) Emma Warren I think we’re going to hear something on a different tempo now, aren’t we? Sinden Yeah, that was a remix for Mark Ronson, “Valerie.” I wanted to play this because it’s a different tempo and it’s for a British grime artist called Lethal Bizzle. (music: Lethal Bizzle – “Police On My Back” (Sinden Remix) / applause) Emma Warren It’s definitely the big, meaty, beaty, big approach to sound. Sinden That’s a slice of the ghettotech that inspires me. Emma Warren How does that connect with the music you grew up liking? Sinden That’s more of a recent thing; hip-hop is really what I grew up listening to, that and indie bands as well. Dance music came later. Definitely, hip-hop was the soundtrack to my growing up. Emma Warren Have you got the Buraka Som Sistema thing nearby? Sinden This is a remix myself and Count Of Monte Cristal did for a band called Buraka Som Sistema from Lisbon. It’s coming out on Modular. (music: Buraka Som Sistema – “Yah!” (Count Of Monte Cristal & Sinden Remix) / applause) Emma Warren Nice use of the CD stutter there. Sinden Yeah, that’s the running joke, when a CD skips in a record shop people always say: “That’s the new Switch tune, or the new Sinden tune.” Emma Warren It’s like the new extended breakdown. Sinden I suppose, it’s a technique we use quite a lot, the vocal breakdown. It’s been a constant challenge, how to build out of a breakdown. Traditionally, it’s been the fills that get quicker, but now we’re trying to find different ways to make that transition between the breakdown and the verse. Emma Warren So tell me about Hervé, how did you start working together? Sinden Hervé is someone I met through Switch in the studio one time. Him and Switch were working on an EP for Dubsided and we just got on really well, we just hit it off and cussing each other over instant messenger, being cheeky. Emma Warren What good cusses has Hervé got? Sinden He’s really quick, he can just cut me down to the ground, he’s faster than me. Emma Warren So, you started working together. Sinden Yes, we started working together… “Beeper” was the first thing we did, almost a year ago now. We did an EP in basically a week. We both work really fast when we work together, he can turn things out really quickly. It’s a good partnership. Emma Warren So, we’ve got something else to listen to from the two of you. Sinden This is the Estelle mix I was talking about, with the trancey influence. It’s a track that Will.I.Am produced and features on. (music: Estelle – “Wait A Minute” (Count & Sinden Remix) / applause) Sinden Thank you. Emma Warren You weren’t joking about the trance. Sinden I’m not messing about, am I (laughs)… Emma Warren Do you think it’s important as a producer almost to not care about what you’re supposed to do, because nothing’s sacred, is it? Sinden Yeah, definitely. I think it’s very easy to get caught up in that whole dance music snobbery thing. With house music, it’s something that’s always existed… here’s a deep house brigade, or the “You can’t do that, you can’t sample that”-people. I remember once Switch played an ABBA track I gave him, a cut-up of “Voulez Vous,” and he played it at this party in London with all these deep house and disco house DJs. They were all on the forums the next day: “Switch is playing ABBA, he’s shit. What’s he doing?” I was like, “Fuck it, it’s great.” Emma Warren What makes you say that? Why don’t you care? Sinden I don’t know, I just think I’m happy to show my influences and I suppose they are a bit kind of iffy, but I suppose that’s what we pride ourselves on, not really giving too much of a fuck, just doing what sounds right. Emma Warren And is fun a big part of it? Sinden Fun is definitely the biggest part of it, it should provoke the reaction that this is fun music and not something too serious or that you have to think about. It’s something that’s basically going to move your waist and make you let go. That’s what our stuff does, we like to think. Emma Warren So it’s a pied piper rave style: you will get on the dancefloor, you will lose your mind a bit and your arse will follow. Sinden That’s it. Emma Warren I thought it would be interesting to listen to something else you’ve done with Hervé. You’ve got “Tamborzuda” there. Sinden It’s funny you should say “pied piper,” actually. We have an advert in the UK for a theme park called Alton Towers and this bassline sounds a little bit like the advert for that theme park and the breakdown is 2 Unlimited-esque. (music: Sinden & Count Of Monte Cristal feat MC Thiaguinho – “Tamborzuda” / applause) Emma Warren So what is it about 2 Unlimited, Snap!, early Prodigy that we’ve forgotten was so good, from your point of view? Sinden I don’t know… that’s a very good question. Maybe it’s the synth sounds they use, and also the simplicity. Sometimes we can get too complicated and think about things too much and make the music complicated, but really it should be about hooks, and some of the best tracks are just about simple drum beats and something very subtle that kind of changes. Emma Warren So, there’s lots of stuff from that part of music you’re taking. Obviously, there are lots of other things, too, but are you ever going to go so far as bringing back the cheesy rap? Sinden What, Morris Minor And The Majors? Roland Rat? (Laughs) Emma Warren Like “Rhythm Is A Dancer,” you know, the cheesy raps you used to get in the middle of rave records. Sinden Yeah, I could do that, me and Hervé. Emma Warren I’m not sure it’s entirely advisable, I don’t really want to be responsible. That’s one element of that era that’s thankfully been consigned to history. Sinden Yeah, hip-house. Some of it’s good, but some of it’s a bit… yeah. Emma Warren Hip-house isn’t the problem so much as dance music with the “here comes the cheesy rap bit.” One technical question: how do you and your production partners get your bass sounding so big? Sinden Basically, a lot of production techniques. It’s difficult, really. Hervé is definitely the man with basslines, he’s more technical than myself. We take it in turns to make the melodies, but Hervé’s the wizard in the studio who gets all the compression right. Emma Warren So, as a DJ, how important is it for DJs who maybe don’t have the most studio experience to work with partners who can get the sounds out of their heads and onto CD? Sinden That’s advisable, I started off as a DJ who then got into the studio and started making music. I still think I’m learning, I’ve only been doing it a couple of years. Switch was instrumental in bringing my ideas out and making them sound good. I think now it’s more accessible… music programs are cheap and home studios are very inexpensive. What I work on is very basic: monitors, Logic, a USB keyboard and plug-ins. It’s so much easier now. Emma Warren Are collaborations important? Sinden Collabs are good. Emma Warren Collabs are good! I feel a cheesy rap coming on. Sinden You can bounce off the other person much better and when you get stuck, the other person can come in and listen to it with fresh ears. Sometimes, when you’re in the studio, and you’re struggling over this remix or something, you need fresh ears and a second opinion. Hervé’s really good, him and Switch both, we all complement each other. Sometimes he’ll play a bassline he’ll look at me and go, “Is that good?”, and I’ll know that’s the one. If it’s a little bit borderline, it’s good to have that second opinion. Emma Warren And how important is going to the pub? Sinden Going to the pub is really important, that’s where all the best ideas come from. That’s where “A Bit Patchy” came from with Trevor Loveys, on a drinking binge (laughs). Emma Warren It’s a silly question, but it’s a serious question as well. Making music isn’t always about being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week and looking into the blinking red lights. Sinden Definitely. It’s not the most inspiring place, the studio, it’s often quite dark and underground. All the best ideas are hatched through going out. It’s not even contrived, we’ll just have a chat and we’ll get onto music that we’re into at the moment or what’s inspired us in the past. It’s more natural: good music made in collaboration comes out of friendship and having a good connection. Emma Warren Have you got something else to play that will show us a different side to you. But while you’re looking, maybe I could ask you a little bit about Southend, which is where you’re from… Sinden Southend… yeah… Emma Warren If you think about where London is in the UK and you follow east, through the East End you end up in Southend… Sinden Yeah, if you follow the Thames all the way east, that’s where Southend is, on the seafront. Emma Warren It’s got quite a specific culture, hasn’t it? Sinden Yeah, it’s guys who dress up in Ralph Lauren shirts and gel their hair and wear tight trousers and loafers and drink loads of beer and go to sticky-carpet clubs. Emma Warren I’ve never been there, but a lot of grime MCs go there on day trips… Sinden I’ve heard about this… why? Emma Warren I don’t know why. It’s kind of a grime day trip… and the other thing I think about is kids in arcades… Sinden Yeah, there’s a big arcade culture. We have one theme park that’s not very good… Emma Warren So, is it the kind of place you need to embrace and get what you can out of it, or is it the kind of place you need to get out of? Sinden I think it’s the kind of place you need to get out of. It’s quite an unlikely location for music, although, saying that, it’s got a really good history. Now it’s a hotbed of bands, like The Horrors, and it was good in the ’70s and ’80s for soul and jazz nights. Emma Warren It was definitely on that soulboy scene. Sinden Yeah, a lot of people would come from London for soul weekenders… I guess it’s got a good culture, but I’d always bemoan its lack of decent nights. Actually, drum & bass was really big there – that was exciting. On Southend high street there were three shops specializing in hardcore, UK breakbeat stuff. Emma Warren Which bit of hardcore? Sinden Jungle. I got into jungle and drum & bass and going to under-18 raves… I first got into drum & bass through the Metalheadz label, Alex Reece “Pulp Fiction,” that kind of thing… That man over there, Zinc, he was responsible for quite a few tunes. I was getting into the jump-up stuff too… So, we took the boy out of Southend, where’s the Southend in the music? Sinden I don’t know, it’s somewhere in there. Emma Warren Sometimes you don’t think that way about your music, but is there anything that connects it to where you grew up or what you listened to? Sinden That’s difficult. The hip-hop influence is always prominent, no matter what music we make, it always goes back to hip-hop. It might not be instantly recognizable, but it is in there. Emma Warren So where’s the hip-hop in the music? Sinden The hip-hop is in a lot of the drums we use and we’ll cut up the lyrics; we’ll make a house tune but we always put some hip-hop in there, just to get me interested in it. What I want to do is fuse dance music and hip-hop, because that’s not happening enough. When I was growing up people were into hip-hop or dance music, and it never really crossed over. That’s happening more now. Emma Warren So we’ve had nu rave, maybe now we’ll have nu hip-house. You’ve described yourself as a big hip-hop head. Who was it in hip hop, who really did it for you? Sinden Public Enemy, they had the rage and the image was striking and bold with the S1Ws, and the way Chuck and Flavor combined together, it was great. Hip-hop was really exciting for me, growing up in Southend in sleepy Essex, and then Public Enemy come along and blow your mind with this angry, hard hip-hop… Emma Warren It’s easy to forget or not to realize quite how alien that sounded at the time. I remember the first time I heard Public Enemy, thinking, “It’s not that I like it, that’s not really the feeling I’m getting from it, but I’ve never heard anything so alien and strong and powerful and mad in my life and I need that…” Sinden Sonically, it just bombards you, sounds coming out of everywhere. I heard they’d go into the studio and all play different instruments and record it, then just take one little bit of what they’ve heard. Basement Jaxx told me they do that as well, they’ll all play instruments at once and they’ll find something interesting from the session, that’ll be something they’ll run with. It’s just a cacophony of crazy sonics. Emma Warren So, Public Enemy were a big influence for you, who else is in your box of hip-hop records? Sinden A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Native Tongues thing. Jungle Brothers were big, BDP and KRS-One. I wasn’t so much into NWA. and the West Coast gangsta stuff, although I got into that later, but more the New York Gang Starr, DJ Premier stuff. Emma Warren Then, moving on from hip-hop, was old-school UK garage an influence on you? Sinden Definitely. Emma Warren Was it something you were actively into or something you just kind of liked? Sinden I just liked it really, the heavier stuff. Not so much the light, skippy vocal stuff, more the bassline-oriented stuff. Emma Warren So less “Sweet Like Flowers”? I mean “Sweet Like Chocolate.” Sinden “Flowers” was the other tune. Emma Warren Brrrrp! I just mashed it up. (Laughs) So less of a Sweet Female Attitude, more Benny Ill. Sinden Benny Hill? Emma Warren Ill, Benny Ill! Sinden Oh, yeah! Horsepower Productions, I thought you said Benny Hill. Yeah, I was into the early Tempa stuff, that whole South London Big Apple thing, Bingo, those kinds of records. Yeah, they were big. Emma Warren What did you like about them? Sinden They had a really good swing about them, they had energy and were really direct and the tempo was good as well. I always find drum & bass quite hard to digest, but that was a tempo I could move at, the 130 tempo. Emma Warren I guess you don’t have anything in there to illustrate the kind of garage you’re talking about, but what would you suggest people check out? Sinden Good question. Emma Warren Sorry to slightly put you on the spot. Sinden Wookie, actually. I’d go to a night called Twice As Nice sometimes back when that was happening and the end of the night they’d always play three or four Wookie dubs and that was the highlight. Wookie’s great. Emma Warren And what was the Wookie cut for you? Sinden It’s got to be “Scrappy,” that was the one… blew me away, amazing. Emma Warren I almost asked you to do me the bassline there, but I won’t… Have you got something else you can play us that brings us up to date, something that you’re working on? Sinden This is for a project for V2. It’s an old Latin boogaloo project, like ’60s Latin jazz, and they’re putting together a compilation, and they asked me to remix “Fever” by [La Lupe]. Emma Warren Interesting… (music: La Lupe – “Fever” (Sinden Remix) / applause) Sinden That was quite interesting, I thought I’d approach it in a different way. With a project like that people will, more often than not, just sort of update it, like with extra drums and a synth line. But I wanted to completely deconstruct it, take the vocal and put it in a completely different arena. Emma Warren So artistically, is irreverence an important part of what you do? Sinden Definitely, just have fun with it. The best results are when you’re really having fun with a track. When you’re slaving over it and not having fun, that’s when it gets a bit dry. Sometimes the decisions you make over remixes can backfire; if you’re not into the track then it’s not really advisable to remix it. If you’re having fun with it and you’re into it, that’s when you got the best results. Emma Warren So, you have a follow-your-feet attitude to it. Sinden Yeah, follow your head and your feet… Emma Warren You’ve got something else to play us now, haven’t you? Sinden Yeah, this is a guy from Sheffield called Toddla T, who’s making dancehall and this is the Count and Sinden remix of “Inna De Dancehall.” (music: Toddla T – “Inna De Dancehall” (Count Of Monte Cristal & Sinden Remix) / applause) Emma Warren That sounded heavy. I like the slowing down bit. Sinden Slowing down is the new speeding up. (Laughter) Everybody’s going to be doing it soon, it’ll go from 130 down to 5bpm. Emma Warren That will fit that kind of underwater dancing thing you see people doing. Audience member [Inaudible] Emma Warren I wasn’t going to say that but you said it for me. Doesn’t matter, let’s talk about your DJing style. You’re CD-only, right? Sinden Yep. CDJs at the minute, I’m thinking about using Serato for CDs. I’m resisting using Ableton at the minute. I know Switch started on Ableton but now he uses CDJs. Hervé and Trevor Loveys are Ableton users, which is good, you can get good results off every format you use. Vinyl is still good, Serato is good, I’ve seen people use CDJs incredibly, it’s basically knowing your tool. Emma Warren So who’s brilliant on CDJs? Sinden Erol Alkan is amazing, he’s got his loop points and the way he’s playing with the wide pitch, the feature on the CDJ Mk III means you can go from zero bpm all the way up to 200. He’s really creative with loop points. Emma Warren So what do you think about that vinyl-is-best school of thought? Sinden I think vinyl is still really valid, and if you DJ with it and you’re really tight, that’s awesome. I don’t think it’s necessarily the case that computers are the way forward, it’s all about how you use them. You can have a computer and DJ off Ableton, but if you’re just mixing as I would be doing off a CDJ there’s no advantage to doing it. But if you’re doing it really creatively and bringing something new it’s good. Emma Warren Obviously, there’s the easiness of carrying them. Are there any other reasons why you use CDs and not vinyl? Sinden Because a lot of the tracks I’m given are CDs. A lot of the promo companies are mailing out CD instead of vinyl, and a lot of the tracks I make I can just burn onto CD. It’s the ease of having your laptop wherever you go, taking it onto a plane, having it ready for the club in the same evening. Emma Warren I like the way you spread everything out, you’ve got your own little messy table on the side of the decks. Sinden I’m really, really messy… I should be more organized. Emma Warren Everyone has their own style. Sinden I like feeling at home when I’m DJing… taking my shoes off, having a cup of tea. Emma Warren Maybe you could put that in your rider: I need a sofa, a comedy pillow. I think we’re coming to the end. Start thinking about any questions you want to ask Sinden and don’t forget to use the mic. Otherwise people watching afterwards won’t have the benefit of hearing your brilliant questions. Before we do that, we should talk about the label you run with Switch. Sinden The label I run with Switch is called Counterfeet. We got off to a very slow start and had, like, one release in one year. Emma Warren That’s very relaxed. Sinden Yeah, that’s very relaxed. Then we signed a group called Radioclit, one guy from Sweden and one from France, and we’ve done two EPs from them, one of which is in the shops. And one Count Of Monte Cristal EP, and one we did together. It started off as a bootleg label, and we were just going to do mash-ups. Then we decided that wasn’t the best way to do it and we wanted to promote music, whatever style that would be, just a platform for our productions. Emma Warren So, have you got something you can play us from Counterfeet? Sinden This is the new track by Radioclit, “Divine Gosa,” and it’s actually a beat for the Bonde De Rolê’s new album and this is a remix by a kid from Paris called Brodinski. (music: Radioclit – “Divine Gosa” (Brodinski Remix) / applause) Emma Warren So, one final question from me before we open it up to everyone else. You’ve mentioned a few different people you’ve liked over the years. If you could get one person to make a tune in your style, be it Aphex Twin, Bomb Squad, Wookie, who would it be? Sinden Very tough question, definitely not someone from a dance background… I don’t want to pass on that question either. Emma Warren Maybe you can marinate on it. So, who’s got the mic, who’s got a question? That was a bit “Who’s got the poison, who’s got the remedy” wasn’t it? I’m heading toward a cheesy rap that you don’t want to hear. Sinden You got a career in hip-hop (laughs). Emma Warren So not (laughs). OK, so, any questions? Audience member I was just wondering if you listen much speed garage and what kind of influences you’ve gotten from that or artists that you listen to in that kind of genre Sinden Yeah again, I don’t know who to say really. I think it’s more a sound. I’m trying to pinpoint certain artists. I’ve just gone blank. You should check out, if you’re into speed garage, the whole kind of bassline house stuff. Back home, it’s very big in the north of England, and it’s like the new speed garage for this year. It’s very sort of bassline-led house. Emma Warren The bassline house thing is quite intriguing because I’ve been trying to find an in, to find what I like in it, personally. And I haven’t found my in yet. What should I be checking out? Sinden There’s a few people. Check out Dexplicit, who you know of. T2, who’s got a big tune called “Heartbroken.” DJ Q is a good person to check out as well. Emma Warren T2, “Heartbroken”? Sinden Yeah, massive record. DJ Q as well. He’s a 1Xtra DJ. Umm… but the tracks are few and far between. For me the production values aren’t always there. I think it’s still growing. Emma Warren This is some interesting stuff there. Sinden Yeah, some good stuff there. Check out that Niche 4/4 stuff. Emma Warren What’s the show on Rinse? [Inaudible comment from the audience]… Wednesday afternoon for some bassline house on the internet [Rinse FM]. [Inaudible comment from the audience] Cool, cool. We’ll be checking it out. [Points to audience] You’ve got a question? Audience member I was wondering what you call your music? Because I know you were on the cover of Mixmag, I think. Sinden DJ [magazine]? Audience member Yeah Sinden I heard a good one. I’ve heard waistline house the other day [laughs]. Emma Warren Well, that’s better than wasteman house… Sinden Yeah I don’t want to be associated with wasteman house. I mean, people have tried to categorize it as fidget house, which was a deliberate move by Jesse Rose to start up media attention. And then I’ve heard crunk house. I’ve heard all kinds of different things. I don’t really call it anything. House, I suppose, used to be a bit of a dirty word. But I don’t think really it has a sound or name. Emma Warren OK, any other questions? Who else? [Waits for a response] Oh we’ve got a question. Audience member I’m just curious to know what sort of indie rock bands you’ve been working with or would like to work with. You were saying that you wanted to do more stuff with bands... Sinden I want to definitely. Audience member But are there any specific bands that you’re into right now? Sinden I heard a good band recently that Erol put me onto. I don’t think they have a deal yet. They’re called Late Of The Pier. Have you heard of them? They’re really good. I suppose they’re the favorite stuff that I’ve heard recently. But keeping up with bands is another thing to listen to. Like I really should do more research with bands. It’s hard enough keeping up with dance or hip hop… Emma Warren Yes, it’s a 24-hour job. So, I guess we should start wrapping up. Have you got anything to play us out with? Sinden DJ Reckless. Emma Warren DJ Reckless on Rinse FM on the internet. Sinden I’m gonna do a remix for a band actually. Since we’re talking about bands. They’re a band from Liverpool called To My Boy. It’s coming out through XL. (music: To My Boy - “Model” (Pull Tiger Tail Remix) / applause) Sinden Thank you. Emma Warren So, really, all that’s left to do now is say thanks to Sinden. Sinden Thanks for having me.

Title: Sir Mix-A-Lot

Sir Mix-A-Lot
To many, Sir Mix-A-Lot is best known for his booty anthem “Baby Got Back.” But as this talk at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy in his home town of Seattle reveals, he is a real-deal hip-hop pioneer. Here, he looks back on his early partnership with Sea Town legend Nes Rodriguez, his breakout moment and how a well-known music-industry figure in ripped jeans and a beat-up Dodge helped him hone his image, a persona that would later lead him into the trap of making music for money rather than love.
Hosted by Monk One Let’s get into it. Sitting to my left is the most legendary hip-hop figure in Seattle, Sir Mix-A-Lot. Everybody give him a big hand. [applause] Sir Mix-A-Lot I’m glad you said “in Seattle.” Monk One We could have said West Coast, we could have said a lot of things, man. I think, speaking as a New Yorker, Seattle was put on the map by yourself. But there was a lot that went on leading up to it. Can you give us a little background about where you were coming from? Sir Mix-A-Lot Back in the early ’80s Seattle had a hip-hop scene but it was a midget version of New York. Everyone was trying to be like New York; cats with the hoodies, brick rings and the big belt buckles, Kangols, we had no identity. I just made up my mind, I’m not going to have a hit record by trying to imitate New York. So, I just did some weird stuff… completely retarded… it really wasn’t talent-based, it was just trying to find an angle. The music scene was kind of strange, it was divided at the time. You had the rock scene, which was always solid because of Hendrix, you got the Dave Matthews, Nirvana, Junior Cadillac, but hip-hop was still virgin. So, you had a bunch of cats, we were all battling, I used to run into other cats’ parties and DJ and cut-up and blow their speakers out, just trying to get attention. In about ’85 I decided to do a record, not to make money but because I wanted to scratch my own voice. “Ooh, I get to hear myself on a record.” So I met this cat named Ed Locke, another called Greg Jones. We put some money together and did a totally underground project but without saying “motherfucker” every other word, so it was underground sounding but it wasn’t underground music. We released it and got in vans to go all over the country, did free concerts and the rest is history. Monk One Going back a bit you were saying the scene was influenced by New York. Down in LA there was a lot popping off there, like Uncle Jamm’s Army and Egyptian Lover. Sir Mix-A-Lot You’re showing your age, man. You had the LA scene that was further along than Seattle, they were trying to come up with their own thing at the time. You had cats like Egyptian Lover, Uncle Jamm’s Army, World Class Wreckin’ Cru, which featured Dr Dre, Ice-T, cats like that trying to come up with something down there, mix up their own gumbo. Then gangster rap was born when Ice T did 6 ’N The Morning, and that’s when the West Coast really did something. Monk One How much of an influence did that have in Seattle? Sir Mix-A-Lot Major, major. You could watch the transformation. People in Seattle started being comfortable being from the West Coast, early on you had cats talk with an accent, “Yo, we’re from New York,” wearing fat laces, though I still wear fat laces to this day, but that’s another thing. But you had cats trying to rock fat laces and be NYC and LA made us feel comfortable about being from the West Coast. It was okay to talk about palm trees and cars because that’s what we do. So, it definitely influenced a lot of what I was doing early on. Monk One Did you get on the radio back then? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, I had a partner called Nes Rodriguez, he was a DJ who used to travel back and forth to New York. Keep in mind I was broke, I’m talking about poorer than poor, we call it “po’”, “p-o”. I had no money and I met this guy at a party, I was kind of jealous of him, but he took my stuff and put it on the radio. It was interesting because I’d never been heard by anyone bar me, my brother, my mother and my sisters. I thought they were going to diss me, but they requested it, they started liking it. I developed a sort of radio personality, that’s where I got my delivery from, being a radio DJ. I used to just holler [shouts] but then I saw him and it has [affects a deep radio voice], and I was, “Oh, shit!” I got my delivery, everything about me came from my early years with Nes Rodriguez. Then I started meeting heavier rappers like Boogie Boys, cats like that from New York were coming out to Seattle to do shows and coming up to the radio station. So, I got to vibe with them, find out these were all real people doing music because they loved it, which is the way we all start. Then it changes, but we’ll talk about that later. Monk One So Nes is Nasty Nes? Sir Mix-A-Lot Like a god up here. Monk One Can you talk about his background and place in things up here? Sir Mix-A-Lot Nasty Nes and me went to school together. He was a little older than me, he graduated a couple of years before. He was a thug. When I met Nasty Nes he had a joint in one hand and a switchblade in the other. But he loved music, that was the thing we had in common, but I hadn’t found myself yet musically. He got signed to KFOX, which was an AM station back in the day. Hip-hop wasn’t really on the radio yet, he was the only one, and he had a show called Fresh Tracks, and he would fly to New York, go through the crates and buy used records from New York and bring them back and play them on Fresh Tracks. That really turned the city on, that’s when the kids were really rocking hip-hop, that’s why he was a god. He literally brought hip-hop to the masses in Seattle, he opened it up. Monk One And he would include your own original productions in the mix? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, I had a little four-track cassette deck and I used to make songs. And I didn’t have a vocal booth, obviously, so I would take a wool blanket, a little mic stand and put the blanket over my head to get the silence. I’d be sweating like hell when I got out. He would play this stuff. The sound quality wasn’t the same as Run DMC or Doug E Fresh, but people still felt something. It wasn’t New York, it was something for us, by us. Monk One You were representing Seattle, it was something they could latch on to. Sir Mix-A-Lot It wasn’t until 1986 that I could feel comfortable doing it. Then I said, “You know what? I’m going to do an anthem.” You had LL Cool J talking about Queens and everybody’s talking about Brooklyn and money-making Manhattan, but I said, “What about Seattle?” Back then, it was different for those of you who go out driving, we used to hang out on Broadway at Dick’s Burger Spot, get high and knock chicks, that’s all we did. So, I thought I’m going to do a song about it, it was like an anthem. I’d never been out of Seattle and, all of a sudden, I’m getting requests to play Phoenix, Arizona. I had no record out yet, this is just selling tapes out of my house for $10. We go down to Phoenix and play a club by Dick’s Burger Spot on Broadway, and I realized they had the same scene as us. I stumbled on my first hit. I thought Broadway was just a Seattle street. Monk One That was “Posse On Broadway”. Sir Mix-A-Lot “Posse On Broadway”, released in ’87, sold almost two million units so far, still sells. Monk One And what label did that come out on? Sir Mix-A-Lot That was Nastymix Records, formed by the two gentlemen I mentioned earlier, Ed Locke and Greg Jones, and it was named after Nasty Nes and myself. Monk One And were you happy with the deal that was structured back then? Sir Mix-A-Lot [Laughs] Keep in mind I knew nothing about the record business, and anybody in here knows the difference between doing music because you love it and doing music for profit is night and day. Initially, I just wanted to do records, I didn’t care about the deal. You give me a deal and I’ll sign it. Initially, I was happy. Later on, I learned about publishing and copyright, how it’s to be used and not used, mechanical royalties, things like that came later. I found out about $600,000 I was owed but hadn’t received. It got a little ugly. I guess, I could blame him, but I don’t think he knew either. I think we all went into it blind and didn’t understand the business. Monk One How long did Nastymix last? Sir Mix-A-Lot We started it in about ’84/5 and it went through to about ’92/93. I left in ’91 and signed with the great Rick Rubin. Monk One How did that happen, did he approach you? Sir Mix-A-Lot He approached me but he did it slick because he didn’t want to be caught for tampering. He had his secretary call Nastymix and say they were Source magazine looking to do an interview. I’m thinking, “Man, Source magazine!” And she says, “Hi, this is Heidi from Def American.” I’m thinking, “So what? I want to talk to The Source.” And she said, “Hold on, somebody wants to talk to you.” This guy comes on the phone, talks real short, “Hey, Mix-A-Lot, Rick.” “I don’t know no Rick, dude.” “Rick, Rick Rubin.” “Get the fuck out of here.” Rick Rubin, for those of you who don’t know, that’s LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, he was the man, him and Russell Simmons. He told me he started his own label, there was no more Def Jam for him, he was doing his own thing. He had Def American. I still didn’t take him serious. He said, “Why don’t you come down to LA and meet me? I hear your deal’s falling apart.” My manager and myself, we fly down to LA and he picks us up in this, I’m not lying, a ’69 Dodge. He’s got holes in his pants and I’m like, “What are we doing down here?” He sits us down in his room - and this is what I’m talking about when I say doing music for love, not profit - and he breaks out these ink blots of different artists. And there was one with this clock and I said, “That’s Flavor Flav.” And there was another with these cats wearing Kangol standing sideways, and I said, “That’s Run DMC.” He had one of myself and I didn’t know who it was. He said, “There’s your problem, you’ve got to discover yourself. You’ve got to make something of yourself and put it out there to the masses, you’ve got to create an image.” That’s where the hat and the furs came from. It was a video I’d done called “My Hooptie”, with the pimp hat, with the big furs. And he said, “That’s it, that’s you.” It was cool at first but after a while it hurts. “Why am I doing this? Am I doing this just for the money?” You start questioning your love and your loyalty to it. Monk One So, it was difficult after a while to be comfortable in that image after a while? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, because we did “Baby Got Back” and people started to expect something. I had guys walking up with their girlfriends, turning her round and saying, “Yo, has she got ass?” I’m like, “Dude, I’m not the ass doctor.” [Laughter] That was cool for a while but then you get into the next album and you want to try something artistically different, you want to grow, but the label doesn’t want you to grow. “No, no, no, give us more of “Baby Got Back”. We’ll take “Baby Got Front”, “Baby Got Side”, whatever you can come up with that we can stay in this box.” If you only do music because you want to make money, you’re fine with that. But I love music, so that was why after one more album I asked to be released and a lot of people thought I was committing career suicide. But sometimes you’ve got to look in the mirror and ask yourself: “Am I doing this just for the check?” And I realized I was doing it for the check, so I pulled out again. Monk One What kind of advice would you give to someone starting out on that path? Is it possible to find a middle ground? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, it really is and I would say to any artist when you’re just signing your deal, give them what you are initially. What I did is say, “I’ll make a little package of all my commercially viable records and I’ll give this to them and they’ll go, “Yeah!”, and it worked, but I held back all my “Hip-Hop Soldier”, “National Anthem”, all those songs that won me respect in the hip-hop community, I held those back from Rick Rubin, he had no idea about those songs. All he knew was the pop songs, so I would tell any artist, “Be what you are going in the door and you can stay that way.” That’s why I love The Roots, Lauryn Hill… even Metallica. I was into their stuff way back in the day, like Gary Numan. What I liked about him was he didn’t give a shit whether he had a hit or not, he just recorded stuff. Everybody out here laughed at him, “This guy with the English accent.” I loved him because he was being who he was. The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, Circle Jerks, I listen to all that stuff because it is what it is. I’m not a Britney Spears fan. Monk One You really incorporated a lot of that rock guitar sound. Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, I love rock. I fell in love with it at a concert. I loved it in the early ’80s, late ’70s, but in the mid-’80s it sucked. It was just a bunch of big hair and tight pants. In the mid-’90s I went to see Korn, I think with Limp Bizkit and one other act, and the energy was real – there was a moshpit, sweat, people running into each other. I was like, “That’s music, that’s what it should do to people.” It shouldn’t be about style, who’s got on the biggest jewelry or the nicest necklaces. I can say that without comeback because I’ve been there. I had a chain so goddamn big I could whoop your ass with it [laughter]. My first Benz, check this out, this is stupid. I bought a Benz, brand new, $80,000, back then that was a lot, now you’d get a used one. Brand new silver Benz. I took it over the street and got it painted candy apple red with a gold grill, gold mirrors, gold wheels, two-tone interior, just dumb shit. Then I brought it home and I’m living in the hood. That’s the kind of stuff I was doing. Then, when I went to the show in the mid-’90s, it woke me up. They weren’t about jewelry or money, it was just real. I remember one thing specific watching the group Disturbed, there was a guy crowd-surfing in a wheelchair, and they shouted, “Bring this guy up.” I didn’t know what they were doing. And they said: “You won’t see this at no fucking hip-hop concert.” And I wanted to whoop his ass initially, but I realized he was telling the truth. Hip-hop had become what we used to hate. We don’t see it now because MTV and Clear Channel control the industry now and they tell us that it’s normal. But it’s not, it’s abnormal. What’s real is groups who do music because they love it. These guys now are made, you got cats who can’t even rap, but they got a big chest and they been shot two or three times and that’s how you have a hit record these days. Monk One Back when “Posse On Broadway” hit you were out on tour with NWA, Hammer… Sir Mix-A-Lot [chuckles] That was one tour too. It was us, MC Hammer, Public Enemy, NWA and Stetsasonic, that was one tour, man, you can’t do that shit now. Back then hip-hop was more about togetherness, it wasn’t about the gangster hates the pop, and bear in mind this was pre-“Baby Got Back”, so I’m still new to the game. Public Enemy, that’s where I got all my game from. Chuck D and Ice T took me under their wing and showed me the game. I remember doing interviews and you can overdo your cool. You try to get beeped out as much as you can on the radio. “Yo, I had this bitch, man, and I socked the bitch in the face ’cause she was tripping with her motherfuckers.” Chuck D took me to one side and said, “Yo, you’re articulate, you’re bright. Why are you hiding it?” I said, “It’s true, I do kind of act stupid when I’m on camera.” “Cut that shit out, just be who you are. Relax.” And that’s where me came back into the game. We got blown off stage, I’m not going to lie to you, because I’d never seen shows like that, they don’t do it no more. This is back when Public Enemy had the S1W’s and shit moving around and skits, NWA had the street thing with Crenshaw Avenue, cats really gave up shows, but they were doing it because they loved it. You’re not making money when you do a stage show like that, you’re making a little bit, but it’s not really worth your time unless you love it. Now you got two guys and a cassette deck and they lip-sync. Monk One You went all over the country with that? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, started off on the East Coast, which terrified me because I was never an East Coast artist, but when we got to the South I found my second home. We did some offbeat shows. We come off the tour and had two days off, so I did some shows with Luke Skyywalker. Whooo! Man, he could perform. I learned quickly, never open for a dude that’s got a bunch of naked women on stage. His show was incredible. It’s weird because I was around when hip-hop was born, so to see its evolution, and de-evolution to a certain extent, it’s kinda interesting. Monk One As far as the de-evolution goes, do you think there’s potential for… we had Quest[love] from The Roots up here yesterday and he was talking about the frustrating aspect of being on a major label and trying to break through and at the same time doing your own thing. Are you seeing hip-hop artists who are keeping their integrity while selling? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, there are some artists who are able to and The Roots are an example. But it ain’t easy, because when you do a meaningful song that lyrically has depth and real cool production, labels won’t push it. Right now, is what I call the “kick-and-clap” era. Every track, take your 2000, get a nice group of handclaps, slide them off time a little bit so they “clack” [illustrates with hands] and that’s it [imitates hard beat]. That’s what everybody’s doing now and soon it will go to something else, but it’s really hard when you want to get away from kick-and-clap and say something in a track, the label’s not going to push it. So, when you do your shows you’ve got to push it out there, and that’s hard to do because you’ll piss your pop fans off. “Dude, do ‘Baby Got Back’. I don’t want to hear this shit.” You get a lot of that and you’ve got to balance it. The artists that do it, like Erykah Badu is one that will go, or say a show like Dave Chapelle, here’s my hit but you’re really going to have to dig in your heels and this is what I’m going to do, and you have to give it to them. Monk One Then you’ll get hated by your crossover audience. Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, your crossover audience will curse and you’ve got to give them something. There’s also a divisive side of hip-hop that’s starting to scare me, these “keep-it-real” cats. That can actually stifle creativity. What I mean by that is you’ll never hear me say Will Smith is a sell-out because he was never a gangster. What do you want him to do? Pull on a sock-hat and pull out a nine, dumping millimeters in a motherfucker’s head? That’s not him. That’s dangerous, because just from his acting ability alone he brings attention to hip-hop. So, you don’t want to put him on an island, you want to embrace him. But a lot of cats will draw a line in the middle of this street and say, “If you don’t drink two beers, shoot two people and fuck two hos by track three, you’re a sell-out.” That kind of shit is dangerous, it will hurt hip-hop. You can see people getting away from it now, necessity breeds creativity, so I think it will go back to where it was. Monk One What path have you taken to stay involved in music, be creative and reconcile these…? Sir Mix-A-Lot I hit a wall around 1997, a serious wall. Creatively, I couldn’t come up with nothing. I didn’t know why. It took me a long time to figure out what I wanted and it was because I was trying to figure out what you wanted. It wasn’t from here [points to heart], I was like, “That chick over there looks like she might buy my records. I wonder what she wants.” Figuring your audience out, this demographics shit, and I bought into it. So, when I asked to be released from American, Rick let me go, was cool with it. He owed me another advance and I walked away from probably about half a million bucks, but I found myself again and met another artist, a cat that’s been touring with me forever. I didn’t know he wanted to do a record, his name is Outtasite. I got him to record some stuff and I was giving him straight hip-hop. Around then everyone was doing Tupac sound, West Coast, kind of melodic, R&B-sounding, he didn’t want to do that, “Let’s do some rock shit.” I said, “But you rap.” “So? let’s do it.” So, we did it and nobody had ever done something like that before. He didn’t care about what people wanted, it was just about doing something he dug. That got me out of my funk quick. I started making good music again. I’ve got 40 to 50 tracks at home that I’ll be releasing over the next few years that are pretty solid. Cats are going to be surprised when they hear it. Monk One What else have you gotten into? The ringtone thing is popping off? Sir Mix-A-Lot Rewind this… when you say have I got any advice for artists, keep your publishing. That’s one thing we all let go, and I didn’t do that, thank god. A lot of artists, they sign a deal, someone goes, “Here’s ten songs you’ve recorded, I own 50% of them and here’s a $1 million.” And a lot of people will go for it because they came from nothing. I didn’t do it because of my experience with Nastymix I hung on to the publishing. In 2000, 2001 we started getting phone calls from Universal. We had a co-publishing deal for “Baby Got Back”, but I own 87% of the song and I wouldn’t give it up. Universal said there’s this new thing called ringtones. “What the hell’s a ringtone?” “You call this number…” I said, “Whatever, you go ahead and do what you want to do.” My manager called me, “Dude, we got a check for $300,000, what happened?” “I don’t know, I just told them they could do this ringtone thing.” Holy shit, there’s money in this stuff, so cats are coming back buying old school songs and putting them on their ringers. So, I started doing more of them. I took “Baby Got Back” and made a specific version of it with a rap about this cat answering the phone. But that wouldn’t happen if I didn’t own my publishing. You listen to the stories guys like Little Richard tell; that’s sad because I wouldn’t be here if wasn’t for them, but they don’t own their publishing. Monk One So, what kind of deal would be realistic for somebody starting out if a label approaches you? Sir Mix-A-Lot Anybody in this room that doesn’t have a deal, you ain’t getting all your publishing. There’s an unwritten rule in this game, and I hate the record business in case you hadn’t noticed, that says 25% of your publishing has to go the label, no matter what. Every time I ask why this is, they just say that’s how it is, the label has got to get paid. But the label will not try to take the remaining 75%. We’re so used to getting screwed on this, we call it 100% – we’re just used to it – but 100% of 75% is power and the labels will let you keep that. It’s the publishing companies that will try to take that from you. They’ll come and say, “We really like that new song you’ve got, we’d like to administer publishing on it.” I didn’t know what that meant. Basically, it’s what you’re supposed to do. They’re going to call everyone that makes money on your shit, they’re going to say, “We need that money in.” Money that’s going to come to you anyway, by law you have to get it. The only thing they can really do for you is place your songs in movies, commercials, ringtones, things like that. They’re not beneficial to you at all if they are not performing. Most of them do not perform. They just sit around and, let’s say Starbucks uses your song in a commercial, Starbucks pays them instead of you, they collect that money on your behalf, they take 25-30% of that money, whatever you’ve got worked out, and they send you the rest every six months. Monk One So, 25% of that 75? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, but here’s the good thing. If they’re a hardworking publishing company and they place that song in, say, Charlie’s Angels, the record company, if you re-record it... Here’s the thing, if you have your song in a film, “Baby Got Back,” Rick Rubin will get a piece of it for master use. However, if Charlie’s Angels comes back and says, “Look, we’re offering $200,000 to use that song but Rick Rubin wants $50,000 for master use. We’ll give you $25,000 to re-record it because you own the publishing.” I ain’t supposed to be saying this stuff, but you re-record it, put it out there and you’ll make your money. As an artist, there’s nothing wrong with making money, don’t feel guilty about it, because if you don’t somebody else will. Monk One Explain what you mean when you say Rick Rubin owns the mastering. Sir Mix-A-Lot When I say publishing, it’s your written works, your lyrics. And cats that are producing on drum machines – that’s what I do – don’t think that’s not your music. It is. But the actual master is the recording. So let’s say you take that music, you take those lyrics, you record it, that song is put out by his company, he owns that actual master but you own the written work. So, if Starbucks says, “We want your song, but we don’t want this guy, he wants $1 million, we want him out of the loop. We’ll pay you $300,000.” Which is what you’d get from him anyway, you can then re-record your works, you can change the music a little bit and you own the works, he’s out of the mix. And that’s the difference between master and publishing. I’ve been screwed a lot, so I know. [laughter] Monk One Us people starting out need to know ways to avoid the pitfalls. Sir Mix-A-Lot I learned it from Chuck D, Ice T, Run from Run DMC, these guys gave me a lot of information. When I was growing up I couldn’t care less. “I’m getting a check with more than one zero? This is awesome.” Didn’t matter to me. Monk One You did end up re-recording “Baby Got Back”? Sir Mix-A-Lot A few times. I’ve done it a whole lot of different ways. Yeah, pimp it … what the hell. Monk One And you own 80-something per cent? Sir Mix-A-Lot 87.5%. I own 87.5% on “Baby Got Back” and the album after that, which is Mack Daddy, but everything after that I own it all. I own 100% of those other records. When I did ringtones on “Posse On Broadway”, 100%. When E-40 re-recorded it, 100%. When I did the Target commercial I owned 87.5, they came to me first, then we went to Universal and they cut the deal, which is what they’re supposed to. And they get a lot of money when they’re only getting 13% [laughter]. They’re like, “Goddamn, we got to massage this, squeeze it out.” And I re-recorded it for Target, because when they went to Rick Rubin, he wanted three, 400 grand. That’s the advantage of owning your own publishing. Monk One Is it possible to recapture it if you’ve given it up? Sir Mix-A-Lot It’s hard because a lot of the time they hold it for 20 years and sometimes it’s 20 years after you’ve fully recouped, which is worse. If I give you $1 million up front for your record, and there’s creative ways of showing you haven’t recouped – oh God, that’s a whole other subject, but the clock doesn’t start ticking until I get my $1 million back. That can take five years. You might be talking 25 years before the publishing reverts back to you. By that time you might be on Oprah talking about how poor you are and some other asshole comes and gives you $100,000 and takes you for another 20 years. That’s how bad it is. That’s the business. Monk One So, what happens, when you sign a deal, they are loaning you at a bad interest rate? Sir Mix-A-Lot I used to call it style points. You go out and look really cool, really rich, but you’re living on somebody else’s dollars. Monk One And you have to make that money back? Sir Mix-A-Lot It’s not as bad as it used to be. I saw What’s Love Got To With It where Ike Turner had to go and do concerts and give this up and sell cars. But it’s not that bad. If I give you a $1 million advance for your record, as it sells all that money goes to me, 100%, until you earn back that $1 million. It sounds cool until you look at how they do things, and I’ll give you an example which they’ll never admit. Independent promoter, he promotes, say, on the East Coast. He charges me $40,000 to promote your record. I tell him to send your manager a bill for $200,000. I’m going to give him another $20,000 to tell that lie, so he’s up to $60.000. Now you owe me $1.2 million, not $1 million. That’s what I hate about the business, it’s sad, but that’s what goes on. The payola issues, paying stations to play you, a lot of companies got tagged for that. So what Clear Channel did to get around that, say you go to Chicago, they own the station there, payola is illegal, I can’t give him another $20,000 to pay the big station in Chicago to play the record, those days are gone. But Clear Channel can do is, because they own the radio station, they can say, “You do this show that you would otherwise charge me $20,000 for, for free.” It’s still payola, but the artist gets screwed. These are the things that nobody talks about because if an artist signed to a label talks about it he probably won’t be signed to that label next morning. That’s the kind of stuff you really have to watch out for. Monk One That still goes on. Recently, there’s been a lot of stuff coming out where the artist goes to a station and the station will have a special concert to promote them. Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, Kube Summer Jam, I’m not knocking them, but let’s talk facts. If you go to their Summer Jam, there’ll have one anchor artist, say Snoop Dogg. He’s getting paid. All the other artists are fairly new and have new records. They need radio play, none of them get paid. They get a hotel room and a flight. Each one of those artists would probably be getting $5-10,000 a night normally. Now that’s payola. The record company is basically paying Clear Channel. Now, if Kube was doing this show for the music, it would be free or enough to pay expenses, but they charge $50 a ticket and the artists get nothing. Now, I’m not saying it’s all bad, if I was a new artist and I was going to get heavy rotation, I’m going to do it and I’m going to get rich. I remember when Ginuwine came out with Pony. He played here three times before this record came out and I thought he was getting screwed, but when the song came out it was No 1. So, necessary evil, I guess. Monk One It’s a gamble that radio play will push sales up. Sir Mix-A-Lot I went to Texas one time and did a show, I call them payola shows, the day of the show it was all, “Mix-A-Lot tonight in Houston.” The day after, gone, they didn’t play me again. Now, I’ve got a new tactic. I tell them if they want Outtasite to do a show they’ve got to play his record for a month, leading into the show, then he’ll come down and do it. That’s about the best you can do. If they play it for a month, hopefully it catches fire and once it does they have to play it. Monk One If somebody has the choice, now with the internet and so on, it’s a lot easier to set yourself up. What are the advantages of doing that as opposed to being on a major? Sir Mix-A-Lot The advantages are huge, but the artists haven’t truly figured out how to do it. The internet has opened so many doors but I think we’re all scared of what’s on the other side. But what’s the worst that can happen? You didn’t sell records on Tuesday, but you didn’t sell any on Monday either, don’t worry about it. Success on an independent is very different. If you get on a major and sell 200,000 you’re a failure, which is stupid. But on an indie you go from making a buck a record to $8 a record. You put $2 back into yourself you’re still making $5-6 a record. If you sell 20,000 units, labels notice that, believe me. Linkin Park tried to get signed for years, kept getting turned down. They released their record on the internet. Warner Bros signed them like that [clicks fingers]. Warner Bros didn’t remember that they dropped them before. You could live anywhere, but you move some units they’ll find you. I just signed a deal with Notting Hill in England, he found out about what I was doing and he wanted some of it now. They will find you when you make some noise. If you do it right, the biggest problem we have as artists is that we tend to take the money, spend it, and not think about the next project. The next project comes, “How the hell we going to pay for this?” Well, you might want to sell that fucking Bentley you just bought. If the money is managed right and you’re succeeding on an independent, the majors will come running but you might not want them. If you’re making $7-8 a unit and you’re selling 100,000 every four months, do the math. You’ll go from $6-7 a record to $1-1.50 a record and this independent guy over here is still pocketing a lot of your cash. They do the same with video producers, the video may have cost a $100,000 but they tell you it cost 200. You don’t have to deal with that on an indie level because you control your own destiny. Most successful independent artists don’t go major. The perfect example is Tech N9ne, an artist from Kansas City, probably the best rapper on the planet, his skills are off the Richter scale. His audience is rock solid. He did a show in Seattle a few weeks ago and sold it out just using flyers. He’s making a lot of money and he just turned Universal down. I said, “How much did they offer you?” He said, “A lot, but it wasn’t enough.” That’s the luxury you have when you do it yourself. Back in the day you needed the label to pay for your studio, but we can all use Reason, ProTools. There’s so much stuff out here now we can do it ourselves. So, the only thing they’re good for is promoting the record, and if you can do that even a third as well as they can you make way more money. [applause] Monk One So, what are you using to make music? Sir Mix-A-Lot Ah, the tech stuff, I love that. I’m a button-head, knob-head, anything new I buy it. I use Reason but I don’t really like the drum machine, the sequencer tends to be too robotic. I use an MPC-2000, MPC-3000, I just got rid of my MPC-4000. I got a Roland MV 8000 drum machine. I use ProTools heavy, I’m a ProTools fanatic. I use a lot of Reason. I just bought Serato, which is awesome, I use the CDJ, I just bought the Mackie mixer with the optical fader, I use a lot of synths. Sometimes I buy a synth for one project. I hear a sound that’s just “damn!” and I might buy it just for one track and sell it to the next cat. Or, if I see someone up and coming like I was, sell it to him half price. Anything new is in my studio. I just bought this huge keyboard controller… who makes it? I’m loving that thing. I’ve just sold a vintage Jupiter 8 to Bruce from Nine Inch Nails. I had a Jupiter 6, a Roland Juno 106. I got all this old stuff, even an Elektro-Harmonix vocoder made in the ’90s, that shit sounds wicked. Monk One Are you still sampling? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, but not from records unless they’re sound effects. I had the luxury of coming up in the early ’80s before sampling really existed. I had to make music, make sounds, so when they did come out they only had microphone plug-ins, so we’d use them for sounds, like rocks, dropping shit. Whatever you could come up with you’d use it and it makes your song so much cooler. Nowadays, everybody just buys a Korg Triton and uses them for factory sounds. I’d rather get a sampler and go out and find shit. I put on my Return of the Bumpasaurus album, we had a pond in my backyard and we had these big flat slate rocks. Throw them up in the air, and “Pow!” We’d use that as a snare. I’ll take kick drums and layer up four or five sounds. I’m real picky about that stuff. I’ll use a spectrum analyzer on just about every sample. Monk One What does that do? Sir Mix-A-Lot Say, I want a thick kick, a good short solid thud where I might want my drummer to re-trigger. I’ll get it real hot from about 50hz to 100, then I’ll take the accenting sounds and throw them on the outside, from 100-150hz they have a paper kick. Then, say 50hz on down, I might put a mic to my throat and go [makes beat noise with throat] and you know how frequencies argue with other, I’ll take a big, thick, wide kick drum. I love doing stuff like that. That’s the geek side of me. I’ll work on a sample for two hours. Monk One On one kick drum? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, I’ve got 10,000 kicks. The land of 10,000 kicks, that’s my house. All kinds of kicks, snares, hi-hats… I’ve been working with a lot of drummers who hate pads. I had the Roland V drum kit and they hate that shit. I try to make it as accurate as I can, so I’d go and sample timbre from legendary kits and stuff. Every time I’m in the studio, I was looking at that kit upstairs, “Hmmm, come here man, and I’ll sample it with a mic.” Monk One How do you keep track of everything? Sir Mix-A-Lot Name your samples. I used not to, then you open up a folder that says, ‘Audio files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,’ and you’re like, “Aw, shit.” You sit there and listen to them, so now as I sample them I name them and they’re names that only mean anything to me. Certain types of sounds I give similar names, like if it feels like something that fits, say, house or trance, I’ll name it. “Trance kick blank”. That way you can stay connected. When you have an artist standing over you and you’re working on his stuff, you don’t have time to go [indicates searching through files]. “Dude, I want a kick that sounds like this song.” So I check, “Ah, ‘Watery kick 8’.” I’m a file fanatic. Monk One Are you messing with house or trance? Sir Mix-A-Lot Not really, but a lot of the DJs I work with do. I went to see Chemical Brothers about six or seven months ago, that shit was… whoa! Two cats and a whole bunch of gear. I just wanted to steal the gear and leave. People call it house, but some of it wasn’t. It was like techno, vintage techno from the late-’70s, early-’80s, but they were mixing it up thick. I was digging that stuff. Music is music to me, as long as it makes your head nod. I just don’t like packaged music. “Today we’re going to make a hit record.” I hate that kinda shit. Monk One That’s like the Triton sounds that you pointed out earlier, there’s a lot of hit songs that, if you know this gear, you can point to it. Sir Mix-A-Lot I listen to the radio sometimes, “Ah, that’s Triton snare 5.” And the kick they use. That’s how they sell their music and it’s not like Triton is a bad board if you get into it and make new sounds. But cats don’t like making sounds. I love it, I tweak. I used to take my synth and get into bed with it – my girl doesn’t like that too much. I get the munchies, get into bed and make new sounds. I don’t know what I’m going to use them for and then later on, I’ll be working on a track six months later and think, “I’ve got a sound for that.” What I like about trance is they found a way to use strings. I love strings but if you use them in hip-hop, people are like: “Damn, is this opera?” You’ve got to find ways, that’s why I love Trent Reznor’s production. He takes synthesizers and puts them through guitar pedals… Shit you’re not supposed to do. I love that. Monk One Are there any other producers out there? Sir Mix-A-Lot I love Trent. I’m crazy about Timbaland because he’s not afraid to take hip-hop somewhere. His sounds. Most producers I dig don’t really do what they dig, they do what other people want. So, when I say I like the producer, I guess I’m saying I like what they’ve done that I’ve heard. I like the Chemical Brothers, sonically the way they move stuff around. I love when I put on headphones and you hear stuff center channel go behind you, I love that stuff. We’re not going to be stereo in five years anyway, it’s all going to be surround, everything’s going to be 5:1. You’ll get in your car and it’ll be center channels and rear-staging, front-staging, left, right. I give it five years and I like the fact that some artists are pushing that. Trent Reznor, Chemical Brothers, Timbaland, they’re there already. Monk One Do you have your system up to mix in 5.1? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, but I don’t mix in 5.1 because people aren’t ready to hear it yet. You can’t do both. I did a 5.1 mix in stereo, it sounded like somebody stirring a pot of gumbo. It was horrible. The kicks were gone, just sloppy. But I think everyone will be there pretty soon – 5.1 is the way to go. Monk One So, it seems like there’ll be openings for engineers who know how to mix? Sir Mix-A-Lot Right now there is. I’ve got friends who only know ProTools, that’s it. And they can’t stop making money. Most artists, especially older rock cats, “Where’s the fucking bloody tape?” They don’t put it on tape no more so, they give the money to some whizz kid to track everything on ProTools. Or else they fool the artist. We worked with Quiet Riot on this benefit thing and they hate computers. So, they roll this big tape thing in that’s like 350lb, with these things, you’ve got to get in there and tune every channel. They record everything on tape and then when they leave, they transfer it all to ProTools. They mixed it and then they came in and said, “Oh, that sounds pretty cool.” I’ve always embraced technology. I’ve had ProTools from day one. I think ProTools 2 was the first I had. Even when it’s messed up. I remember when CD turntables first came out, grabbing it and scratching [makes horrible noise]. It was fucked up but they got it together now. Monk One So, you’re saying you got on Serato recently. Sir Mix-A-Lot It takes DJing to a whole new level. I can’t speak for the mixing aspect, but as far as scratching, especially when you’re doing chirps [imitates scratching chirpy noise], when you do it sonically you can have a tendency to drag it back past the start of the cut so you’re cutting air. But with Serato you can just look at the file and pull it back and chirp all day and you look real cool on stage. I dabbled with Final Scratch, which was cool, but Serato got it right. I didn’t even realize it was a local company. Rane did it. I’m hooked on Serato. The new Mackie DJ mixer, I forget what it’s called, but the crossfader, and any DJ knows you can wear the fader out when you’re in the middle of spinning somewhere and the fader goes off on one table and you’ve got to shake it, but the new Mackie has an optical fader so it’s touchless. It doesn’t have a fader pot, there’s no resistor – it’s the shit man, just having a little red light in there. Just looking at the trace, there’s no contacts, which I totally get. I’m also heavily into electronics so I’m itching to take it apart and have a look, but I can’t. Monk One Are you selling your music online for downloads? Sir Mix-A-Lot I was doing it for a little while… I’m totally into it, but I’m not really feeling the whole thing Apple’s doing because the artists aren’t making a lot of money on it. You sell a download for 99¢ and the artist makes a dime or a nickel, that’s ludicrous, that’s silly. And why is Apple doing it? I’ve got five Macintosh computers at my house, so I love their computers, but why is Apple doing it – why aren’t the artists doing it? Monk One It seems like there is more opportunity for an independent to get in and do it. Apple is playing the part of a major and iTunes is the distribution network. Sir Mix-A-Lot Apple is only doing what everybody in this room could have done. If one guy in this room had an idea and everybody in the room had an album, that one guy could put all their albums online and that’s it. It’s the same thing. Yeah, Apple can run commercials during the Superbowl, but I don’t want any artist to look at this stuff and say, “That’s untouchable, that’s unobtainable, I can’t get there,” because You can. Monk One Let’s open it up to the floor. Audience member Why don’t you DJ any more? Sir Mix-A-Lot I used to love DJing. I’m crazy about cutting and scratching, to me that’s like the lost art of hip-hop. The turntables are what the guitar solo was to rock. But man, the shit you guys do now? Oh my god, I was trying to crab scratch yesterday and I was getting arthritis. I still dabble with it but I’m not about to get onstage and use the Mix-A-Lot name try to front like I’m a DJ and put a real DJ out of a job. Because I didn’t like that when I was coming up. You guys do this shit every day. You get guys like Boy George, he goes out and DJs clubs and he ain’t shit. I mean, I could do what he’s doing. To me, that position should be taken by a real DJ, someone who works at the art form, because it is an art form. Audience Member I want to ask you about a famous video that was banned from television because it had some soapy breasts up against a glass window. Maybe you could tell that story for us. Sir Mix-A-Lot One of my pervert people, I like that. Just to rewind, this was my second album, after “Baby Got Back”, sitting in a room with Rick Rubin trying to figure out, how do we get their attention. Of course, every artist, after they’ve had a hit, they want to reconnect with the streets. I was telling Rick,“We got to do something, I don’t want to have just another pop hit and that’s it.” He said, “You have this song ‘Put ’Em On The Glass’, why don’t you do a video to it?” Everybody’s over 21, right? I hope so. “Put ’Em On The Glass” is this tacky senseless song about tits, for want of a better description, and he said, “Why don’t you do a video for it?” I said, “I can’t do a video for that.” “Exactly.” Back then you had a video channel called Video Jukebox, which would play real edgy stuff because they didn’t want to be like MTV. So we did this stupid video, total nudity, we used cars. Back then nobody used cars, I was like the car guy. We had all the cars in the parking lot, topless girls washing cars, total immature stupid stuff. We gave it to MTV because we knew they wouldn’t play it. MTV turned it down, which is what we wanted. So we took it to Video Jukebox with an edited version, with the boobs blurred out. They played it because MTV wouldn’t. So, the song hits, “Put ’Em On The Glass” is huge and we run the commercials saying, [affects big, deep voice] “The video MTV didn’t want you to see,” knowing they wouldn’t play a video with nudity and cussing in it. It backfired in that it hit, the song took off and the video was No 1 on Video Jukebox for two months, but we didn’t have the records. I wasn’t even finished with the album yet. We did it as a joke because we thought it would get banned and we could promote me later as the artist whose videos they didn’t want you to see. We didn’t want to be seen as the pop boy. We didn’t know it would hit and we didn’t have records ready. Boy, you’re talking about embarrassing. We probably lost half a million record sales by not having it ready. But that video is legendary, everywhere I go people are like, “Man, can I get a copy of ‘Put ’Em On The Glass’? Somebody stole mine.” Good question. I didn’t think that would come up. Audience Member You mentioned some new songs we’re going to be hearing in the next couple of years. Without giving too much away, I wonder if you could elaborate on where the sound is going… Sir Mix-A-Lot I’ve been recording some songs myself but it’s been organic. By that I mean I’m not going to sit down and make an album, I don’t want to be the world’s first 50-year old rapper trying to make hit records. It needs to happen organically; if it happens, it happens. But I do have other artists, including this young lady, Tamika Williams. The first thing I notice about her is she’s that big [indicates very small], she’s 120lb and she sounds like an elephant. Soulful, deep, rich sounds and she sings way beyond her years. A lot of younger singers have problems with vibrato, they either sound like a billy goat or they’re totally flat. She has all that worked out. We started with an R&B record, which, to be honest with you, is kind of boring, but that’s what she wanted to do. All of a sudden the guitar player from Outtasite’s group came over and started vibing and they came up with this sound, I guess you could call it Evanescence meets Aretha Franklin, this real soulful, big sound. Full of instrumentation, cool chord progressions and bridges, and it ended up being this alternative R&B sound. We’re going to release her stuff. A lot of labels are interested, my lawyers are going to start shopping her but we have rules. Her album has got to be left alone. That’s one artist, she’s got one song called Black Hood, which is a song about reaping what you sow, basically what you do in life, do you think about the day you die where you have to pay for it. It’s a cool track. Outtasite has been in the business a long time, his perspective is a lot like my own, even though he’s never put out a hit record. Very sharp, deep, and his thing would be Eminem meets Korn, really. He’s very important-sounding, he hates talking about cars and girls, he’s already better than me [laughs]. It’s not his thing. My stuff, I’m all over the place. Some of it’s, like vintage “Posse On Broadway”, heavy bass, knock-your-windows-out. And some of it is borderline rock stuff. I’m letting other people come in and touch it. I love people coming in and a lot of influences, people who aren’t in the music business, I love letting them come in and touch it. ’06 will be crazy, hopefully. Audience Member I also want to ask, a lot of people nowadays are using ProTools. But I guess a lot of us are interested in what you were using back in the early days, the old-school electro influences that we can hear in your music. Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, that’s what I was saying earlier. I use, it’s kind of weird the way I produce. When I go in the studio I have what I call my quick-hit stuff, by which I mean roll in a little Roland MC 909, an XV5080, an old Casio controller ’cause it’s real small, I can sit it on my lap. When I have an idea, I have these little digital voice recorders and I put the idea on that first and I sit down and whatever’s on I start making music on it. I don’t use my old stuff any more because MIDI doesn’t have those multi-timbral features I need nowadays. So I have a tendency to go the old trusty Akai 2000 or MC 909 and make just one four-bar beat and then I start dabbling with titles and feels, and if I get that one wicked title, you get your subject matter, you start writing and then I go back and produce the whole song around what I’ve written. So as far as equipment, whatever’s on, if I see a light flashing I start hitting keys. Audience Member But as far as a song like “Baby Got Back”? Sir Mix-A-Lot Oh, back in the day, I can go way back, when I did “Posse On Broadway”, I always wanted that 808 because I loved that shit. The first time I heard it was, I think, T La Rock and the Beastie Boys’ “Slow And Low” That’s where I got the idea for “Posse On Broadway”. I took an old Oberheim DMX that I used on my first album, Sequential Circuits, I forget what that was called. I had the first Roland Dr Rhythm, old shit I traded in and bought an 808. I turned that as far as it would go, I wanted that drum to last so long I could go for a pee and it was still hanging. “Boommmmmmmm!” I got into that on “Posse On Broadway”, but when I did “Baby Got Back” there’s a lot more techno mixed up in it. I was always into Kraftwerk, they’re the group that got me into drum machines. I wanted to keep that same 808 sound, but the 808 sucks when you MIDI it up, so that’s when I got into the Akai. I bought an MPC60, that’s how I did “Baby Got Back”. I took the MPC60 and synced it up with my Jupiter 8. There’s an old song called “It’s More Fun To Compute” by Kraftwerk [imitates drum pattern]. Listen to “Baby Got Back”, that’s all it was. Then I took the same notes [imitates Kraftwerk – “It’s More Fun To Compute”], that’s where I got the idea from, took that and turned it into something else. Audience Member So what other stuff were you listening to? Egyptian Lover? Sir Mix-A-Lot Oh, yes. We both come from the same school, basically. If you listen to “Egypt Egypt”, which is his biggest song and he’s got the breathing [imitates Egyptian Lover - Egypt Egypt], all that came from Kraftwerk’s “Tour De France”, and when you listen to “Tour De France” it was like this bike [imitates bike sounds]. They were doing all this cool shit; it wasn’t sex but we turned it into sex. And then we’re doing all this breathing and these weird things, they had this sound called pitty-pat in Kraftwerk stuff, this little electronic click and they would make this [drums on armchair]. It made the songs move faster and that’s what shaped the West Coast sound in the early days, the really clean, clinical German techno stuff with the big bottom end we were getting from New York, and that’s where all the early West Coast stuff came from. Audience Member It’s interesting you use the word techno as well because we had Arabian Prince a few weeks back and he was talking about a time when the words techno, electro and rap were all interchangeable. People were listening to Cybotron as much as whatever else. Our generation isn’t really used to that, we have really defined ideas of what techno is and what electro is. Sir Mix-A-Lot Neither had we. Anything that sounded electronic, we just called it techno. Then you had industrial, which was really different. I used to like that because it was different, you had that nasty sound, because the stuff we did was really perfect, the snares were really clean and everything was pristine and bright. Then the industrial stuff came and that’s what gave birth to your Trent Reznors. It had this distorted, murky, kinda saturated, overloaded sound which gave it a real energy. We all feed off each other, I guess, but you got to watch that now, you get sued. Audience Member Have you ever been sued? Sir Mix-A-Lot Oh yeah, I got sued a couple of times. One dude, and I can’t say his name because when we settled we agreed not to, you’ll probably call him to talk one day, I got sued by one guy that actually went and produced the song after I released my song. He listened to my song, went and did his song because mine hadn’t been properly copywritten yet and said, “Hey, I produced that years ago.” And thank god for Roger Linn, he’s the creator of the Akai MPC, he listened to it and he had a way of telling when the files were created and mine were created two years before his. He said he recorded the song in the ’80s, but I don’t want to mention no names. We had some other issues, one of them I lost which was interesting. I paid $100,000, he’s happy. To be honest, we stole the same thing at the same time. We both heard the same thing, interpreted the same way and ended up producing something similar, even though they’re not identical. But you could listen to the songs and hear where they’re both coming from. If Kraftwerk wanted to sue us, they could sue both of us probably [laughs]. That was a pretty fun lawsuit. Once I realized that he was just an artist trying to make it, I said, “Let’s settle.” I didn’t want to crush him, just settle and move on. So be careful how you get influenced. Listen to the feel, not the notes. Monk One Anybody else got something to say? Seattle people? Audience Member You still got any off those tapes you used to sell with “Square Dance Rap” on it? You still have the masters? Sir Mix-A-Lot Yeah, I got a suitcase – this stuff would probably explode if you put it in a deck – of old four-track cassettes. I got these old for-track cassettes and I can’t find a 4-track to play it in. I had some old 24-track stuff, the big two-inch reels, and I put one of those on the deck it tore the heads off, it just disintegrated. But yeah, I got the old masters, the first “Square Dance Rap”. What Jonathan’s talking about is that back in the day I’d record stuff at my house and sell it out of my window to make a little money. I had this track called “Square Dance Rap.” Which was crazy, and I didn’t want people to know it was me because we were mocking country music. I didn’t want people to know it was my vocal because I was talking like this [imitates redneck accent], we took the track and recorded it at high speed and then took it down and did the rap real slow with the accent [imitates slowed down redneck voice], “Sir Mix-A-Lot on the wheels of steel...” And when you speed it back up it was like a smurf and everybody thought it was another character. They thought I just did the music and cut in it, but I did the whole vocal. It was supposed to just be a joke, but the shit hit. So now when I do concerts everybody’s, “Man, you didn’t do Square Dance Rap.” What am I supposed to do, inhale helium? So we do a little intro where I scratch the whole vocal over the top of it. I recorded that song in ’82. Hip-hop was so new then that people were doing dumb stuff. There was some dumb shit out. Rapping Duke, that’s another one. Rapping Duke was a cat that did John Wayne, he did a perfect John Wayne. I thought the dude was white because he was so accurate, but he was black as that turntable. I was like, damn! People were doing anything to get heard because you weren’t going to get radio play so you had to get noticed, so people were stealing TV themes, like Doug E Fresh’s “Inspector Gadget.” You do that now you get your drawers sued off. But you could get away with it back then. I don’t know what the statute is but a whole load of us would be broke if we got sued over that stuff. Audience Member I’m definitely one of those kids that came up on Fresh Tracks and from what I remember it was like a new song every week. Was it that kind of thing? Sir Mix-A-Lot Nes used to go to New York because it was, and still is, the hip-hop mecca. He would have some stuff shipped out that was fresh out of the crate. I remember when he broke the Roxanne battle. It had never been heard. He played the UTFO version and he had Shante doing a cussing version of a response and then the Real Roxanne. He was playing all that shit before it was even heard on the West Coast. You listen to some of that shit, it’s stupid as hell, but back then it was hot to hear all this real underground stuff and Fresh Tracks was a cool vehicle. It was a real shame when they took that away. I’d love to see something like that in every city.

Title: Skepta (2008)

Skepta (2008)
Joseph Junior Adenuga, AKA Skepta, never wanted to be an MC, but in the end it proved to be where he was most comfortable. Growing up in London in a Nigerian household alongside his brother JME, Skepta began as a DJ before moving behind the mic as his brother made his way into the grime scene. Following some work with the Meridian and Roll Deep crews, Skepta and JME founded Boy Better Know and in a few years found themselves travelling around the world on the back of mixtapes, performances and merchandising.
In his lecture at the 2008 Red Bull Music Academy, Skepta recalled his early years in a shared bedroom and how grime emerged from a typical London stew of dancehall and dance music.
Hosted by Emma Warren His name is Joseph. His name is Junior. So welcome to Skepta, AKA Joseph Junior Adenuga. Skepta Yes. [applause] Can I relax? Emma Warren We’re here now. You can relax, we can relax because we’re up for some two hours of in deep grime insight, some really interesting music. And also, some very interesting stuff about the way you as an artist do business, because your Boy Better Know label, empire is an interesting way of doing things. Can you tell us a bit about it? Skepta Boy Better Know is a group of artists, producers, MCs, managers. It’s a group
of everything that makes a group what it is basically. It’s not just one person. We’re all different in our own ways, so it’s the perfect formula. Emma Warren So is Boy Better Know different from the grime crew as we know it? People who are into UK music might know about crews like Heartless Crew or Roll Deep, they might have an idea about what a crew is. Is Boy Better Know different from that? Skepta It’s kind of the same, but with a lot of crews in grime, everyone’s the same.
There are exceptions – Roll Deep are a bit like us, they’ve got a professional
side to it and the musical side to it. A lot of crews in the UK don’t have that the diversity, it’s just one specific kind of thing. We are different, definitely. There aren’t a lot of professional people in grime. But as people get older they start to take it more seriously and see it as a job. There will be more crews coming like us, but at the moment it is really grimy. We try to keep the professional side as well as the grimy side, that’s what makes us different. Emma Warren Two things – you talked about “we.” Who are “we”? Skepta Boy Better Know is me, JME, Wiley, Sam, Shorty, DJ Maximum, Frisco – that’s the
immediate Boy Better Know. There’s five MCs, one DJ and a manager. Emma Warren And can you give us a bit of an idea about what makes you different? Say, if we come and see you play or listen to a JME record, what’s going to be different about what you do? Skepta We’re all in our own psycho worlds. I’m different to JME. He’s – how can I put
it? – into his computer kind of stuff, he’s into a lot of the internet, HTML king of things that I might not know about. I’m a bit more wayward and wild than him. Then you’ve got Wiley, he’s on his own crazy side, Shorty’s on the crazy side, Frisco. We’re all different and when you listen to the tracks you can hear the different kind of ideas we’ve got going on in our brains. Emma Warren JME’s your brother, right? Skepta My younger brother. Emma Warren What happens when you two come together, were there tussles over the kitchen
table about who has this mixtape or whatever? Skepta No, surprisingly me and my brother, obviously there are disagreements, but there’s no
fighting or arguments like that. I think it’s good having JME; he’s my younger brother, but he wants to be better than me and I want to be better than him, so the competition’s always there. We always shared the same bedroom since we were young and the computers in there. So as soon as I get up I want to be
on there making a track. He’ll be in the chair, making another track. It’s
good, I don’t think there’s another brothers-in-grime crew like us two. Emma Warren “Brothers in grime” is a headline that will be used at some point, I imagine. So when you two were growing up, your bedroom must have been a bit of a grime headquarters, because your brother was designing covers for other people, as well as T-shirts, which we’ll also talk about a bit. So picture the scene.
It’s Saturday afternoon around your house. What’s happening? Skepta There’s a lot of smoking going on, a lot of people coming in and out. It’s always been like a studio, my room. People come through, chill, say hello, make songs. It’s just like a studio environment in there. Loud music. When I was younger, my mum and dad used to tell me to turn it down, turn it off. But as I got older they started to realize it was more like a job. It could be anything from 10 in the morning to 2 in the morning, all the way round the clock. It’s just a madhouse at the moment. Even though we’ve moved out of the house, but the computer’s still there, so every time we go back there there’s always going to be loud music. Emma Warren So grime should be grateful you have tolerant parents. Skepta It should be. Emma Warren I think at this point it would be good to hear a bit of music. Can you play us something off your last album, Greatest Hits? Then we can find out something about who you are as an artist. Skepta I think this is the most obvious one people might have heard of. (music: Skepta – “Doin’ It Again” / applause) Emma Warren So tell us a bit about that, please. Skepta Big up Zinc for sorting that out – it sounded like tin. But yeah. That track, it was kinda weird how I made it because when I first started MCing, which was about three years ago... I’ve produced grime for ages but only started MCing about three years ago. I used to go on Rinse FM, which is the biggest pirate for grime in the UK. I went onto Rinse FM with Roll Deep and Wiley, and we used to make tunes on the Sunday and experiment. One day Wiley made a track where eight bars were
different to 16 bars of it. So I went home and I decided to make one like that, where the 4/4 chorus is different to the 16. So I made it, took it to the radio the next Sunday and everyone was going crazy. Crazy, crazy. “This tune’s sick.” I didn’t know what to put on it, but MC Creed, he’s one of the old school connoisseurs of the garage scene, so I thought, “Put him on the chorus and some grime guys on the grimy part.”
At the time I was doing it I didn’t realize it was going to be so big. I made that tune three years ago, but still, Ayia Napa, Malia, every holiday resort, every club in England, that tune still gets the same reaction as when it first came out. It’s a bit weird, sometimes when you make a tune, you might not think, “This is the one,” but it’s what the people say that goes. That’s probably my biggest song to date, along with “Rolex Sweep.” Emma Warren We can’t go much further without talking about “Rolex Sweep,” but one other thing before that. Grime, in its early days, had quite a very different production style to what it has now. There’s been quite a big shift towards the house-y, big, electro-sounding music. How do you think that’s happened? Skepta Now, the charts, ever since T2 and the bassline scene made good vocal tracks,
so the dancing element has come back to the scene. The producer Bless Beats was the guy who made Wiley’s “Wearing My Rolex” and “Rolex Sweep,” so he’s got an electro sound going on at the moment. It’s just one of those things. Music’s always changing in some mad way. All
the dance, electro, funky house, all the dance kinda music right now is really big. It just so happened that Bless Beats made the beats at the time, but a lot of grime artists are doing the electro-sounding things now because that’s the sound right now. I
don’t know how it happened, it’s just mad. Emma Warren But do you also think maybe it’s part of grime expanding and growing up a bit in terms of being bigger? Before, in the early days, grime was quite local, quite small, people knew about it but perhaps they only knew about Dizzee Rascal, he was the only artist whose tunes they might recognise. They knew about grime, but didn’t know it very well. Whereas now, quite a lot of grime artists are having top ten hits in the UK, they’re traveling internationally and playing all over. You were talking about the summer holiday
resorts. So do you think the change in the music is just reflecting the fact that grime is now more normal to people, more common to people? Skepta I think, Europe as a whole, obviously we’ve got so many different types of people, cultures, backgrounds of people and all different types of music. Now grime people are realizing you’ve got to make all kinds of music. Whatever genre of music I make, be it drum & bass, anything, I will always be Skepta, the grime artist. Doesn’t matter if I’m on electro, if I’m on rock. People are looking at themselves as an artist now, before they’d only MC on a grime track. When I got that electro beat, I didn’t think, “I ain’t gonna do it because
people won’t like it.” I just put myself on that track, but give that track a
bit of Skepta, you know what I mean? I think everyone in grime is just waking up and thinking, “You know what? Let me talk to John, talk to Barry, and talk to Dwayne at the same time.” That’s what we do, anyway. You can hear all different kinds of songs on Boy Better Know, like the
“In A Corner” track I just
played that was a bit faster than the grime, than the garage, than “Rolex
Sweep.” Emma Warren So you’re saying now, for you as a grime artist, you want to
talk to John and Barry and Dwayne. Maybe five years ago when you just would’ve been talking to Dwayne, what do you think would’ve happened if you’d said to them, “You know what? In the future I’m going to make this big pop tune, it’s got a dance, that Chris Martin from Coldplay’s going to cover it at a gig, that’s what’s going to happen.” What would this imaginary
Dwayne have said to you back then? Skepta He probably would’ve said I was lying. I came from the street to the music, so
my street mentality still would’ve been there, but you grow up in music. I wouldn’t have thought then that I could do that, but some people that liked me for that mentality that I had would probably not like “Rolex Sweep.” But that’s how I keep it with every single thing – so if I have
“Rolex Sweep” out, I’ll make sure I’ve got a new grime tune that will bust up
every rave. Emma Warren Just before we hear it, I just want to get a bit of a picture from you. If you went to a
typical grime rave four or five years ago, a Sidewinder, what would it have
been like? And now, if you go to a grime party somewhere with maybe more of a
fashion crowd or an electro crowd, what would that be like? Skepta In a grim-y rave, there’s always a dancehall element in there. Everyone’s in
competition, they’re all looking for the biggest crowd reaction. It’s not moody,
but that dancehall vibe is in there. That’s where grime got a lot of its persona from, the whole MCing, reloads, everyone shouting when you say a good lyric. When you go to the more trendy clubs, you can still do that stuff, but you get a chance to do other stuff which might be a bit too far-fetched. The Sidewinder crowd’s a bit young, it’s energetic, people jumping around going crazy. But you go to places where people are more mature, they want to chill out and listen to what you’re saying as an artist and how you are. Emma Warren I think some people might be aware of those Rio favela funk parties and seen some of the footage on YouTube, so can you give us an idea of what you might see at a grime rave if you were a fly on the wall? Skepta If you don’t want to get pushed about and stuff, just stay at the back because at the front it’s a bit crazy. I did a show the other day, some people were trying to rip my
jumper off – I’d just bought it that day as well. Emma Warren So this isn’t about girls trying to rip your top off? Skepta Girls and boys, both trying to pull my top off. I don’t know why the boys were trying to do it. But even in the UK... In London, you can get a bit spoiled for choice. You’ve got Roll Deep, Nasty Crew, Boy Better Know, everything. But when
you go out of London, you don’t always get to see a grime artist, so sometimes it gets really, really wild. I’ve stage-dived, I’ve jumped in the crowd and they’ve held me up and put me around. Emma Warren Where was that? Skepta I did that in London, actually. It’s good, because the energy is there. At the front it’s mad, in the middle it’s a bit more calm, at the back you’ll get [hunching forward with a serious look on his face] the sunglasses-in-the-dark vibe. Emma Warren That’s always a good look. Skepta Hats low, that kind of don’t-step-on-my-trainers vibe. Emma Warren But it’s a good energy, though. Skepta At a grime rave that’s what it’s all about. It would be weird if I was in there and no one was acting like that, because that’s where I’m from. I probably would’ve been there, standing at the back five years ago. It’s good. I like to know that the people I’m trying to reach are coming to these places, but stay at the back if you don’t wanna... Emma Warren Come along, but stay at the back. With “Rolex Sweep” you reached more people
than you had with anything else. Can you tell us a bit about what made you do
it, and then we’ll have a listen? Skepta Obviously Bless Beats, he made the original “Wearing My Rolex.” Ge made a new beat, brought
it to me and Wiley. Wiley said, “Why don’t you do a dance like Soulja Boy and Elephant Man and stuff?” I
said, “No, I don’t want to do that, I just want to MC.” So I wrote the lyrics to the track, I put the lyrics down, then we went out one weekend, got really drunk, made up a dance to the tune and it went from there. But I never, ever, ever, ever would’ve imagined making a track like that. Nothing in my brain makes me think that I don’t know what
I’ll be doing two years from now. That’s the craziest idea I’ve ever had and it’s probably my biggest song of my whole career. It was and still is a big surprise for me how big it is. Emma Warren I think we should hear it and then afterwards, for the uninitiated, tell us what a Rolex sweep is. (music: Skepta – “Rolex Sweep”) By the way, that was so off MySpace that Skepta was actually checking his
messages. Skepta I’m not checking my messages. [laughs] Emma Warren So, first of all, who can dance like you? Skepta No one. It was a bit rude of me saying all those people’s names, I was just having fun with that tune. Emma Warren What is a Rolex sweep? Skepta On “Wearing My Rolex,” Wiley is saying about sometimes you go into a club – you see a girl
you like, and you just give her a piece of your jewelery, so she’ll dance
with it and you know at the end she’s going to find me and we can talk
outside. That’s what he was saying, that’s when he starts, “Promising the
world to a brand new girl I don’t even know yet, next thing she’s wearing my
Rolex.” Then on the next track, on “Rolex Sweep,” the arm on a Rolex doesn’t go tick-tick-
tick, it sweeps around, so we thought we’d make a dance where you sweep your
arm around like that (makes circular motion), so that’s why it’s called
Rolex sweep, I was just gonna make a dance to the arm of the watch. Emma Warren Grime quite likes to kind of wear its wealth on its sleeve, literally, doesn’t it? Skepta Yeah... that’s from the American bling-bling thing. It’s a bit quieter in grime. People have been wearing Rolexes for years, but when we were younger all the people who had money were wearing them and we couldn’t afford them. When I made that song I’d go to a club, people would say to me, “Where’s your Rolex?” I’m not a Rolex kinda guy. I never liked Rolexes, but when I made the track I had to go and buy one. [laughter] Emma Warren They didn’t even give you one? Skepta No, no, I had to go and buy one. But my friend wears it now, I don’t even like Rolexes. Emma Warren Your friends must be pleased with you. So if you’re not a Rolex kind of guy, what kind of guy are you? Skepta I like clothes, really. Clothes, clothes. Clothes. Clothes. Emma Warren OK, so I think we’ve established that Skepta likes clothes. Just tell us a little bit about what the reach was of “Rolex Sweep.” How far did it go? Skepta What, everything? Emma Warren Maybe just a couple of mad things, like say, you’re talking to your auntie and she doesn’t really know what you do. Or maybe you’re in a shop and you said you did a tune that Chris Martin of Coldplay worked into one of his songs. Skepta A couple of footballers, when they score they now run to the sidelines and do the Rolex sweep now. Emma Warren I’d forgotten about that, so tell us who has been Rolex sweeping? Skepta I don’t know. I’ve seen one footballer did it and it’s been seen on football programs. I know Busta Rhymes did it on stage. You know what, “Rolex Sweep,” I actually sat down and counted how many words there are on the track. It’s
21 words. Emma Warren You got 21 words to go. Skepta [laughs] 21 words on the tune, and I’ve been doing music for ages, putting in days and night, falling asleep at the desk, in other songs. But that’s probably the tune where I’ve said the least words. It wasn’t easy to write, obviously I had to spend time working out rhymes and stuff but it’s surprising how that’s the biggest song I’ve ever made. Emma Warren So maybe less is more. Skepta That’s what Wiley says, less is more. Paul O’Grady was doing it with Jane from
EastEnders. Emma Warren Those are British television people, comedians, in both senses of the word. Skepta Sick, sick, sick. YouTube is just flooded with people doing the Rolex sweep, six year old children, big people. Emma Warren You just mentioned Busta Rhymes then. As UK MCing was developing, the UK hip-hop people really wanted to be down with the Americans. A lot of them just didn’t really have their own sound. Obviously some of them did but, as a whole, there wasn’t really a sense of it having its own way of doing things. How does grime relate to hip-hop? What about you? Do you have any connections with American rap artists or do you want those? Skepta I’m 26, so when I was younger, a lot of the music I listened to was hip-hop. A
lot of Biggie Smalls, Tupac, Snoop. We lived the same kind of lives. Obviously
there are ghettos in every country, but I think grime was the first UK
identity where we could say that’s ours, nothing to with rap or hip-hop. So Solid [Crew] still had a bit of hip-hop in them, but
just after them, when it came to Pay As U Go, Wiley and that, I think that was the line where grime was born. We don’t wear baggy clothes or anything like that, so it is really English. Emma Warren I think we should talk about you as a DJ, you as a producer, you as a MC. But before we do that, some people here will know something about grime and some will know nothing. Can we talk about what grime is and where it came from? So if someone, like that guy in the shop or your auntie, asked you what grime is, what would you say? Skepta Grime is England. It’s beats. What it is basically, in Europe we have the real dance vibe to our lifestyle. America is hip-hop, proper hip-hop, but I’ve been everywhere, so many countries, and everywhere I go, even last night when we went to the party, there was a house vibe there. We’re just MCs on that style of music. That is all grime is, it’s MCs, like rap, but we’re rapping on house. Whether it’s garage, house, grimy, funky house, electro, everything. And that’s what grime is. Beats of any speed and it’s a culture in England. Emma Warren And it is a culture;. You’ll be seeing kids at bus stops spitting bars, writing lyrics all the time. For a whole section of the population it’s something that you just do. Skepta Naturally. I don’t think you have to try to do it in England any more. There’s millions and millions of people of all ages MCing. It's a big culture just everyone MCing and rapping. Emma Warren And we should get deeper into that at some point. Anyone who has followed UK soundsystem culture should know roughly where grime fits in. So there’s acid house and rave and hardcore and jungle and 2-step and grime and dubstep and funky and whatever else is going to happen after that. I think we have a sense of where the music’s come from. What about the
MCing, where did that come from? Skepta It came from dancehall artists in Jamaica, first of all. Then it went into the drum & bass era. Emma Warren But the MCs in drum & bass are quite different, aren’t they? Can you give us
an example of what a typical drum & bass MC would do? Skepta He would [pause] I don’t know, I can’t do it, it makes me laugh. Emma Warren Yeah, you can, come on. Skepta No, I used to particularly like
Shabba D. He would do the... [fast
chats], but not all the time, he would do football lyrics, lyrics that would make you think, “Hold on, I could actually write a lyric here.” In England, I believe, it stemmed from dancehall. All that stuff they’d say in dancehall they’re still saying it today in grime. Emma Warren Can we just pause one minute there. I think we need to explain it a little bit for people who don’t know what all this
[fast chats] means. What were those jungle MCs doing and what does it mean? Skepta [laughs] What, break it down? Emma Warren Yeah. Skepta That stuff was just words, it’s like a slick way of saying it. They’re actually saying phenomenon. Emma Warren What about Skibadee and “menomemena”? Skepta Skibadee is an MC, “menomemena” is just a little start before you say
something beginning with an “m.” Emma Warren You’ve just explained something to me I didn’t know. Skepta Like Mickey Mouse, I can say “Menomemena Mickey Mouse.” It went through there,
drum & bass. Emma Warren So let’s just draw the picture in black-and-white for everybody: In jungle there were MCs, but the way they hosted was almost more like stream of consciousness. People weren’t spitting bars in the way grime MCs are. Skepta There were a couple, like Skibadee and Shabba – that’s who I listened to for lyrics. The music’s fast, yeah, so they were just doing what the music’s telling them to do, that’s what I think. The way it’s sounding to them is making them say what they’re saying. I’m really, really into the whole dancehall vibe, so sometimes when I sit down and look at it now, an MC might do something and it reminds me of me, the way he is on the stage, how he might react when the crowd goes mad, I’ll think, “Oh, that’s where I got it from, that’s where this all comes from.” They listen to them. When the jungle thing started, it went
dancehall, drum & bass, jungle. I think a lot of producers in grime could get into it now, because the production in drum & bass is so good, you can’t just do it, you can’t just make drum & bass music because it’s layered so many times. A lot of young people don’t have the time or capacity to start thinking of filters and stuff. Emma Warren Though we’ve got some drum & bass producers in the house. Skepta I respect them so much because they put a lot of thought into the music. When jungle came out, a lot of us thought, “That doesn’t sound as complex as the drum & bass, that sounds good.” Then the MCs were with it as well; then, somehow with the garage thing, people started to slow it down and MC on the garage. Then people went back and slowed it down, then grime was born. Emma Warren So let’s stick with 2-step and garage for the minute. What was your relationship with garage? Skepta That’s when I was a DJ, I used to like the tunes. I liked the Heartless Crew, they were the turning point in the UK for the whole MC-based music there is now. When Heartless came out, Bushkin and Mighty Mo were the best MCs, they were just like vibes. Emma Warren All the way through this soundsystem culture music production was improving, people were learning how to do new things and people have always been able to do new things on very limited technology. But you can see how that worked. Can you see a point in the progression of MCing where suddenly the bar was set up extra high
in a way that helped all this other stuff happen? Skepta I think it was Shabba, from the jungle days, when we could listen to it. That era there is probably the point when everyone thought they could write a lyric too. Emma Warren When are you talking about? Skepta The jungle days. Every man, dog, wife had a lyric. And most of them were copies of his. They’d say, “Listen to my new lyric,” and it was just what Shabba had said on radio last week. It was a tidal wave of everyone MCing at the time and it wasn’t just
menomenema anymore. You could talk about football stuff, because Shabba was into Arsenal and everyone is into football as well. But when it all changed to garage, that’s where the Heartless Crew took over. Emma Warren So you were DJing during that period. How did you start DJing? Skepta My dad was a DJ, he played a lot of reggae in his time. So I had loads of equipment, I had a deck that was grey it was so old. And I had a karaoke machine that had pitch on it as well, so I played the tape, played the deck, mixed them together and all my friends would come in and think, “Yeah yeah yeah, this is good, this is good.” Emma Warren Wicked. One deck and a karaoke machine. Skepta It was pants, it was the most rubbish set-up ever. I used to get really into it, then I started buying records, that was a craze. I got myself some decks from Cash Converters and from there I’d go to every record shop I could. I’d listen to the Heartless Crew and, any tune they played, I’d go into the shop
and say, “Have you got that song that goes na-na-na na-na-na?” And they’d say,
“What are you talking about? Don’t you know the name?” “No.” I’d take my tape
in, show it to them and see if they’d got it. But most of them they wouldn’t have it, because Heartless Crew got the stuff first. But just wanting to be like all the other DJs, that was my drive. So I’d keep going, keep going. I loved DJing, just loved it. Emma Warren So what were the records you were really chasing at that point? Skepta There were bait ones, things like “Sweet Like Chocolate” you could get anywhere. Emma Warren Let’s do a little translation moment for the Russians or the Chilean: What
does “bait” mean? Skepta “Bait” means, like, obvious. Everyone knows it. There were a couple of obvious tracks you could just get, but it’s still garage. There were points where it was just getting so grimy, like
“Dilemma,” a track by So Solid. Emma Warren Do you have that with you? Skepta No, that’s a very, very old track, but that was one of the turning points. Emma Warren You mean that point when garage was starting to turn into the things that ended up being grime? Skepta When I used to DJ I remember a point where I used to think something’s happening here, I don’t know what
it is but it reminds me of jungle, but slowed down, a bit more grim-y. Another was “138 Trek,” Zinc’s track, that was a turning point as well. At those stages I thought, “Something’s happening here.” Those are the tunes that I couldn’t get in the record shops – by the time I got there they were gone. Emma Warren So you were a DJ first, and then you started producing? Skepta I used to produce when I was a DJ, but my tracks were pants. It was all low. I used to mix it in bare low, I couldn’t hear it, it was overpowering, it was pants, it was
dead. [laughs] It was dead, the tune had no substance to it whatsoever, but
I used to like it. I liked my tunes. Emma Warren But people who are DJing but not producing yet, they have to go through that phase of making really rubbish tunes. If you want to get good, you have to go through that phase of just trying it. Skepta I used to make [versions of] tunes I liked. If I loved that tune so much, I used to try and see how he made it or what he was thinking of. I used to make loads of tunes that I liked. Emma Warren Can you give us an example? Skepta I made “Dilemma” a lot of times. So much times. I loved the sounds and stuff. Emma Warren Were you also using Playstation Music 2000, was it? Skepta I had Cubase first. Music 2000, the CD came into my house somehow and then I started using it. I made quite a big tune on that, actually. I mostly used Cubase, making songs that I knew or liked. Emma Warren You just said you made quite a big tune on Music 2000. What was that? Skepta It was called “Pulse Eskimo,” it was like a bootleg of the track Wiley had at the time. I made it in my house. Everyone was coming into my house, my mum was going to work at like 9 in the morning, coming back at 6. So we used to have the whole day, music blaring top to bottom, everyone was coming in the house going, “Oh my god, this song is sick.” I cut it on a
dubplate and used to play it on the radio, then somehow my friend, I don’t know how he got it but he gave it to Wiley. He played it at Sidewinder and then suddenly it went... I had my own track but it
was big in my area, in North London, but at the time grime was very East London-based. So when they played it, it went mad from there. Emma Warren So that was the first time you met Wiley? Skepta I think so. That was the first time I became on speaking terms with him. At first there was a disagreement because he took the track and put it out. So then everyone from my area wasn’t speaking to people from his area, “What’s going on? Where’s this boy’s money?” But we worked it out and became friends and afterwards he would check for me, find out what songs I was making. Emma Warren I know with all scenes from hip-hop onwards, there’s always this beef, problems that can happen between people. How serious are the problems that can happen between people from different grime crews or people from different parts of London? Skepta I think it’s all in the artist. If everyone here is my friend and everyone on that side is your friend, if me and you have a disagreement, it’s up to us whether these people fight. Sometimes in the music the artist wants to portray that he’s a gangster or whatever. I’ve had a lot of MC battles in grime, a lot of them, like countless ones, but I don’t ever go thinking that I’m some gangster. If I say to my friends, you know what? It’s just music, there’s nothing more to it, then they don’t have a problem. But some people have got points to prove. They’ve got complexes. Maybe they think everyone thinks
they’re an idiot. Emma Warren Clashing is a really important part of grime culture, isn’t it? Can you explain what happens? How low can you go with your disses to people? Skepta Clashing. That is from dancehall. If you watch the
Stings, people like Ninjaman, Shabba Ranks, one of the best clashes ever. It comes from that kind of vibe. I’m an MC, I’m gonna say I’m better than you, you’re gonna say you’re better than me, then we might diss each other’s trainers, clothes, tracks. Then it goes, goes, goes – normally it stops at
mum. If someone says mum. Your mum looks like Shrek, or someone. Then that’s it, the microphones go down, everything stops and it goes mad. Emma Warren So what else is off-limits? Skepta I think it’s mum, really. Dads can pass, you can phone your dad and tell him someone’s just said something about him on radio. He might come down. Emma Warren Has your dad ever come down? Skepta No, no, no. Emma Warren Has anyone’s dad ever come down? Skepta Some dads have been involved in the beefs before. The mum part is where it gets... Sisters. I’ve
heard sisters before and they’ve slid through, but mums never get slid through, ever ever ever. I don’t know why. But it’s been like that ever since school. Mum’s always been an argument-finisher from years ago. Emma Warren It’s pretty much the standard way to just say, “Let’s just fight.” Talking of
which, your brother’s “Punch In the Face” tune is quite big at the moment. What’s he saying on that record? Skepta Everywhere you go there’s gun violence and knife violence and he’s saying it’s a bit cowardly. Everyone wants to stab or shoot but nobody wants to punch, stand there right and have a fight. That’s something that’s missing now and it’s just going crazy. Nobody should fight, everyone should live in harmony in a perfect world, but everyone argues
and there’s nothing wrong with having a fight. You stop and shake hands when it’s over. If the anger got to you to that extent where you felt you needed to lash out, then have a fight; but it’s gone crazy with the gun and the knife crime. He’s just saying nobody wants to punch someone in the face and
everyone’s a coward – not everyone, but a lot of people. Emma Warren So between you, you’re covering both spectrums because you’ve got tunes like “Nokia Charger Wire” and he’s got tunes like that. Do you ever have those conversations about the sort of things you’re talking about? Can you tell us about “Nokia Charger Wire”? Skepta “Nokia Charger Wire” is... it’s basically, me as a person, I’m a cool guy, down-to-earth. I don’t think I’m big. I’ve got
different types of tunes that will show different sides of me. Sometimes I’m happy,
sometimes I’m in a club, sometimes I’m sad, sometimes I’m angry. “Nokia Charger Wire” was one of my angry tunes, just saying some MCs have taken it too far. It’s gone too far to turn around, that’s what it is about. Emma Warren Do you have that tune with you? Skepta Yeah, it’s on my MySpace actually. This is a little bit of my Michael Jackson singing-style music. (music: Skepta – “Nokia Charger Wire”) Emma Warren I wanted to ask you about lyrics, because there’s a culture of writing lyrics for hundreds of thousands of kids in the UK where they’re writing really fucking clever stuff. Can you tell us how you build your lyrics? Skepta I try to write so everyone can understand me. There are some MCs in the world that can get a pen and a paper and write lyric right now, but I can’t do that. I try to go about my business, you know, and if I notice something or something comes into my mind. It might be something from a long time ago that I just remembered, then I might just write a lyric that everyone can understand me. Emma Warren So where did the idea for the image of the Nokia charger wire come from? Skepta [pause] Alright, let’s not play around. What I’m trying to say is I want a weapon as long as a Nokia charger wire. I don’t think there is one that long. Emma Warren It would be quite hard to conceal. Skepta A Nokia charger wire is probably a bit longer than this table, about as tall as me. So I wanted to make a cartoon for myself, say something that was so surreal so people would find it funny but at the same time take me seriously. Emma Warren There’s a Kode9 tune “Skeng” as well, isn’t there? Which is just repetition of the word “skeng.” [says it in deep Jamaican voice] I really shouldn’t do stuff like that because I sound so terrible. We should do a bit of like a slang translation throughout. Skepta There’s a slang dictionary on the internet. Emma Warren Yeah there are a few different ones. Maybe words that come up regularly in grime tunes, often people haven’t got a clue what they mean. Tell you what, can you tell us what they mean? What is a “waste man”? Skepta A waste man, that’s what it is. A waste man. Emma Warren One more level of explanation. Skepta A waste man is someone who’s just waste. Just an idiot. A waste of space, a waste of breath. They’re just a waste man. D’you know what I mean? Emma Warren I feel sorry for the girls. Because the feminine equivalent of a waste man is? Skepta What, a waste girl? Emma Warren There’s one worse isn’t there? Skepta I don’t know. Emma Warren OK, let’s not go there because there is. What about “floss”? Skepta To floss is to... to stunt. To show off. You can floss jewelery, you can floss clothes, you
can even floss your girl. You can floss something you own, that’s what it
means. Emma Warren So flossing. OK. What about “greazee”? Skepta Greazee means grimy, that’s the best way to explain it. To be greazee is to be like grimy, to be like ghettoish. Emma Warren I suppose hard-bodied would fall into the same area. Skepta [laughs] You’re making me laugh. Yeah, that’s what it means. Emma Warren And what do you find yourself saying a lot? Apart from “a lot,” that’s another
one. Skepta What do I say a lot? There’s a new one going around which is... And what do you find yourself saying a lot? Apart from “a lot,” that’s another “par.” I shouldn’t have said it because a par is anything, it can be anything you want. Sometimes I’m with someone who’s not from my particular area, someone who
doesn’t know, and they’re so lost when we’re talking. A nice girl will be, “Oh my gosh, she’s a par.” Or if I give you the microphone [pulls it away as Emma tries to grab it], that’s a par. Emma Warren I thought that was a par, I didn’t know it could be used other ways. Skepta If I’m walking with my friend, I’m parring with him. It can mean anything, it’s a mad word. I don’t know what happened to it. A nice girl can be a par or an ugly girl can be a par. “Oh my god she’s a par, why you walking with her.” Or, “Oh my god, she’s a par.” That word is sick. Emma Warren So it’s almost like punctuation, like when you put “still” at the end. Skepta I say “still” a lot, but for no reason, like, “I’m hungry still.” Emma Warren But to me the way that MCs use English is really fascinating and I feel like in a way people don’t understand quite how clever it is. Can you give us an example of a lyric that would make you go, “Wow, that’s a par”? Skepta [laughs] Yeah, that’s how I’d say it, that’s what I mean. JME – and I’m not just saying it because
he’s my brother – wrote a lyric that is good. He wrote a lyric that basically could be like a game of pool, like not snooker, but pool, you know. And
it could’ve been drugs as well. So if we imagine crack and a game of pool, he said, “When I started the game, I picked up a queue / Every five minutes I get
two shots / I never get caught with the white in the pocket / I get rid of the 8-ball in a couple of shots / I cut the 8-ball by eye / Because in maths I weren’t a fool / Real guys understand that I shot / But other guys think I’m talking about pool.” When he wrote that,
everyone was going crazy. Everyone, Wiley, was like how did you do that? I know he’s trying to write another one, but I don’t think anyone’s written a better lyric than that in grime. Emma Warren That’s the thing, writing a lyric that the general public think is about pool but putting it in a way that the people you’re talking to know it’s about something else. And there’s a lot of that in grime isn’t there? Skepta People have tried to write others but they’re not as good. When he said, “Never get caught with the white in the pocket,” I just thought, yeah. You don’t just write that. It’s deep thought. It’s only eight bars, but it’s
deep thought. There’s a lot of people that do mad stuff with lyrics. Emma Warren Can you tell us where the term “certain mans” is used? Skepta When you go to write a lyric you have someone in mind, do you know what I mean? It could be Tony Blair, it could be George Bush, or it could be someone from the area who’s getting on your nerves. Who’s annoying you or making you angry. Rather than saying their name, because you don’t always need to show people you’re
interested, you can say “certain man,” or “dem man” or “those guys,” it’s just words MCs put in there without being specific, because it could end in a clash. Not with Tony Blair or George Bush. Emma Warren Who knows, Tony Blair might be calling up his dad, bring him down. Skepta It could end up in a clash, but you might not want to give them the time of day, so you generalize the lyric. Make it general. Emma Warren So you make it general, but what do you put in underneath to personalize it so people know who you’re talking about? How do you do that? Skepta People who are clued-up about it will know. Emma Warren Can you give us an example? Perhaps not, we don’t want to unleash any beef. Skepta Nah, nah, nah. Emma Warren OK, let’s move on. Tell us about the Rinse compilation you did recently. Skepta I used to DJ there, so I used to always ring up Geeneus,
the boss, and ask him if I could DJ. He used to say, “You’re an MC, why do you
want to do everything?” “Let me DJ. I want to DJ.” He said, “No, you can’t
have a show, but you can do a Rinse compilation.”
Skream has done one,
Geeneus has done one, Supa D did a funky house one. They let me do it, man. I was happy to do it as
well. I played tracks that I liked from across the board, funky ones, grime ones, dubstep. Emma Warren I think people who’ve checked the other video archives that are related to your world
will know about Rinse FM and will know how important it’s been to UK garage and dubstep. But from your
point of view, with Rinse as a grime station, how important has Rinse been to grime? Skepta It’s been very important. Nowadays, I don’t think people take radio as seriously as before. A lot of people don’t have as much drive as before. Back in the day, people didn’t have £2,000 or £3,000, so to go on the radio and promote your song was a big thing, but people are getting paid now so they’re dropping back a bit. There’s not as much pirate radio as before but for grime, pirate radio in general is very important. That’s something that’s been lost somehow. Like I said, obviously the drives have gone. But there are some weeks when I really want to go on the radio and Rinse has helped every genre of music. Emma Warren One thing I did want to ask you about was freestyling, because there’s a big thing about freestyling in grime and Jamie Woon was telling me earlier about things he’d seen on YouTube of people trying to freestyle while doing different things, like Tinchy Stryder freestyling while he’s driving his car round, and JME while he’s playing his X-Box, Gears of War. Is this something you might do? Skepta First things first. A freestyle, as people understand it, is where if you told
me to MC about this [puts hands on turntable], then I’d freestyle about it.
That’s from the American rap side. Freestyling in grime is saying a lyric you’ve already written, but with no intention of it being on a record. You’re saying it on a beat, you’re saying the lyric on a beat. So I found myself freestyling in loads of places.
Yesterday when I was in the club playing house I was freestyling, just doing my thing in the corner, getting drunk. It’s like personal practice, something you do in your spare time. Emma Warren So where else might you see people doing it, other than playing computer games
or driving around? Skepta Freestyling anywhere; that’s probably what it means – free styles, do it anywhere. At the bus stop, kids on their phones MCing to each other. If we go to a club, we might be doing it in a circle, six of us, over a house track. It’s just practice. Emma Warren What direction are you moving in musically? What’s coming up for you? Skepta In America they’ve got hip-hop. They’ve got so many states. They make music there, everyone knows it, they sell out, everyone knows their track. I think it’s gonna be a long time until grime really, really kicks off over there, so with me traveling around – I mean, I’ve been to Russia, I’ve been to Israel, I’ve been most countries in Europe. I feel more
at home when I’m in Europe. I feel like they get what I’m doing. The house style, the
4/4 style, the grimy style, they already have it without me coming over to give it to them. It’s in their culture to rave to house. It’s like putting 50 Cent on a house beat, that’s what I see myself as, so I want to try and expand that. When I went to France, their MCs are heavy as well, they’re sick. I want it to grow, I want Europe, I think we can have our own thing. There are more states than there are in America. When I go abroad I try to get peoples’ CDs, even if I just do a freestyle on it, like, “This is Johann, Johann Productions,” I MC on Johann’s production, I send it back to his MySpace, people hear about it. If everyone in Europe networks like that – it might not even be in my day, maybe for the youth, maybe it’s grime or whatever you want to call it – they can be an MC. Obviously, I want to do albums, I want Boy Better Know to
be the biggest thing in the world, but really, really, really, I want there to be a massive scene all over Europe. So when I release something, everyone in Europe buys it. As well as everyone in HMV. Because at the moment, all I ever see is an American artist going, “Hey! Ho!” It’s getting old now. Not that I don’t like it, 50 Cent, Biggie Smalls will always be great MCs, but there’s not enough recognition for people like us who put deep emotion into production. So I just want to travel the world and spread. Emma Warren It’s interesting that for a sound that was so local and regional, you want it to be massively European and international. Skepta I MC over all types of music. I’ll make sure when I leave here I’ll take some beats. If I can MC on it, I’ll MC on it. I hope that in 20 to 30 years’ time, all the good people in France know all the good people in Sweden and so forth and so on. Emma Warren So take note, world. Can you play us something that sums up where you’re going musically? And while you’re looking, can you tell us a bit about the Boy Better Know T-shirts, because they’ve ended up being a phenomenon, haven’t they? Skepta JME made them just to wear on stage, made one for me, made one for someone else. Then when we used to go places, everyone would ask us if they could have one, and from there it got a bit crazy. Every show I go to there are people with Boy Better Know T-shirts there. Every single show. Emma Warren So what are you up to now? Last I heard it was 30 thousand? Skepta I don’t know, there are bootlegs. You can go to the market and buy fake ones. Emma Warren You’ve got some new T-shirts coming out, haven’t you? Skepta Yeah, there are new ones. I want to turn it into a designer, but JME wants to keep it a bit sporty at the moment. Hold on, I want to find something. I made this when I was in Turkey the other day, in my hotel room. [music: Skepta – unknown] When I listen to that tune, that makes me want to MC. That’s was what was happening to me when I was DJing. I’d be looking at people MCing and thinking I need to get on the microphone, but I never had a lyric. Emma Warren So what will come out lyrically when you do a vocal over it? Skepta This track is going to be something crazy. I’m going to think of what I can say to make everybody... I think that’s a good way to approach songs, you know. I’m gonna say what that song is telling me to say. So sometimes, if you write a lyric, with nothing, it’s pointless, because you aren’t feeding off nothing, you know what I mean? But when I listen to that tune, I don’t know what I’m going to say, but I know that it's gonna something crazy because... (music: Skepta – unknown) I don’t know, I don’t know. Yeah. Just trying to incorporate the whole strings
effect and stuff. Maybe someone who’s into playing might appreciate my chords and stuff. Emma Warren I’ve got a couple more questions I want to ask you, but you [speaking to the audience] should start thinking about questions, too, because we’re going to be putting it out. Skepta I feel like I’m on Jerry Springer. [laughs] Emma Warren No one’s going to come and attack you, there’ll be none of that going on. You know, they’ve got things they wanna ask you. Skepta [to participant] Were you the DJ yesterday? Good set. Emma Warren Props are due. Anything else we should know about, any other hook-ups you’ve
got going on? Skepta Let me check MySpace a moment. Emma Warren Who needs a diary when you’ve got a tour list on your MySpace? Skepta Greatest Hits was out last year this time in England, September 17th. The
“Rolex” track has just come out and then fingers crossed my album will be out
December first. That’s my objective at the moment, get that out, Microphone Champion. I want to try and do a big tour for grime over the next year somehow. Take some time out from shows over the New Year. So when I come back it has more of an impact. So “Rolex Sweep,” then the next single – which has been vocalled already, I’m
just trying to think of a name for it – and then my album Microphone Champion on December the first for me, immediately. Emma Warren Any wish list stuff? Say in a couple of years time, where would you like to be and who would you like to be working with? Skepta In three years time, I just want to be, just like, juggernaut, colossal, massive, d’you know what I mean? Working with all different types of people. You can only cook a meal the same way so many times. I want to try and branch out and make connections. When Arctic Monkeys came out – which is a big rock band in the UK – a grime person
wants to connect with them. Say, you want to work with Arctic Monkeys, yeah, you can try it but it’s not really going to work. It’s good to try and find something else that no one else would really have thought about, then you can make it happen and make it big. Then people will think, “I want to work with them.” I just want to be networking with so many different people. Because I produced that myself,
but not every track I produce I want to MC on, because it’s a bit too me, me, me, me. I want to give that track to someone else and see what they’re thinking, like I do what that track makes me think. It’s a bit more wider. In three years time, I want to be free, be on my fifth album, working with crazy other people who no
one will ever expect me to. I don’t think it’s all about the UK at all. Because a few years ago everyone said it was all about America. There wasn’t nothing else to listen to. When Tupac and Biggie Smalls were MCing, there was no one in the UK doing
anything. No one would’ve said there would be a Skepta or a Dizzee Rascal or a JME. In three or four years time I want it to keep growing. Because it’s in Europe it will never die, because it’s in the culture. All it takes is for people to work together. In England there are a lot of egos, people thinking that they’re better than a person. It’s weird, you approach someone to do a track together and his manager says, “That’s not going to benefit you. Don’t do it.” I don’t care about egos, I only live once, I love music and I want to work with everyone. If I hadn’t done that track with Bless Beats I wouldn’t
have “Rolex Sweep.” If I hadn’t said, “I’m going to vocal that electro track,”
I wouldn’t have it. And that’s my biggest song right now. So we’ve got to link up. MySpace is a good thing. I get alot of messages. Someone says, “Can you come on MySpace and listen to my track?” Sometimes I won’t go on there. Maybe it’s the way they say it. If someone says, “Listen to my track now! It’s the best!” – then I won’t go on
that one, I don’t care about that. If you approach me, I’m just human being innit? MySpace back, email. Internet’s a good thing. We’ve got so much things we didn’t use back in the day. You can MP3 me a track in five minutes. Networking is the key word. Emma Warren Definitely, this is the right place to be celebrating that sort of thing. Has anyone got anything they want to ask? Audience Member I just want to ask you to play that “Intensive Snare” track because that was
really interesting. Skepta That can be done. DJ Emma? (music: Plastician feat. Skepta – “Intensive Snare”) Skepta That’s another collaboration that I didn’t know that I was going to do. And a lot of people love that track. They love it. It’s all about sometimes thinking outside the box and doing stuff that you don’t normally do, really. Audience Member I heard in this “Intensive Snare” track, the whole beat and the arrangement of the song is quite actually minimalistic – there’s the kick and the snare and you were like the whole rhythmic structure. Your MCing was totally filling up the whole track. Normally in dubstep or something you have lots of percussive elements and hi-hats on it. Is that annoying for an MC? If I’m supposed to produce a track with an MC, what should I take care of? If it’s too rhythmically full, is that a turn-off for you? Skepta Not really. I can try and work my way around anything a producer does. I think the production should be free. When you’re a producer don’t worry about what the singer is gonna do. What’s your name? Audience Member Hussein. Skepta I’ll say, “Hussein, I like this part here, maybe sing a bit on there, then I want you to take out something.” It’s better that you make the track as big, loud, as much
percussion, strings, LFOs, as much as you want, then when I hear it I’ll say, “I like that,” or, “I’d like to MC on that bit without the synths in it.” There ain’t really nothing an MC can’t MC on. Emma Warren Interesting point though about how the voice provides part of the structure. Skepta I always say the best MC is the MC who can make themselves another instrument
on the track. Just the tone of how you say something can make or break the
tune, which is the key. Come back to again, always try to do what the track tells you to do. Emma Warren So it’s all about absorbing the feeling and expressing it in your voice. Who
else? Audience Member Was there ever a time when a producer who you didn’t already know fascinated you, and you wanted to cooperate with him and put some vocals on his track? Do you even have time to listen, because as you said there are many people annoying you? But if someone would be nice and give you the track, woulc you have even the time? So the question is about cooperation with new producers. Skepta I just love music, any kind of music. If it’s got that, I call it the crying element, it’s to make me cry. Sometimes
I’ll just hear a tune and [imitates being lost for words]. Audience Member Has it ever happened with a new producer that you were fascinated with the track? Skepta Lemme think. When was the last time that happened to me? [pause] You know what? Hold on one second. What we do is sometimes I’ll be out somewhere and someone will give me a CD and I can’t listen to it right there, but what we do is, when we drive to a show, we’ll have five CDs that people have given us already and we’ll listen to them on the way. And we’ve got something we call “out the window.” [laughter] Emma Warren Guess what that is. Skepta Basically it means, if it’s not good, it goes out the window. But if it’s good, we can do whatever we want on it. I can’t find the track now, I don’t know why it’s not on my computer. Emma Warren So if you’re ever driving down the motorway in the UK and you see round silver things flying out of the window, you know who you’re following. Skepta I can’t explain what I mean by a crying part of a track, but it could be just one chord that makes me feel emotion. That’s what I love about music, that emotional part, and if anyone gives me a beat that’s got that in it, I will vocal it without fail. I will definitely write to it. This was a track that was given to me by a producer from East London. Listen to this, this tune is deep. (music: unknown) That is an emotional tune. Emma Warren I think this is probably the point at which we say thank you very much to Skepta and make sure you hit him up with your music. Skepta Thanks.

Skream
In 2006, at the height of dubstep’s creativity, one-man production powerhouse Skream visited Melbourne to kick back on the Red Bull Music Academy couch. While there, he revealed the roots of his skanking riddims, and how this fascinating, raw and visceral sound came from one close-knit family of DJs and producers in South London, then took over the world.
Hosted by EMMA WARREN Here we have on the couch, Skream [applause]. I thought it would be pretty good if we start from the beginning. What was the music that got you into it? SKREAM Underground garage, really. The sort of darker, two-step sort of stuff. El-B, Artwork. If anyone listens to garage, they’ll know who I’m talking about. If you don’t, I’ll play you something in a minute. I started DJing at 11, and wanted to take it to the next level. There wasn’t enough stuff that I wanted, and it wasn’t as dark as I wanted it to be, so I thought I’ll just start making some stuff that’s pretty dark. EMMA WARREN You said you started DJing when you were 11. Where do you DJ when you’re 11? SKREAM In my bedroom. I used to lurk around record shops quite a bit. My brother used to work in Big Apple, which was like the main, sort of underground headquarters in Croydon. Just hanging about the record shops, really. EMMA WARREN You grew up in Croydon. For anyone that doesn’t know, it’s a particularly concrete jungly part of South London. Your brother was into music and was working at this big record shop. You’re 11, and you’re DJing in your bedroom. What happens next? SKREAM Nothing. You just wait until you get bored of that and move on to the next thing, which was obviously production. I didn’t really know much about it when I started, as no one does, but I got introduced to making music on PlayStation, which got boring pretty quick. I moved on to FruityLoops and stuff, which I still use now. EMMA WARREN I want to stick a bit longer on this early point, when you’re 11, 12, 13. You talked a bit about dark garage, but I don’t know if everyone’s going to know where that is in context. What sort of music is this? This is the music that came after jungle and after two-step? SKREAM It was always there. It was just the more instrumental stuff. You always had it on the B-side, obviously. The instrumentals… there was always more to them than the vocal tracks, which were normally really cheesy and sort of girl tunes, do you know what I mean? EMMA WARREN You said before that your brother was working in a record shop. He’s a DJ as well? SKREAM Yeah, he used to be in Inta Natty with Grooverider, Fabio, Bailey. EMMA WARREN What sort of stuff was he playing? SKREAM Dark, dark, dark jungle, like the Moving Shadow sort of stuff. Good Looking, No U-Turn. Really dark jungle, really. EMMA WARREN How did that influence you? Is that the sort of stuff… would you be listening to him playing in his bedroom? SKREAM I used to think it was a racket. I listen back to it now and get more influence. Dubstep is really a lot like the old jungle; it’s just purely stripped-down, minimal beats and bass, which I think most music should have stayed at. Just kept it raw. EMMA WARREN What about, you mentioned El-B as someone who really influenced you and turned you on to the kind of things you wanted to do. Could you play us something to illustrate this early period of pre-dubstep… So what is it that we’re going to hear? SKREAM It’s a track called “Buck & Bury.” It’s the first track that I really freaked over. EMMA WARREN We’re breaking the speakers already. So where did you first hear that? SKREAM FWD>>. El-B actually played it. He actually played it down at FWD>>. I used to go there when I was 14, 15. EMMA WARREN For the uninitiated, what’s Forward? SKREAM It’s a club in London which basically focused on underground music as a whole. The people who run it is the people who run Tempa, which is a main dubstep label, which I’m signed to. It was just a place you went to hear, it was the people who wanted to hear underground stuff. You could go to the big clubs and just hear waste music all night, cheesy vocals and two-step. That was the place to go for underground. EMMA WARREN You were like, 13 or 14 or 15? SKREAM I’d say 15. EMMA WARREN You were 15. What was it like then? SKREAM It was still coming from the garage thing, still a sort of champagne… sort of shirts, jeans. Then, the trainspotters started getting in, the journalists and it all started then. Garage started dying and FWD>> was a place for… it was mainly men. Man music. EMMA WARREN Connecting with masculine side. SKREAM Yeah. For ages, it was never big crowds for a few years. It was just the heads that wanted to hear it. EMMA WARREN It’s funny you should say that. I remember someone saying there was a theory about clubs. Clubs are either about the music, they’re about pulling, they’re about drugs, and it sounds like the whole thing is very much essentially about the music and hearing it in the best way possible. If you’re 15, you’re going to these clubs. What does this mean? You go to school the next day and you’re falling asleep during maths? SKREAM Yeah. Pretty much. I wasn’t really a great school-lover. Music was the only route I possibly could have taken. EMMA WARREN How did you start moving into that, because by the time you were going to FWD>> your tunes were already being played, weren’t they? SKREAM Not the first FWD>>s, it was a little while, I had to try and get to a bar. Hatcha worked in Big Apple. Anyone knows about dubstep, Hatcha was the pioneer, the only person playing it. The first DJ playing dubs in garage. EMMA WARREN Let’s fill in the gaps here. You started DJing in your room, got quite good at that. Started making music on the PlayStation and then …? SKREAM It wasn’t PlayStation for too long, I got really bored. EMMA WARREN Then you got Fruity Loops and started mucking about with that and making stuff. How long did it take you to get a to a point where you made something where you felt it was good enough to show someone? SKREAM After about a year. Eleven months to a year. It weren’t the greatest production, but it was different. It was what Hatcha wanted, really. EMMA WARREN You say you spent a year getting into it. How much time would you be spending making music? SKREAM A lot of time. Homework time [laughs]. Just sitting on the computer. Basically, I was trying to copy what El-B and Zed Bias were doing. Obviously, they had like 10-grand studios and I had free, cracked software, so through trying to copy them, I got my own sound and worked from there. EMMA WARREN What do you think you were doing differently? Was it just the fact that you were using the most basic… SKREAM It was a lot more stripped-down than everything else, was just beats and bass. Maybe an odd atmosphere or sample rolling through the background. EMMA WARREN The beats and the bass – that’s the core of the whole sound, isn’t it? SKREAM Yeah, yeah. Predominantly; it’s definitely bass-led. EMMA WARREN What was the first thing that got played out that Hatcha sort of took on? SKREAM It was useless, I haven’t bought it. It was just like a 4/4 thing with his name. I’d try to copy a Jaimeson track because Jaimeson was a 4/4 producer. That got played, and then I started listening to some of the El-B production stuff a bit more. It was just trying to copy them and get my own sound in the process. EMMA WARREN There’s another guy that you’ve always worked with as well, and you two were doing stuff for Hatcha? SKREAM Benga. We actually met playing each other tunes down the phone. We hadn’t actually seen each other face-to-face. I met his brother and his brother said he wanted to be a producer. We started playing each other tracks then become pretty good friends. Had our first release together. EMMA WARREN There’s something quite interesting about this because at this point you two are making records basically for Hatcha, aren’t you? So he can have an exclusive. SKREAM No one else had them, yeah. EMMA WARREN It’s a really Jamaican way of doing things, isn’t it? Were you aware of that or that’s just how it works? SKREAM That’s just how it was. He was stubborn really, didn’t want us to give it to anyone else. EMMA WARREN How would that work? Would he be just like, saying to you, “If you give me a tune I’ll play it for you but you can’t give it to anyone else”? SKREAM We was writing a ridiculous amount of tunes, we was doing like 30, 40 tracks a week, and we’d take them down to him, and whatever he’d play would get heard. EMMA WARREN You’re writing 30 to 40 a week for the last five years? SKREAM No, it’s toned down a bit. It’s toned down. It toned down when I got into mixing down. I wasn’t really bothered, I didn’t really know nothing about engineering or nothing. When I started I wasn’t even aware of EQs or nothing. The whole time it was just changing the bass sounds and twisting the bass and changing drums sort of thing. EMMA WARREN There’s a load of stuff that’s really parallel to the way things have worked in Jamaica before all that – exclusivity, dubs, sound systems, the bass? SKREAM I’ve only just started realizing that sort of stuff over the past year. EMMA WARREN Why do you think that is? SKREAM Digital Mystikz has a lot to do with it. They sort of come with this earthy, raw, heavily reggae-influenced sound. I think the whole sound system thing in dubstep is, it was always at Plastic People. Plastic People in London is quite a respected club. It’s got a good sound system, so you’re just used to hearing it on a good sound system, so we can’t really hear it nowhere else. EMMA WARREN We were chatting about this before, but one of the things I think is really interesting about the whole sound is that if you hear it on the radio or just at home, it can sort of fall flat. You don’t get the full punch of the whole thing, but as soon as you’ve heard it live and you’ve heard it coming through big speakers in a dirty, dark sweaty club, then there’s an instant moment of connection with it as it being something really amazing. SKREAM We’ve all been brought up… all the producers have been brought up on a good system. So I think that’s got a lot to do with it, really. EMMA WARREN Which places in London, if anyone’s going to be there, should they be checking out? SKREAM Plastic People. Plastic People or Brixton Mass every other month when Digital Mystikz hold the night DMZ. If you’re ever in London, you’ve got to make it down there because if you haven’t really experienced dubstep, that’s the place to experience it. Either Plastic People or Mass. EMMA WARREN For the people who were at you gig on Friday, if you’ve got a scale of one to ten and that was like whatever, where’s… SKREAM The crowd was a ten. The crowd was amazing. It felt like being in London. People was freaking, and it’s good when you come this far away from home and people know what you’re playing. It’s weird almost because they’re asking… I got asked to play tracks that I only cut last week. It’s like, how’d you know about it? Obviously the internet, but it’s just pretty freaky. EMMA WARREN This is the Barefiles massive, maybe? SKREAM Yeah, [inaudible], yeah. EMMA WARREN On Friday you got handed a pair of boxing gloves, I know. What is that all about? SKREAM Random. Completely random. Freaked me out a bit, as it goes. I thought it was something like an Australian thing. EMMA WARREN Maybe it was something really special and important he had and he was trying show you a lot of love by giving you [them]. That’s a mystery that’s never going to be solved. SKREAM Whatever floats your boat, I guess [laughs]. EMMA WARREN The clubs we’re talking about in London, FWD>>, DMZ. Are they kind of like the Croft Institute for the people who haven’t been there, or maybe aren’t going to be there… SKREAM Dark. Similar, like dark, not really much light, not really no visuals, because it’s just there to concentrate on the music. You don’t need visuals… that’s just sort of something to hide a bad sound system or something to cover something else up. EMMA WARREN Basically, it’s there in the music, and it’s there in the clubs and it’s there in the presentation. It’s all about the basics, isn’t it? The whole sound, it’s about stripping out everything you don’t need, so the clubs are dark, sweaty, smoke holes with one light, but massive speakers, and the music similarly. Everything that doesn’t need to be in there is taken out. SKREAM It’s the way it should be. EMMA WARREN It doesn’t need to be in there it’s taken out. It’s the way it should be. Overcrowded music is not always nice to the ears, is it? EMMA WARREN Let’s hear a couple of things that you’ve done, or the two tracks you were talking about earlier that have both got a big, heavy dub influence, if we’re talking about sound systems. SKREAM This one’s a track called “Irie.” It was when I first started sort of listening to a lot more dub sort of stuff. EMMA WARREN No breaking the speakers. (music: Skream – “Irie” / applause) Emma Warren A bit of speaker wreckage going on here. I guess the guys that are running the sound system at the clubs have got to really know what they’re doing. SKREAM You’ve got to know what you’re doing whenever you’re dealing with sound, I guess. EMMA WARREN That sounded raw. What I’m saying is that there’s a whole massive culture around speakers and sound systems and making sure that everything is properly on point. Let’s just talk a minute about that record. When did you do it? How did it come about? SKREAM I think I done it January, February. I just started hearing Coki and Mala out of Digital Mystikz and it's sort of really heavily musical dub-sounding stuff. It was just really cool because I haven’t really heard nothing like it out. Basically, I started wanting to tap into that side of things because it just adds another whole contrast to your set, playing out, and just to you as a producer really because you just start branching out… just trying different things, just listening to a lot of the old dub records and seeing the methods they used. EMMA WARREN If you’re listening to old stuff as well, is there anything specific that you’re taking from that? Are you listening to the way that they’re kind of... SKREAM Just all the stuff like structure, effects and the way it’s been built. EMMA WARREN You were saying as well, there was another dub-influenced record that you could play next to that to show a different sound. Was it that bass and beats thing you said? SKREAM Yeah. Just the whole way bass runs the track. It runs dubstep really. It’s just a track called “Blipsteam.” Basically, I just spent all the time on the bass. It’s pretty stripped down and pretty crackly as well. (music: Skream – “Blipstream” / applause) Just see the way it’s basically just the bass driving you throughout. It’s just a little sort of hook around it just to keep your mind down, I guess. EMMA WARREN When did that come out? SKREAM It came out in March, April. EMMA WARREN There’s something about the sound that’s really… when you’re hearing it out loud, it’s very heavy. SKREAM The bass actually grabs you and sort of takes you. EMMA WARREN It’s heavy in a very physical way because I think… especially talking to people who were there on Friday who hadn’t really heard it before were quite shocked by the impact. It’s not often you go out and you’re physically pulled somewhere by a sound. Is that something that brought you into it or is that just the way you feel when you’re out and you’re hearing it? SKREAM It’s just that feeling, the feeling of the bass rattling in your chest and in your throat. It’s just like yeah… EMMA WARREN Up here in your nose, yeah. SKREAM It’s just like ... yeah. It just feels cool. EMMA WARREN There’s a funny comment off just some forum somewhere where someone was saying, “I’ve never heard a music which rattles your ribcage and makes you feel over the moon at the same time,” which I thought was quite a funny way of looking at it. So we talked about bass, we talked a bit about how you started DJing and how you started making music. Where does pirate radio come into the story? SKREAM Pirate radio is big for any underground music really. It’s where you hear the new music. It’s just like all kids at school, if you want to be the cool sort of music people, you listen to pirate radio because it’s [got that] sort of freshness. EMMA WARREN Not all countries have that culture but in Britain… SKREAM It’s always been a big thing in London. EMMA WARREN In Britain, in London in particular, there’s pirate radio everywhere. They spring up and they’re unstoppable. The authorities try and push them down, then a new one will pop up somewhere else. I suppose there’s always so much music and so many people inventing their own scenes. That’s always expressed through pirate radio. What was the first pirate station you played on? SKREAM Flight FM, which is in the back of some scrap yard, really. You just had to climb through about three metal fences to get to it. It’s pretty pointless, really. I ended up on Rinse, which really shouldn’t be pirate, it should be legal because it’s been going strong for like ten years and it’s always been playing the cream of what people want to hear. Which, I think a lot of radio stations don’t do that. You might have liked a station that plays one hour at two till three in the morning of music that people actually want to hear. EMMA WARREN How did you get your first pirate gig, how did that happen? SKREAM Just for production really. Just getting Hatcha stuff and then people wanted to start hearing more from the producer rather than from the DJ. EMMA WARREN So, people came to you rather than you going to them? SKREAM Not actually. They went to Big Apple, the record shop to find me. EMMA WARREN What about Rinse? Playing on pirate stations is not like playing on a legal station, is it? It’s not like you go to the studio and then some guy on security checking who you are and inviting up and seeing if you want a cup of tea. What’s it like to play on a pirate radio station in London? SKREAM Well, the first few times always I was nervous. It’s nerve-wracking because you think DTI are going to burst in and take your records off you. EMMA WARREN This is the Department of Trade and Industry. SKREAM Basically, you’ve always got that thought. They’ll come and take your records off you and everything’s that in the building. That’s a pretty frightening feeling because your records are your life, I think. It’s how you express yourself. The radio station was pretty mad. I remember once on Rinse, you used to go to the top of these dirty tower block flats and the actual studio was in a box on the wall. You walked into the wall and got into the wall. It was sort of like six foot high. You used to have to crouch down, and you’d have about four or five people just sweating it out all just to play some tunes on the radio. It was pretty dedicated, really. You come out stinking. EMMA WARREN At this point, you had to find some room in the tower block and there’s just a hole in the wall? SKREAM No, that was a one-off. Normally, it’d be someone’s kitchen or some crack flat somewhere. EMMA WARREN So you got kitchens, crack flats, holes in the wall. SKREAM It’s not really inviting. It wasn’t really nice going places when you’re like 15. It’s just sort of places you didn’t want to be but you had to be to get your stuff heard. EMMA WARREN What’s the vibe like when you’re in there and you’re on air? SKREAM The first few months is just pure nervousness, because then you get there it's like, “Oh, this is nothing. This is like being in your bedroom.” Then you realize how many people are listening and it’s like right, “I got to talk now. I’ve never talked on radio.” You just keep thinking how you sound, how you’re mixing. If you do a dodgy mix, you’re like, “Aw!” then you’re not really in it no more. It was just pretty nerve-wracking first of all, but now it just comes naturally, really. EMMA WARREN Tell us about Rinse Now. SKREAM Rinse now is good. Basically, it’s trying to go legal, so it stopped the FM. It’s just on the internet, which is pretty cool because now you can get all the emails and SMS, which is cool. Because now people, you can hear me out here which is a big step. I’ll get texts from Ukraine and texts from Portugal and all over the place, which is really good. It’s an amazing sort of feeling, because you can’t do that with a legal station in England because it only reaches England. EMMA WARREN In a way, them coming off air essentially has been a good thing because it means that your dubstep nation is expanding outside of London? SKREAM There’s actually no reason for it to go legal because what’s the point? If it was going legal, it’s stopping itself from spreading. EMMA WARREN That’s like one of those weird internet swerve balls, isn’t it, that you weren’t expecting? Can you imagine the impact of that is quite massive because now you’ve got making dubstep? You were just saying on the way up here that there’s people making tunes in America and everywhere. SKREAM There’s a big scene for it in America now. Loads of good producers as well. You’ve got a guy called Lexus, and Drop the Lime, I think he was in Brisbane Saturday. Played in Brisbane Saturday, which was pretty weird. It’s cool. It’s pretty mad how the sound has spread. Not that it’s happened quickly because it’s been in London for like five or six years but the impact since January when we done the Radio 1 show. Since then, it’s crazy. I was in New York in June, and it’s like Hank Shocklee from Public Enemy was there. He’s a legend. He’s sort of standing in the booth with me as I’m playing. It’s like, right, this doesn’t add up… you sort of go places and they’re freaking out to tunes that you’ve made. Not made to play in London, but you initially just thought you’d be playing in London and now I’m sitting here. It’s pretty trippy. EMMA WARREN Pretty trippy, indeed. You’ve just mentioned Radio 1. For people that don’t know, what happened in January? SKREAM There was the Dubstep Warz. Basically, Mary Anne Hobbs [runs] a sort of new music show. She decided to have two hours just dedicated to dubstep which no one ever… EMMA WARREN This is on Radio 1, which is the national pop music station, isn’t it? SKREAM Radio One. BBC. Yeah. It was just crazy. The vibe in the studio, everyone was just smiling. Everyone was on such a good one. Everyone was drinking. Everyone was doing whatever. It was surreal. We were running about the Radio 1 studio like ... Zane Lowe, who’s a pretty big DJ, was just walking past us and it’s like, it still seems surreal now. I’ll listen back to the whole show, and I still get the tingles up my spine. It’s mad because since then it’s just gone up. EMMA WARREN … Who was there? What was happening? SKREAM It was me, Digital Mystikz, Vex’d, Distance, Hatcha, Kode9 and Spaceape, and Loefah. EMMA WARREN The all-stars basically. SKREAM Yeah, the Magnificent Seven as I call it. It was mad. It was really, really surreal. I don’t think I’ll ever feel the feeling that everyone felt that night ever again because it was sort of… the emails and stuff that were coming in was like, “We’ve done it!” It was like we finally got the point across that you can make what you want to make and get away with it. You haven’t got to be forced into making commercial house or commercial… that you can take something from the underground up, I guess. EMMA WARREN The other really interesting thing about the whole scene is how, if you were to look at the spectrum of different people that are in the scene ... SKREAM Yeah, it’s not just one ... EMMA WARREN You and Burial, for example are unbelievably different. SKREAM It contrasts. I think that’s what people like, because it’s not ... it’s all dubstep, but there's so much variety. You got Vex’d and Distance who make more drum & bass-influenced [stuff]. You got Burial. I’m not sure he's inspired by, but he’s heavy… it’s pretty mad production. You’ve got Kode9, who’s really sort of laid-back, chilled-out production. You’ve got Digital Mystikz ... well, between the three of them, they’ve got sort of got it all covered. You’ve got Loefah, who’s more beats and bass, and you’ve got Mala who’s pure spiritual, and you’ve got Coki who’s just ill. EMMA WARREN Coki who’s just ill. SKREAM Yeah, Coki who just ill. If you listen to by Coki, the bass just takes you away. EMMA WARREN There was something that Burial said. There is a quote from him which says… someone asked him about what the sound of the scene was and he said, “There are no highway lights to attract rubbish producers. Everyone is just off wandering.” Which I thought was quite a good expression in its way. SKREAM He’s pretty deep. EMMA WARREN In a way, that sums up for me one of the things so appealing about it because somehow, there’s something that connects it. Maybe it’s the bass. Maybe it’s the stripped downness. Maybe it’s kind of the renegade thing. SKREAM Everyone who’s there wasn't so into popular music. I think everyone just thought, "Let's unite," and said, “Let’s do it.” EMMA WARREN Is there a strong sense of family within the scene? SKREAM Yeah, definitely. There is no competition as of yet. There obviously will be because it always happens. We’re all really close friends. Everyone will see one of the other producers once a week. I see Mala every day. I see Loefah every other week. Everyone is really tight, and it’s like, when you are out, you sort of sense it because everyone is drinking together. It’s not like if you go to a house club and another house producer who won’t talk to another house producer. It isn’t like, “Get off my decks. My turn.” Everyone will book everyone for each other’s nights. It’s a family thing. EMMA WARREN What is that doing to the music? SKREAM No one has anything to worry about, no one thinks that, “I better not let him come into my studio cause he'll see what I’m using,” or, “I better not let him in know my technique, because if I do he'll start robbing it.” Everyone is helping each other. Everyone is playing each other’s tracks. We are just pushing each other at the moment. Hopefully, it stays like that forever. I think that, if it does, it should be around for a little while. EMMA WARREN For a little while? SKREAM Yeah. You know what I mean. EMMA WARREN Have you got something else you could play us? SKREAM Yeah. This one’s a remix I’ve done of a techno track by a guy from Leeds in England called [Marc Ashken]. I was listening to quite a bit more minimal techno, and that is where the idea for the remix come from. (music: Marc Ashken – “Roots Dyed Dark (Skream Remix)” / applause) They normally don’t sound like that… that sort of rumbling. EMMA WARREN Tell us something about that. SKREAM I just got approached by a minimal techno label. I’m not too sure what it’s called, but it was through a sort of friend of a friend, and they was really up for me doing a remix. They really liked [“Midnight Request Line”]. They said it reminded them of some techno track. I got to see what I could do with the parts. I did that in an hour, and I had the parts for about four months. I just could never really be bothered to do it, and then they rang me up and said, “We need to master it in the morning,” and I was like, “Alright.” I just did that one in about an hour. The tracks that I normally spend more time on are the tracks I don’t end up liking. It’s the tracks that I do, in say not in an hour, but say an hour-and-a-half to two, three hours, whatever. They’re normally much stronger tracks, I feel like when I try to spend too much time on anything I feel I am trying to go too deep into how people want me to go into building a track. EMMA WARREN What about the ten-inch thing? SKREAM It’s just cheaper than 12s [laughs]. It was just from Hatcha, really. Hatcha always cut tens, and it was just a thing of cutting tens. But 12-inch dubs actually do sound better. Don’t ever get confused that ten-inches do sound better because they don’t. They’re just cheaper as well. Sounds really good, don’t it? Cheapskate! EMMA WARREN What about other remixes that you have done? SKREAM I’ve done some stuff just within the scene, really. Just some remixes for some new producers I was really feeling. Not that if I do a remix that it is going to really help them, but it was just to show people that even though they’re new producers that no one has really heard their stuff, I am still going to do stuff for them. Back to that family thing, if they are safe and cool, why not do a remix for them? It’s not going to hurt you, your reputation. EMMA WARREN After all these years… obviously, you're essentially a veteran, like we were saying earlier. Are you seeing kids now coming through who are the same age you were when you first started? SKREAM Sort of. It’s more people around my age now. You get the more younger sort of kids now, they want to make grime because it’s… with the grime thing, if you can get played with the right MC then it’s a big tune. All you need is an MC to do a phrase over it and that is it. It’s a big tune. EMMA WARREN You’re unusual in the scene, in that grime people kind of like your stuff, don’t they? SKREAM Yeah, I think that is more to do with “Midnight Request Line,” really, because [that] was sort of ... big in grime. It ended up getting bigger in grime than it did in dubstep. Yeah. I am not too sure. EMMA WARREN Maybe this is a good moment to play “Midnight Request Line”? SKREAM I think they want to change the cartridge. I don’t have it on CD. EMMA WARREN Let’s maybe talk about, you’ve got an album coming out ... SKREAM It’s out today. EMMA WARREN It’s out today. SKREAM I just found out. I got a phone call saying they bought it today. EMMA WARREN Yay! [Applause] SKREAM I’ve really got no copies on me. I think there is some coming over, but don’t quote me. EMMA WARREN I’ve got it upstairs. SKREAM Have you? EMMA WARREN Yeah, I do. Maybe towards the end, because it be good to play it. SKREAM I think we can play “Request Line” now. EMMA WARREN No, I suppose have you got the “Tapper” track? SKREAM “Tapped.” EMMA WARREN “Tapped” track. SKREAM Yeah, the one with the MC or without? There’s like three mixes of it. EMMA WARREN Maybe you should decide then. SKREAM [Pulls out a record] This is one with… basically, I’d done the instrumental, and I wanted to get it vocalled, and I chose JME who’s a pretty good grime MC. I chose him because he’s not one of the ones who talks just purely on beef. He talks… I wanted to come with a paranoid flow. I’ve got this thing that Big Brother is watching over all of us and everything is being listened to. I don’t know that’s pretty paranoid, but that is what I wanted to come across in this, and he done it pretty well. EMMA WARREN So, to make sure this is all clear – basically, this is the one thing with a grime MC on an album? SKREAM That I’ll ever do. EMMA WARREN That you’ll probably ever do. Alright? Play it away. Skream This dubplate has been absolutely hammered, so if it sounds a bit sketchy, that's why. EMMA WARREN What changes for you when you put in a vocal track? SKREAM I tend to still like the beat to be a lot going on because I don’t want the vocal to dominate the track, because then it’s the vocal a lot of the time that makes the track. This is sort of exactly what I wanted. Every word he said is sort of what I had in mind to go over it, and that’s why I picked him, because I thought if there was any person that could sort of hit the nail on the head… EMMA WARREN Do you find that if you put… vocals on there, which sort of lighten things – which isn't the case here – that you compensate other parts of the record to make it darker or harder? SKREAM The instrumental for that was done before I had vocal in mind, so…. EMMA WARREN What about the Warrior Queen one? SKREAM The Warrior Queen thing was so freaky it’s unreal. I’d done this track, and I had in mind getting Warrior Queen on it because I’d done a remix for her label of her. I’d done it, and I had never met her once in my life, then the day I finished it, that evening, I got an email from Warrior Queen’s management saying they were interested in doing a track. And if that ain’t weird, I don’t know what is. It was like a saint sent the company a message. No one had even heard the tune, but I done it with Warrior Queen in mind, like all the space for her and everything. They contacted me that night… that’s how the [track] with Warrior Queen came about. EMMA WARREN I don't suppose you've got… SKREAM I have, but it sounds pretty hammered. EMMA WARREN Pretty hammered. Now, why is that? SKREAM Because people jump over the decks and start reloading tunes when you’re out. Get their hands all over them. EMMA WARREN In fact, I’m glad you mentioned that because I think that’s so funny that whole thing about the scene, when people want to get a rewind, it’s no longer calling for it, it’s that people run up to the decks and press stop. SKREAM It’s sort of my own fault because, at one of the DMZ parties, I done it. There was this quote, “Skream is guilty.” Everyone just seems to start being guilty, leaning over. It can get pretty annoying because it’s like you’re sort of try to play, so you’ve only got an hour set and people keep leaning over and stopping it. I’ve got more than enough to play, so it sometimes gets pretty annoying. You always get one person who keeps doing and keeps doing it, and it’s like, “Go away.” EMMA WARREN How do you deal with that? SKREAM You can’t really deal with it unless you’re going to jump over and knock them out. EMMA WARREN Maybe that’s what the boxing gloves were for! We also want to go talk to you about playing out. DJ Zinc was saying something about how all of the stuff he’s playing, about 80% is unreleased and probably 30% or 40% of that is stuff only he’s got. What are the proportions like for you? SKREAM The same, really. The majority of stuff I play comes out, but I’ll get stuff off other people if it’s never going to come out. It’s just the DJ being exclusive to tracks and being the only person with them. Why are you going to go out and play the same set as someone else? It’s pretty pointless. I think most DJs want an individual sort of set. EMMA WARREN What kind of things… what’s you special special? SKREAM My special, special, special? I don’t know. I’ve got loads. I got loads of stuff. It’s where I am, I've sort of got dibs on anything, I guess, because I know everyone. It’s better to have your own stuff because the other producers are playing out a lot and if you keep playing everyone else’s new stuff, then there’s never going to be no time for your own. EMMA WARREN If you’ve got 80% unreleased, 30% to 40% only that is exclusive to you, how much of your set is going to be you? SKREAM Sixty… 60%. I only really play stuff if I really like it or I know it's stuff someone wants pushed. Let’s say someone’s got a track coming out, then you push it. EMMA WARREN So who else do you play? SKREAM Digital Mystikz, Benga, Antisocial Entertainment which are new – whoever’s into dubstep keep an ear out because they’re pretty good. Iron Soul, he’s another new guy. That’s it really. Loefah. Obviously Digital Mystikz. EMMA WARREN Have you got anything that you can play that’s in your set? SKREAM Yeah. EMMA WARREN It might even be the one that nearly blew my head off on Friday night. SKREAM This is actually for Jeff [gestures to the audience]. (music: Coki – “Burnin’” / applause) That is actually one of my favorite tracks at the minute. It goes down everywhere. Whoever’s heard the original, do you agree with me that it’s better than the original? It’s sick. EMMA WARREN Obviously, you played here on Friday and you played in Brisbane at the weekend. What kind of reaction are you getting to that? SKREAM Friday was better than Saturday, because of… basically down to the smoking laws. People are in and out of the club all night. Reactions everywhere are pretty good. I played a gig in Holland, and I played after some thrash metal drum & bass, and it was like dropping the tempo. I sort of stood there and just really didn’t want to play. It’s just common sense, really. It’s just a bad promoter there. EMMA WARREN Do you think the tempo thing is something that makes it all sound so heavy? SKREAM I think it’s the bass. EMMA WARREN Probably. Tell us a bit about “Midnight Request Line.” I hear that you nearly didn’t do anything with it. SKREAM I’ve done it like literally two Christmases ago. Bored of the festive season. I sat down and just wanted to do something a bit different… it started off, which is weird… I don’t really tell many people… it started off as a grime thing, but then I went a bit more deeper into it. I gave it to a couple people, and everyone was a bit like… because it was the first time I’d really started doing the arpeggiated type of thing. I think it took people quite a while to sort of accept it. About a year or two later, Youngsta started playing it FWD>>, and it started again from there. When I was playing it and it was starting to a get good reaction, then when Youngsta started to play it, it was getting more reactions. Roll Deep, a big grime crew in England were hammering it, which helped sales quite a bit. Then Ricardo Villalobos, a big techno DJ, was playing it, Gilles Peterson was playing it. There was just people that I’ve never even heard of before that was playing it. Then I was finding out after how respected they are. The track’s done me blinding. EMMA WARREN Villalobos has been in touch about you doing a mix, hasn’t he? SKREAM No, he wants to do a mix. EMMA WARREN He wants to do a mix? SKREAM He wants to do a mix of something. We’re not 100% sure yet, but he’s up for it. EMMA WARREN It’s quite funny how, over the last six months, things have suddenly changed from being just there for the people who were in the scene, and suddenly people who were into music generally but aren’t necessary dubstep heads at all have got really into it. I mean, you played festivals over the summer. You must be seeing different people, different musics… SKREAM A lot of techno fans are getting into it. I think people from other genres need a voice to show them, because otherwise, it’s just like, “What are they doing?” sort of thing. When Villalobos played it, it was like, “Alright! If he’s playing it, then we should like it.” Some people need to be force-fed something before they actually accept it. EMMA WARREN Do you reckon that’s it? Do you reckon it's them thinking, “Oh, if someone else is doing it, then it makes it okay”? SKREAM I’m not saying everyone but a lot of the time people need to be voiced things in a certain way. EMMA WARREN Really, in the last six months, loads of really good things have happened but is there anything changing that’s not so good? Or is it all good? SKREAM It’s all good at the minute. The only thing, some of the press are getting some things really wrong. I keep trying to look for some way to put it that’s not actually there. Everyone always assumes there’s a deeper feeling behind something when there’s not. It’s like when you get a four-page essay on a track. It’s like, “Oh yeah! They was thinking this!” It’s like, “No, we weren’t.” It’s just like, “We just write the tunes.” Some of the press is ruining some things. EMMA WARREN Basically, don’t think about it too much? SKREAM Yeah. Don’t think about it too much. Just listen. EMMA WARREN What about some of the other influences to the sounds we talked about. We sort of talked about two-step a little bit and the dark garage thing, but is there anything else that has been influential? SKREAM I listen to a lot of funk, a lot of disco. I’ve been listening to a lot of Goldfrapp and sort of, I don’t what to call it but I’ve been listening to a lot of Hot Chip… They’re pretty cool. They’re different. They’re really different. They use weird sounds that you wouldn’t hear, but they pull them off really well. I’ve been listening to quite a lot of different stuff. EMMA WARREN Is that all feeding into… if you get in to stuff like that, does that feed in directly into what you’re doing? SKREAM Sort of. It’s not that. You just start to look at things in different ways. Then, you start to look at your own music in a different way and you think, “Is someone going to listen to this in ten years, like I’m listening to stuff now?” EMMA WARREN Like what? Is there a concrete example of a way that you thought you discovered something and then it spread [into your work]? SKREAM No. Some of it is just influence, like you just take the music in, and you don’t go back and make a tune like that, you just try and make a tune that gives you the feeling that track gave you, which is a pretty hard thing to do. EMMA WARREN One other thing. We talked a lot for some reason a couple times about nicknames and how they’ve come out. Did someone give you your name or did you do it? SKREAM No. I used to write that tag, so that’s how that come about. And that was before the film was out. EMMA WARREN Have you got something new you can play us? SKREAM Yeah. This is off the album. This is the tune that was the weird one, when they got in contact with me after. (music: Skream – “Check It” (Vocal Mix) / applause) EMMA WARREN That sounded good. SKREAM Also, I’ve done that because there seems to be a lot more girls coming out and there weren’t really nothing… you know, all girls like a sing-along. You know you do [laughs]. It was just to show them I appreciate them coming out. EMMA WARREN I think, really… we’re going to go over to some questions on the floor in the minute, but I don’t want to finish this without pointing out that you like to have a good time, don’t you? SKREAM I do. Who doesn’t? EMMA WARREN I think we’ve noticed already this kind of Skream Team kind of chaos that seems to occur around you. Is that part of the reason why the music sounds so good? It’s good-time music. SKREAM Some people say that it’s not. You get a lot of… some people like to put it down, but I just like having a good time. It’s actually really got nothing to do with the music. It’s just me in general. I just like me enjoying myself. It’s like, who wants to go out and have a bad night? EMMA WARREN Not you, that’s for sure. SKREAM Not me. EMMA WARREN Who’s got some questions? OK. Where’s the microphone? AUDIENCE MEMBER I got a couple of questions. Who does your mastering? SKREAM Transition. Transition Mastering. Very good. If anyone wants the address or anything, they can come and get it after. AUDIENCE MEMBER Also I’m just following up on that in the mastering process, the digital to analog. SKREAM To be honest, I’m not fully… I wouldn’t be able to fully explain all that side of it to you. I’m just the software boy. Anything else? AUDIENCE MEMBER No, that’s it. AUDIENCE MEMBER [inaudible] SKREAM Yeah. FL Studio. AUDIENCE MEMBER [inaudible]. SKREAM No, I only use FL Studio and lots of software plug-ins and stuff. Just anything I can make a bassline on, really. The thing is, everyone is a bit prejudiced when it comes to Fruity Loops because it’s so simple, people seem to have a problem with it, but why? If I can do in that what some people can do in Logic, then why not? It’s my little playground that I sort of know like the back of my hand, so why not? I can do the same in it what a lot of people can do in Cubase and Logic. The only bad thing with Fruity Loops is it’s not 24-bit. As soon as it’s 24-bit, then I think that’s Mac out the window for me. EMMA WARREN OK, any others? We got a question in the back there. We’re down to one mic. AUDIENCE MEMBER Hi. Where do you get your basslines from? SKREAM Anything. AUDIENCE MEMBER Fruity Loops? SKREAM No, it’s not in Fruity Loops. It’s anything. You can make a bass from anything. Anything you can make a bass from. They’re just tones. It’s more of getting the sound you want than how to make a bass more… if you know what I mean. If that makes any sense whatsoever. AUDIENCE MEMBER No, it does. It’s just because your bass is really solid, that’s all. SKREAM It’s not necessarily the bass sound, it’s the frequencies you’re cutting and the frequencies you’re pushing into the bass. You can make a bassline… if you don’t compress it, don’t EQ it or what-not, it can start sounding pretty weak. Do you know what I mean? Then, when you try and over-compress or over-EQ, you can always do something with it. It’s just getting the balance right, really. It’s just getting everything its own space within the actual sound. That’s why I tend not to overcut the music sort of thing. AUDIENCE MEMBER Hi. How are you? [inaudible] what kind of speakers are you using because ... SKREAM To be honest, I’ve got some really wack old Tannoys that someone bought me for Christmas. I think it helps because it’s the sort of thing someone’s going to listen to the radio through, and the way a lot of my tunes are getting played on radio, I think that helps because they’re not the best speakers, they’re just some Tannoys, but if I can get a nice mix down on them, then I know it’s going to sound nice coming from really nice speakers. Well, I hope so anyway. They’re just really old, really bait. EMMA WARREN That’s avoiding that dilemma of your records sounding amazing in the studio and not working unless you got those sort of speakers. SKREAM The thing is you never really know how your track’s going to sound until you’ve heard it in like four or five different places anyway. EMMA WARREN Who’s next on the question front? AUDIENCE MEMBER I just wanted to touch a little on more of the bass thing. If you’re not using amazing speakers and you were talking a little bit more about harmonics, do you have a preferred EQ in something that you’ve been using, or how did you go about figuring it out? SKREAM To be honest, a lot of EQs all work the same. It’s just sort of where you’re cutting certain things and pushing others. I tend to cut my basses at 30 where a lot of other people cut them at 40. If you’re playing on a good system, it would normally reach as low as 20Hz. You might as well get the full impact out of it, if you’re going to play it. EMMA WARREN Who’s next? I think you’ve got another one. No? Alright. Any other questions? AUDIENCE MEMBER What do you think about singers in dubstep music? SKREAM I wouldn’t really like it to go into the full-on vocal lot. Say, an eight-bar before the drop or something would be nice. I’d like someone else to do it because that can be their thing almost, but it’s not really my thing. The Warrior Queen thing I really liked. It reminds me of an old dubplate. I could imagine someone playing it and that I really would have been feeling it. It sounds pretty freestyle. It doesn’t sound like there’s too much effort going into the recording for the vocal. EMMA WARREN Anything else? No, that’s it? Alright, then. Skream, thank you very much.

Steve Beckett
Since its inception in 1989, Warp Records has become one of England’s most influential and respected modern record labels. Founded in Sheffield by Steve Beckett and the late Rob Mitchell, Warp tapped into the raw power of acid house and rave to fashion a distinctive visual and sonic aesthetic that attracted local, national and international talent and interest. With the release of the Artificial Intelligence compilation and album series in 1992 Warp began its second phase, fashioning new understandings for dance music and bringing forth some its best known artists including Aphex Twin, Autechre and the Black Dog. In 2000, the label moved to London and began its third phase, moving into films and expanding its roster to encompass such seemingly wide ranging, yet related, artists as Prefuse 73, Broadcast and Clark.
In this lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, Warp founder Steve Beckett recalled the early days and inspirations of the label, how it has remained independent despite changing times and how he came to find two of his biggest recent artists in the folds of the Academy.
Hosted by Benji B Time to welcome our next guest, Mr. Steve Beckett [applause]. Steve Beckett Thank you. Benji B And where have you come from? Steve Beckett I’ve just come in from London a few days ago. Benji B How was your flight? Steve Beckett It was fantastic. You’ve looked after me well, I’m in a nice suite looking over the water. Benji B For those who might not be aware what you do for a living, and have been doing for a while, can you please fill us in? Steve Beckett My name is Steve Beckett. I’m the MD of Warp Records and Warp Films. I started the label from my bedroom 17 years ago, and luckily I’m still here today. I don’t know how we’ve managed to survive, but we have done, and I’m really proud of the musical history we’ve got so far and I hope we’re going to continue to do that. Benji B So you’ve been running an independent record label for 17 years. I think that, in itself, deserves a round of applause. (Applause) In this day and age that’s truly incredible. What’s the secret? Steve Beckett The secret is signing incredible artists who’ve got a vision about where they’re going and have mastered the instruments for whatever form they’re working in, so the instruments and technology don’t get in the way of their personality – so the personality of Aphex Twin or Boards Of Canada start uniquely coming through the music they’re creating, so people can hear that direct emotional contact with the artist, rather than just hearing what the equipment is. There’s a real danger with modern electronic music that sometimes the equipment can get in the way. I think that’s a key part of why we’ve been successful. The other side of it is the so-called boring stuff that a lot of labels don’t take seriously, like the accounting and paying people, paying people that you’re booking studios from or the crews you’re using for the tours. All that’s taken care of so the artist will be supported and knows he’ll get paid and make a living from what he loves doing. We’ve got a great reputation and I’m sure Mark [Pritchard] will confirm this, but we’re one of the few labels that actually pay people right on the dot when we say we will and really clearly account to them, so we’re still working with artists we’ve been working with for 17 years, like Nightmares On Wax or LFO, Autechre and Aphex Twin… we’ve been working with those guys for ten years. That’s a key part of why we’re successful. I always look to the future and try not get to stuck in the way the music business is going. The music business at the moment has such a negative, paranoid fear about what’s coming in the future, but I haven’t got any fear at all. We’re looking into the future really positively about the way music is going to be enjoyed and used by people, and we’re making moves to make sure our artists are taking advantage of that, too, rather than putting our heads in the sand and hoping nobody downloads music and saying it shouldn’t be like that. It is like that, and we’ve got to adapt to the way ahead. Benji B You started one of the very first electronic download sites, can you tell us about that? Steve Beckett Not just that, we started one of the first label sites, selling CDs and physical vinyl through the internet. That was probably about 12 years ago. We weren’t even using emails at that time, but somebody told me there was this thing called the internet and you could go on it and surf. It took us about ten hours to get on it and surfing was the most miserable experience. I’d imagined these sort of virtual-reality suits, where I could go and have virtual sex with people, but it was like watching a newsgroup talking about a Black Dog 12” for fucking two hours. We were there really early, but as soon as I realized everyone would be connected I saw that would be the future of music. So, straight away we built a website, telling people about the catalogue. Then we started to physically sell CDs and vinyl, and then five or six years later made the move to sell downloads. Benji B And what’s that website called? Steve Beckett The website is warprecords.com and the download site is bleep.com and we’re selling other labels’ catalogues as well. Benji B And how have you seen that progress over the last few years? Steve Beckett It’s like anything, it starts off really slowly. If you’re ahead of the game, you’re waiting for people to catch up. Now, it’s really taking off and between Warp Mart and Bleep it’s probably about 25% of our turnover. If we hadn’t done that, we’d probably be in trouble now, like a lot of other labels are. But we’ve just had our two biggest years, which is definitely due to those moves we made ten years ago. Benji B You’ve spoken about the artists on the label. What was your vision and your ethic when you started it? Steve Beckett When we first started we were running a small shop in Sheffield, a tiny thing about the size of the corner of that room. Benji B What year was that? Steve Beckett The shop was about 1986, and at that time we were doing rock music and a little bit of dance music, but mainly hip-hop. Then about 1987, ‘88 all the Transmat stuff started coming over and the Nu Groove and Big Shot and all these exciting labels from the States and it really pricked up our ears. To us it was a musical revolution, and we kept hearing about this strange drug called ecstasy that we were all trying to get our hands on. Then the whole scene took off with the imports coming into the shop and with massive warehouse parties of 3,000 people; completely illegal, no lights whatsoever, huge sound systems, 25 foot high. All you’d hear was bass and everyone completely off their heads with all the gangsters selling tickets to get in. It was an amazing time. [Laughter and applause] I was completely off my nut, it was like “Jailhouse Rock,” you know when you see those metal walkways and people on them dancing their heads off and the whole thing is starting to collapse? It was so dangerous but you just think this is great, and then the police turn up with their dogs and clear everybody out, with them all off their heads on ecstasy trying to hug the dogs. What were we talking about? Benji B I think you’re talking about an era, and that sounds like it sums up an era for you. Steve Beckett There wasn’t much vision at that time. The vision for the label, we’re right in the middle of this revolution and all these DJs would come into the shop, buying their tunes for the weekend, but at the same time they’re all trying to make their own tracks. You’d get people like Nightmares On Wax and DJ Martin from LFO coming in with their own tunes, and we’d try them out in the club at the weekend and the audience would go insane. So, it just seemed like the right time to press up 500 records, hire a car, drive around the country and try to sell them. Benji B What was that first record? Steve Beckett Forgemasters “Track With No Name.” Benji B And how long did that creative period last for you? Steve Beckett About 20 years [laughs]. No, probably about ten years. Around ‘88, ‘89 was the whole northern house scene, bands like 808 State and Unique 3, and we had Forgemasters and LFO and Nightmares On Wax, and those guys who were just dominating the scene at the time. Benji B Sheffield is in the north of England, just to place it for you geographically. What were you listening to before dance and rave culture hit the UK? Steve Beckett We were listening to a lot of indie rock, avant-garde stuff, or Danzig, Black Flag, people like that. Then we were just starting to pick up on some of the hip-hop stuff as well, Eric B & Rakim, EPMD and those guys. That was just starting to open our heads up to different sounds. Benji B Do you want to play us something from the early days of the label? Steve Beckett I’ll play a rarely heard B-side from Nightmares On Wax that used to absolutely destroy people. (music: Nightmares On Wax – “I’m For Real” / applause) Benji B Who was that? Steve Beckett That was Nightmares On Wax. Benji B … who were one of the first signings to the label? Steve Beckett They were the second signing, yeah. Benji B Do you want to tell us some of the artists you signed in that early period? Steve Beckett We signed Sweet Exorcist, which was Rob Gordon and Richard Kirk who used to be in Cabaret Voltaire. We signed Nightmares On Wax and LFO from Leeds. We did a lot of different offshoots with those guys, but they were the main artists at that point. Benji B And a lot of them stayed with you for many years. Steve Beckett Those are all still with us. George from Nightmares is living in his villa in Ibiza and Mark Bell is still making music, he just produced the last Björk album. He’s still doing well, but he doesn’t do as much music for us as I’d like him to. Benji B One of the biggest recordings, one that made me aware of the label, was the self-titled “LFO” track. Did that have a huge impact when it came out? Steve Beckett That was the one that turned us into a “real label”. We just weren’t really prepared for what would happen with that record. It was at the time when a single could come out and keep sneaking up and up; at first it was just into the top 40, next week it was in the top 20, then it was 12. We sold 130,000 12”s, which was just unbelievable, you’d get the same position now from selling 3,000. Shall I give you a blast of that? (music: LFO – “LFO” / applause) Steve Beckett A lot of people get confused with the sound of that time, they think it’s all about the bleeps. But it was nothing to do with the bleeps for the people making it, it was all about the bass. There’d be ten or 15 versions of that song for testing it out in the clubs. We had this cut-off section where everybody had drinks, and then the main dancefloor, which had a window, and if you were on the other side and could hear the window shaking, you knew you had the right frequencies for the bass. And the same thing with the mastering, too, because everything was around vinyl at that time, we had this great guy who’d give us as deep a cut as possible. You used to have the limiters on the mastering lathe to protect the cutting heads to stop the temperature going too high, or you’d lose these £20,000 cutting heads. But he used to take the limiters off for us and we’d stand there watching the temperature get as high as he thought he could get away with before taking it off, because he was afraid of tripping it out. He’d do loads of different cuts to get the maximum bass we could possibly get. I don’t think people really comprehend the amount of time and effort that went into making these basslines so people’s balls would shake [laughs]. That was the attitude. But it was a great time, that record blew us up into a different level. Benji B And how did things change at that point? Steve Beckett We all started wearing suits and ties, getting the accountants in and making it real. No, it was more like the lights going on and realizing we could have a long-term vision for the label. And I think the key was – and we did this with LFO – having had the background of the record shop, we’d really seen the difference between the rock labels and dance labels. Dance labels would come along and be very trendy for a year, and then no one would be interested. But with the rock labels we looked up to from the indie side, like Mute and Factory, they had a whole look and really developed the artists, recording albums, sending them out on tour. We took that model and applied it to dance music, so LFO were the first people we worked with where we were, “Come on, guys. You’ve got to make an album.” They were like, “Why do we need to make an album? We just do 12”s for people to dance to.” But it was really getting that into their heads, then them going into the studio and making albums they realized could work electronically, like Kraftwerk or Pink Floyd or Tangerine Dream, making electronic albums people could appreciate from start to finish, rather than just being one-off dance records. Benji B Factory is from the north of England, too, and some of the artists you mentioned are from Leeds and Sheffield. It’s all from the north. How important was it for you to represent that scene? Was there a north/south divide on the party scene? Steve Beckett There was a terrible divide, we were just convinced the south hadn’t got a clue what was going on. There was a time when it had gone from house music into rare groove, but we weren’t interested in rare groove, we were into acid house. We’d have all these guys come up from London going, “House music’s over, we’re all into rare groove down there.” “This isn’t house, this is acid house, just listen to it.” Then gradually, the whole thing took off, just these huge parties, that’s what we were into; a definite north/south divide. Benji B How many people at your average party? Steve Beckett Anywhere from 500 to 2,000. It was all the football hooligans, the ecstasy had started getting into the football hooligans, and instead of going out and getting hammered on beer and fighting, they were suddenly selling all the Es, hugging each other and having a good time. There was a real edgy feel to it. I remember going to this blues club, you walk into it, there’s a shotgun, someone sticks the shotgun in your face, then just smiles, pulls the gun down and blows smoke in your face. There was shit like that going on all the time [laughs]. Benji B What were the records and artists from the US that were influencing DJs at the time? Steve Beckett It was all about labels back then, so first there was Big Shot from Canada that was a massive label, then Nu Groove and later on Transmat. Trax, of course, when “Acid Trax” came in, that changed everything. Benji B Did you work with those artists? Steve Beckett Not really. Network from Birmingham tended to do that, they were licensing a lot of stuff from the States, whereas we were more interested in finding the people who were hearing that sound, but putting their own unique spin on it. Benji B When you realized the sales were going through the roof, how did you make the decisions of who to sign and how to develop the artists? It seems unlike many independent labels there was a great deal of investment going in. Steve Beckett Even though it was new music, we were coming at it from a rock angle. So we encouraged them to go out on tour and put a great live show together, do videos and press interviews and photos: very much marketing it in a rock way, where you send the band out for six months to a year and have singles to support it. That’s the way we worked it, then other artists saw that they were making a career from it and got it into their heads. It seems obvious now, but at that time people weren’t interested in doing it, they were just doing 12”s. Benji B At that period in the ‘90s there started being dance music subsidiaries of major labels and some indies were bought up. Did you get the calls? Steve Beckett I remember getting a call from Richard Branson’s right-hand man at Virgin, and getting us up into the top rooms. I remember he had pictures of all his sports cars on the wall, like Aston Martin. I thought, “If these are the things he’s proud of collecting… where are all the artists?” It just didn’t feel like it was right for us, we were very independent-minded. Benji B Has it been hard over 17 years resisting those phone calls over time? Steve Beckett When you first start off you get a lot of calls, but when you’ve been going as long as us, there’s no one who’s just going to pick up the phone and say, “Hey, do you want to sell your label?” It just doesn’t happen. It’s more that we get a call from a major saying, “Why the fuck are you trying to sign this artist? Keep away from them.” Benji B As we get into the ‘90s, can you tell us about some of the artists who came along? Steve Beckett Obviously, we came through at the end of this musical revolution, and it felt like it was repeating itself. What was interesting for me was when you were coming back from the clubs at four or five in the morning and people were playing tracks they’d made themselves that weren’t necessarily intended for the dancefloor. I started realizing these tracks were appearing on B sides, and you’d get these artists like B12 and Black Dog and Polygon Window and Autechre and Aphex Twin, people sending tapes in, who were making music that had a reference to dance music but wasn’t aimed at the dancefloor, they were more for listening. There was a scene there, and that’s when I started putting together this compilation called Artificial Intelligence. That was the second phase of the label, where we signed Aphex Twin, Autechre, Black Dog and B12, and we went onto a different level, because these artists became really respected in their own right making real cutting-edge music that was pushing the boundaries of electronic music. Shall I play a B12 track? (music: B12 – “Telefone 529”) Benji B Do you want to talk a bit about Plaid and Black Dog, because over the years they’ve consistently come up with more and more inspiring stuff, and they’ve also done a lot of work with Björk? Steve Beckett Yeah, I can’t remember how Björk got involved with them. I think she just heard some of their music and became obsessed with them and took them on tour with her, and they produced some of her songs as well. But then they split… so there was Ken Downie, who was the third member of Black Dog, and they sort of fell out, and Ed [Handley] and Andy went onto become Plaid and recorded a number of albums with us. Benji B Who was the other artist you mentioned from the Artificial Intelligence comp? Steve Beckett Aphex Twin [laughs]? Obviously, his career just blew up. He’d done Ambient Works 2 and a Polygon Window album with us. He’d done Ambient Works 1, sorry, and a Polygon Window album and then did Ambient Works 2, which was the album that took him onto a different level. It was so different from anything he’d done before. It was completely ambient, no track titles whatsoever, and he made the whole thing while forcing himself to lucid dream. He was putting himself in these tough situations where he couldn’t sleep, so you’d be sitting with him and he’s falling asleep while he’s sitting with you. Then he’d get up in the middle of the night and forcing himself into these dream states. Then in that state he’d write these songs and force himself to remember them when he was awake. From Ambient Works 2 onwards, his career went to a different level. Then after that, there was the big Chris Cunningham video, so we did a single called “Come To Daddy,” which took him to another level, and then he did “Windowlicker” – the video and the music became one thing, much to his annoyance. People would come up to him and say: “I love your video.” “It’s not my fucking video, I didn’t make it.” Aphex Twin became one of the biggest artists we’d worked with at that time and one of the defining artists for the label. What I love about Aphex, and I’m sure a lot of other people do, is it’s not necessarily the A sides or the tracks that he’s known for, but to me it’s all the little B sides and the tracks that are tucked away, where he’s really pushing the boundaries of his own abilities. This track I’m going to play you, “Bucephalus Bouncing Ball” … I don’t know if we’re out of sync in terms of timing, but to me it just sums up his creativity and the way he’s pushing the boundaries of the equipment he’s working with. Most people who know his work don’t necessarily know these B-sides, but I just think this is an incredible record. (music: Aphex Twin – “Bucephalus Bouncing Ball” / applause) Steve Beckett It would be rude to fade that one, wouldn’t it? Benji B Actually, I was just talking to Marco [Passarani] about when Aphex plays in Italy, and also in the UK the other day. I don’t think there’s anyone else working in electronic music who has so much hysteria surrounding them. Can you talk about the cult of Aphex and when did that start to emerge and how did it affect you as a label? Steve Beckett It began when he was doing interviews. He was getting so bored with interviews, because he was doing so many, that he’d entertain himself by throwing little myths in there about whatever, owning a nuclear bunker or living in the middle of a roundabout in the middle of the Elephant and Castle. Gradually, these things started gaining more and more momentum, so he’d start adding to it. But then you’d get the things that were real, like he really did buy a tank and have it down at his place in Wales. So, you’d just get all these weird myths and all these obsessive people turning up. Like, he’d be doing the wires for his plugs and if the equipment wasn’t working he’d leave them on the side of the stage, and these people would be picking them up and taking these pieces bit of wire back. Just weird shit like that, people turning up to his house. The best one was, he was living in this bank in the Elephant and Castle, in this disused bank, and there’d be these old security windows. And you’d get tourists, coming up, tracking him down to where he lived, they’d put their faces right up to the window and wouldn’t be able to see anything, but he could see them. He’d stick his face right up to the window and suddenly this ghostly Aphex figure would come out of the darkness and disappear again. He used to enjoy things like that. Benji B You mentioned Chris Cunningham who did the Aphex videos. Tell us about Warp Films and when you started working with Chris. And you did some work with Chris Morris, too, is that right? Steve Beckett Yeah, we were making videos for a lot of the artists, and we realized that some of the people we were making them with, like Chris Cunningham, had similar personalities to the artists that we were dealing with. People thought they were weird or so-called difficult to work with, but they weren’t, they were just pushing the boundaries of what they were doing and just knowing exactly what they wanted, and they expected other people to step up to the plate for whatever they wanted to deliver. They couldn’t see any point in stepping back from an edge that they could see, they wanted to get to that edge they imagined they could hit. We realized we could get the relationships with these sorts of directors and make films as well as the music we were doing. It just seemed like a similar situation to when we started the label ten years before. The technology was changing so that people could make much lower-budget digital films, and we could actually get involved in those technologies and create our own, at first short films and now feature films. Benji B And what are the feature films you’ve been working on more recently? Steve Beckett We’ve just finished two features films with Shane Meadows, which are Dead Man’s Shoes and This Is England, and we’ve got another five going, with different new directors, basically. Benji B And what’s your role in that? Steve Beckett Similar to what it is in the label, really. I’ve got ten people working in the film company. It’s seeing what the talent is that we want to work with, looking at scripts and directors. None of the day-to-day. Benji B Following Artificial Intelligence and the albums from Autechre and Black Dog and Aphex Twin and loads of 12”s in the ‘90s, there was what some people might call a change of direction, others might see as expanding the horizons. You started doing more live music, more organic live recorded music; what some people might call indie or rock. When did you make the decision to go in that direction? Steve Beckett I think it was after Artificial Intelligence 2, when I was talking to my partner Rob and we realized we couldn’t just keep doing Now That’s What I Call Artificial Intelligence 3, 4 and 5, just doing the same thing. I’d always wanted to push boundaries and keep working in different areas. I started from an indie rock shop back in ’86-’87, so it seemed like a natural progression for us to work with other artists who had different influences but still had roots in electronic music. I think Broadcast and Seefeel were some of the first acts we worked with who knew the whole history of musique concrète and [Bernard] Parmegiani and Stockhausen and John Cage and Steve Reich and all these great classical avant-garde composers, but they were using all those influences and bringing it into a rock environment. When I heard it, it seemed to totally fit the ethos of the label and they seemed to fit with the other acts we were working with. Benji B And where were Broadcast from? Steve Beckett Birmingham. (music: Broadcast – “Echo’s Answer” / applause) Benji B How was that received when it came out? Steve Beckett It was like people in the know knew they were an absolutely incredible band, but with the journalists and the media, it sort of went over their heads. As a label, that can be really frustrating. Sometimes you’ve got great music and it lands at exactly the right time when you’ve got this wave of enthusiasm for a particular sound. Other times you’ve got great music and you release it when there’s this wave of enthusiasm in the media about some other genre or hip thing. Obviously, from the media perspective, they need new stuff because they don’t want to be writing the same old, same old about a new band, it’s just not that exciting for them. Broadcast are one of the acts who, when I’m signing a new band, they want to be on Warp because Broadcast are – it’s always either Broadcast or Aphex – so they’re one of those musicians’ bands. There’s a lot of depth and subtlety to the music. With the English media, [music has got to be in people’s] faces and they’ve got to get it in five seconds or they don’t really talk about it. But they’re one of my favorite bands on the label, and I’m so proud we’re working with them. Benji B And have they got a new record coming out? Steve Beckett They’re finishing one off now, they’re really slow workers so they really go through it when they’re releasing an album. It’s like a four-year birth period, they’re just in total agony going through it. Every time they say the next one will be easy, it’s not going to be like this, but it’s always like this. I think it’s some sort of karmic obligation of an artist, that you’ve got to go this self-searching place to deliver this piece of new creativity that wouldn’t have existed if you hadn’t gone through that experience. That’s part of the job of you guys to go through that. Benji B Tell us about some of the others on the label. Steve Beckett There’s the lost hero Jimi Tenor and Jamie Lidell. I don’t know if any of you guys have seen Jamie Lidell live, he’s just an incredible force. I’ll play you one of his tracks. (music: Jamie Lidell – “A Little Bit More” / applause) Benji B We should talk about Jamie, because you seem to find these artists that are completely unique. There’s definitely only one Jamie Lidell, anyone who’s managed to see him live, he really takes the whole live electronic performance to another level. Steve Beckett When you start off, you don’t necessarily have a big attraction to these artists, but obviously now we have a track record with these sorts of maverick people. We’re maybe one of the first places people will come to for a deal. So, if you’ve got somebody like that and you see him live… I’d just fly anywhere in the world and hold onto his ankles to try and sign someone like that. It’s a no-brainer for me, if you meet someone as talented as that, you want to work with him. Benji B And let’s talk about Jimi Tenor. Steve Beckett Another unsung hero. Benji B What’s it like working with him? Steve Beckett Same again, really. People like that just totally push you. We recorded this album called Out Of Nowhere and Jimi said he wanted this 30-piece orchestra. We said there’s no way we can afford that. But Jimi said: “I’ve found the orchestra, they’re in Poland. We need to go over there and record the album.” He actually made it happen. He’s a real character. I saw him come on stage in Spain on a white horse with a red cape and transvestites on either side of the stage. He likes to put on a good show. This is one of the tracks that came out from that recording in Poland. (music: Jimi Tenor – “Better Than Ever” / applause) Steve Beckett We could play records for five hours solid. Vincent Gallo is another incredible person to work with, and there are still other great electronic artists coming through. Around that time we signed Squarepusher, who was doing what we felt was our slant on drum & bass. A lot of drum & bass felt too straight for the Warp label, but then this freak called Squarepusher started coming out of the scene. He had the depth of musical knowledge, and had that link into musique concrète. Obviously, he was an incredible bassist, so he had that real musicality. He was someone I really wanted to work with, and obviously after that we worked with Boards Of Canada as well. Benji B Play Boards Of Canada… Steve Beckett I’ll play maybe one Boards Of Canada track and one Squarepusher. We could go for ever, but then we’ll open it up to questions, yeah? Where’s Squarepusher? This is just another 12” he did, but I love this tune. (music: Squarepusher – “Venus No 17”) Then we’ll maybe just do one Boards track, can’t not do a Boards track. (music: Boards Of Canada – unknown / applause) Benji B So, that’s Boards Of Canada. Steve Beckett That is Boards Of Canada. Benji B Highly recommended. One question I suddenly thought of while I was listening to that: is there any artist that you really wanted to sign over the years but couldn’t, didn’t get to? Is there anyone that you wished you’d signed, in hindsight? Steve Beckett Reload. The first Reload album, that should’ve been on Warp, for sure. Absolute classic. Benji B Pritchard! Pritchard! Steve Beckett But he’d already, unfortunately signed to ... Actually, we tried to get you to sign us before you’d signed to, who are you on? Infinite? Mark Pritchard Yeah. Steve Beckett Yeah, so we tried to sign this guy but it was too late. One of the forerunners of Artificial Intelligence but it didn’t get half the praise that it should’ve got. Unique 3 as well, we tried to sign them. They’d done this classic track called “The Theme” which was really the first bleep track that pricked everybody else’s ears up. Then newer acts, things like ... I would’ve loved to sign Kraftwerk. Then there’s a few acts, things like… Godspeed You! Black Emperor, we tried to sign. I followed them around the world but couldn’t make it happen really. There’s always acts that you’d love to sign that you don’t. It’s one of those unique situations that a lot of the artists that we sign to really want to sign to us as long as we can get a deal that works and they can make a career out of. We can usually get the deal compared to a major because we’re… all of our artists are on a 50/50 royalty deal. Even though at first the royalties come for a bit slower than maybe they’d come… well they’d never come through on a major anyway [laughs]. They might come through slow at first but then after a few years you start getting this flow through of royalties from your back catalog. Like I said, we’re working with the artists that we’ve been working with for 17 years so they really can make a career out of doing quite strange music on a 50/50 deal. [Applause] Benji B What’s the signing process when you want to sign an act? In terms of creative discussion with the team around you. We should probably talk about your partner in the business, Rob, who sadly passed in 2001. Steve Beckett Oh at that time, we were both doing the A&R. Usually getting recommendations from people around you. Especially… the best recommendations I’ve got are from artists on the label. So, somebody like Aphex would bring in Squarepusher. Prefuse 73 brought in Battles and literally just went, put the mobile phone to their number going, “Sign this band, sign this band now!” It’s very much like ... looking at people’s taste that you really respect and then obviously checking out the music yourself and seeing if you truly relate to it. That’s the first step. If you don’t even relate to it I don’t take it any further. Then after that I’d go and either meet the artist or talk to them on the phone and just see what their long-term vision is for their career. See if they’ve got anything… I can just usually see it in their eyes if they’re the sort of people I want to work with really. Benji B Would you like to talk about Rob Mitchell for a moment? Steve Beckett Rob was my partner for 12 years at the label and then in 2001 he got diagnosed with cancer. He got diagnosed two weeks after his wedding, and six months later he died of cancer. Still got really fond memories of him. We totally built the label up together working every day for 12 years. It was a huge change for me and all the artists and all the staff that were working with us. He was very much like a brother. A lot of the artists, we divided the roster between the two people, so suddenly all the artists were being taken care of by me. It was like a sort of doubling of the workload just in a week. It was a really tough period, but also I’d just say it’s the most important event that ever happened in my life because I was actually with him when he died. It just really put my life into perspective and made me realize what was important, which is just putting love and creativity out into the world and nothing else really matters. That sounds like a cliche but when you’re actually facing death it’s like those cliches just become real. [Applause] Benji B Before we open the questions up to the floor, we should talk about Warp in 2007. I know that Mark [Pritchard] has an EP coming out soon. Steve Beckett He’s got an EP and an album hopefully. [Laughs/applause] We’ve also signed an act who did the Red Bull Music Academy last year called Flying Lotus. [Applause] Benji B Now, one of the tracks on the EP actually features a vocalist who was part of the Red Bull Music Academy in Melbourne and I believe that track was actually recorded at the Academy. Steve Beckett You’re not charging us anything for that, are you? And we’re talking to another guy here, Hudson Mohawke, who hopefully can get a deal penned this week. [Applause] So yeah, there’s some good stuff coming out of here, as far as we’re concerned. Benji B It’s cool that the area of hip-hop-tempo music via the electronic side, you’ve put out stuff from Anti-Pop Consortium, Prefuse 73 and now Flying Lotus… Steve Beckett And Harmonic 33. Benji B You seem to be supporting that side as well, which is really positive. Steve Beckett It’s not about supporting it, I just love that sort of music. When we started the shop all we were selling before the house really took off was hip-hop, so I feel like it’s really in my blood. The artists, too, someone like Autechre, even though people who hear them would imagine them as just being anal electronic kids, they’re B-boys. They were tagging when they were fucking 11 years old round Manchester. They totally know their hip-hop and that sort of funk of hip-hop is underlying a lot of their beats, that fusion of musique concrète and really experimental music. That’s what I love about bands like that, bringing it into the present day with Prefuse 73, Harmonic 33, Flying Lotus and Hudson Mohawke. It’s just got that funk in the music and that rawness, and I love being able to bring that into electronic music. A lot of the electronic music I don’t like – it’s just too timid, not really taking its own space. Benji B Is Lex a subsidiary of Warp? Steve Beckett We started Lex but I’ve sold it back to him now. (music: Flying Lotus – “Massage Situation” / applause) Benji B Alright, any questions? Steve Beckett I’ve got to play one more thing, which is the latest signing, Battles. I don’t know if any of you guys have heard this, this fucking band is unbelievable… making really experimental music but with traditional guitars, drums and vocals… Benji B Battles, yeah? Where are they from? Steve Beckett Battles are from New York, incredible live band as well. (music: Battles – “Leyendecker” / applause) Benji B Is that one out or coming out? Steve Beckett This is out. Audience member First of all, thank you. It’s been very interesting to go from acid house to Flying Lotus. I guess you’re trying to share your vision of music. My question is, you pointed out that the key of success can be, most of the time, surfing on a wave and kind of getting your stuff at the right moment, right? But I want to know, for you, what is the key of a long-term vision? Quality and no compromise or something like that? Steve Beckett You mean the long-term vision of an artist or of the label? Steve Beckett More like the label. Yes. To survive in the long-term vision, not just be the fashionable label for a year and then disappear. You pointed out that it happens a lot, and you’ve been there for quite a long time now. Steve Beckett I think it’s back to that original question that we said right at the start of their talk which is… the key to it is two things. Which is, one, making sure that the artist that I’m getting into a relationship with have got a complete mastery of whatever equipment or instrumentation they’re using so that it no longer gets in the way of who they truly are trying to uniquely express themselves. So, if I can sign an artist that’s got a real authenticity to him or her that’s also completely unique, which I just believe everybody’s got that unique thread if they can get the mastering whatever instrumentation they’re using out of the way, people will feel that unique connection to yourself. That’s the first thing. Secondly, is all the other side, the business side at the other end which is just the simple thing that most labels seem to forget. Which is paying the people that are making the money. It’s almost like labels a lot of the time look at an artist as if they’re doing you a favor. Like throwing you a few crumbs while they pay their staff or whatever. It’s completely the other way around –we see ourselves we’re at service of the artist. Obviously, we have our arguments if we have a different vision about where we think they might go. At the end of the day I always want to sell as many records or make as much money for me and them as possible. Sometimes they don’t necessarily want to do that. I think those are the two key things for me. audience member Vision and organization. Thank you. audience member Hello. Thanks for informing us of that info. Also, when Squarepusher came to Melbourne for the first time it just blew me away. It was amazing. I just got a question regarding for artists like us that may have small labels interested in signing our tunes, like small independent labels. What should we be looking for as artists in terms of which label we choose, asking for advances, contracts, those types of things? Steve Beckett Obviously, it’s just case by case, so it just really depends on who you’re dealing with. You want to be asking yourselves… Are you talking about if you’re taking your music to another label? audience member I just had ... I write drum & bass and there are a few small set of labels that want to sign certain tunes and just deciding which label I should choose. Should I be asking for advances? Those types of things. Steve Beckett Well, obviously, the first thing I’d do is just contacting the labels that you feel have got other artists on the label that are… you have some sort of affinity with. Then I’d ask those artists on the labels if they’ve got a good relationship with that label. Then, in terms of contracts, just if it’s a small, low-key thing where you’re just doing one 12”, or something like that, then chances are you’re probably not going to get an advance. If they are offering an advance, take it. If you can get it higher, get it higher. It’s just that thing, if it’s in your pocket it’s safe. If it’s not in your pocket it’s safe for the other people. You just have to take a sense on how trustable the people are that you’re dealing with. Also, if they’ve got a track record of doing good work with other people. Make sure it’s totally non-exclusive and you’ve just given those tracks. It’s not necessarily a long-term thing unless it’s somebody who’s got a real strong reputation. audience member All right, thank you. audience member Hey, that was great man. I’m from New Zealand and my old band, we did it independently for seven years. An EP, released two albums that are kind of gold back home. In a territory the size of New Zealand, it’s four million people, it’s kind of feasible to do it independently. How hard was it in the UK and stuff to be an independent label when you’ve got the majors there in terms of distribution? I was out in the UK last year with a band that signed to Parlophone from home and got a bit of an insight to how the majors do it. It seems to be really cliquey with if you’ve got the booking agent, you can’t get into venues and play festivals, unless the right people put you onto it. Even in radio you can’t get the right radio plugger. How does that mean for you, as an independent label, to kind of break through those establishments, the boys’ club? Steve Beckett It’s still difficult, especially on the live circuit, because the live circuit is just getting more and more sewn up. You’ve got the big agents who, obviously, they’ll put the headline act on, so say it’s, I don’t know, Metallica or something… they control that billing then, and so they’re obviously, they’re not going to put your band on that’s some little indie agent’s. They’re going to put their next-biggest band and then their next-biggest band. You’ve just got to accept that’s the way it is in some situations, and it just depends on the size of the band. With a band like Maxïmo Park, we’ve had to really… it’s been a whole new ball game for me that I just didn’t experience before, where I’m like taking out heads of radio stations and wining and dining them, just really long set-ups of albums, like six months before, so people can see you’ve got a real… because everybody wants to be associated with success, so if they think for a minute that you’re not going to be successful, they’re not just going to back you. You really have to, with a band like that that you think has got a bigger potential start lining up all these… what do you call it? Just letting them know that there’s a plot coming. Basically that it’s a long-term plot and you’re really investing in the artist as a label. Obviously, if somebody from Universal does that they just know that they’re definitely going to put that money in. When a little indie like us sort of crawls in through Radio 1 we gave to convince them by results for them to take the actions that we want them to take. They said to us, “Yeah we will play Maximo on the radio but you’ve got to give us a top 20 record first.” We have to build that up through the live audience and literally just get email addresses from every single gig they’ve played. Built it up until we got about 10,000 on the list and then started selling seven-inches to those people and actually starting to get chart records so then we could go in a few months later and go, “Well, here you go, that’s our end of the bargain. You’re going to stick to it?” There are all those games that got to be played and we can either choose to play them in that sort of game or just not play them and I think that depends on the type of artist. A pop artist like Maximo Park, we’ve got to play those games because we’ve got to be on the radio to sell that amount of records but a band like Battles… completely the other way, they just put out 12”s and then they’ve just gone around the world and toured. First they played to 50 people. Then second time around, they’re playing to 200 and now they’re playing to like 1,500-2,000 people and hopefully that’ll continue, so it’s just really finding where each individual act can pitch itself, and then just seeing if you can get the breaks that you need to get. I think everybody thinks there’s this magic break that’ll get an artist away, but it’s not, it’s just tiny little steps over and over again, whether it’s the way you’re communicating what the artist is about in every single conversation with great enthusiasm, and just being able to look people in the eye and say you’re really behind this. Every little detail that you present in your art work, your photographs. Every mix, every conversation you have, every interview that you do and after a year or two years, this starts getting the momentum going, and I think that’s really what you’ve got to do as an artist. Take responsibility for getting that momentum going and taking the control into your own hands, rather than thinking it’s this big daddy with the checkbook that’s going to make your career. It’s not going to happen. audience member I was just thinking, we managed to do it in New Zealand because it’s only small but, like in the UK… are you working with distribution who have the same ethos or do you distribute yourself… Steve Beckett No, we work with independent distributors, yeah, but you know in the UK, independent distributors are distributing Arctic Monkeys, selling two million records, Franz Ferdinand, Chemical Brothers, all these guys, so the independent scene in the UK is like 25% of the market. If you’re all together as a unit, which we do through these organizations called AIM, we can go to these different bodies and those 25%, which is as big as Sony, or whatever, and have a bit of power. Audience member That’s incredible. Great, cheers. audience member Hi. In the beginning you talked about how business was, I don’t want to say booming, but definitely everything was fine with respect to say, how some of the majors are saying, “The business is down. We’re not getting this, we’re not getting that.” And you mention also setting up these proper deals with your artists with a lot of back end, with royalties split. In a situation where you hear a lot of, even independent labels who say, “Aw, man. You know what, I’m not going to do vinyl any more. I’m not going to do this, it’s pointless.” And obviously with more and more digital sales and that happening… but also with digital, you start to have a situation where I feel people are just kind of picking songs left and right and grabbing what they want, which is, again, fine. How do you see the future of the business say, for a recent signing, where the old model is like, “OK, we have royalties and we split them down the road.” But do you see possibly with the advent of digital and how that’s going, is there possibly going to be less back-end royalties coming down and are the new signings, say, Flying Lotus, going to have the opportunity to reap the benefits like Aphex Twin did and how is that looking for the whole business as a label and with the situation that you have with some of your newer signings? Steve Beckett Artists will still definitely get royalties, but I don’t think they’re going to get their royalties from selling a physical CD. CDs are just dropping through the floor and I see that curve continuing over the next five years. Downloads at the moment are going up, but they’re not going up at the same rate that CDs are going down, but eventually downloads are just going to come down, I think, and music to the “consumer”, in inverted commas, will just be perceived as free. It’s partly the fault of the record industry and partly the fault of technology, that basically, music’s just being perceived by the consumer as less and less valuable. You just don’t know what the price should be. One minute they’re getting a newspaper with a free Prince CD on the cover, the next minute their friend’s giving them 10,000 tunes from their iTunes catalog, so the sort of perceived sense of value of it from the consumer is going down and down and down so. I think in five, certainly ten years, consumers aren’t even going to have a notion of paying for music in the same sense that you don’t have a notion of paying for a TV show when you turn on the TV set, but people still are making money from that and the people who are creating that content are still making money from that, and I think that’s going to be the new model. It’s going to be a combination of artists earning money from sync income, which already a lot of our artists probably earn more from sync than they do from record royalties, so they might get crazy amounts, £300,000 for a Jaguar advert or something like this. They can earn more out of one advert sync than they could make out of five album releases. I think they’re going to be earning money in that way and I think also they’re going to be earning money in… there’s going to be more and more creative partnerships with brands. Music is seen as like they key thing that sells products and makes the association with that product cool. These guys doing this [points to RBMA logo], they’re not doing it out of the pureness of their love for everybody. They want that association with cool up-and-coming artists because they feel it adds to their brand value. The key for us, as people working with artists, is how can we make sure that those things that, in the past, were just seen as promotional or being cool for the artist, that’s not going to be like that any more. It’s going to be like, “How is this brand value addition that this artist’s music that he’s worked his ass off for the last year, that’s putting the association on your brand, how is he going to get paid for that? How is it going to be defined?” These are all the new conversations that are going on with people like MySpace and YouTube, and these guys who’ve got billions and billions of pounds, but nobody goes to YouTube or MySpace just to have a nice time. Most of it is from original content that people like yourselves have worked hard and put up there, and then other people want to hear and enjoy. I think that’s the future, to me, of artist careers and that’s where we’re moving ourselves in the future. We’re just sort of seeing ourselves almost like an a la carte service for the artist, so if we organize a tour, we’ll get paid X percentage for that, if we organize sync activity, we’ll get a percentage for that. The artist could do it itself but do they really want to be spending ten hours a day going to see Saatchi & Saatchi or Jaguar or others? We make these sort of relationships with the artists and almost be an interface between people that are monetizing music out in the world, and it is a sort of new frontier, but I can totally see there’s a future for artists, but I’m absolutely certain it’s not going to be through selling individual tracks or albums. That whole model is over. audience member To close this conversation out, with the recent signings or even your back catalog, you are pitching these songs as quote-unquote “jingles” to some of these advertising firms in maybe like monthly meetings, I suppose? Steve Beckett Oh yeah, like anything, you just get a network of people around the world who are working with the ad agencies and obviously they’re making adverts all the time. Then, for whatever advert they’re making… there are independent people who you can track down, even if you haven’t got a deal, can actually… and they’re quite excited about this, about having music that’s not necessarily signed to a label as long as it fits the pitch that they’re making for the advert, so there’ll be pitches coming around all the time and it’s usually like, “Uplifting, fast, yet mellow with…” just a complete load of contradictions and you go “Yeah, Squarepusher,” and try and get your song on there and you just have to move really quickly and get all the clearances sorted out really quickly, and if it gets to the point where you’ve got your song at the edit stage, you know you’re really in there with the running. It’s just making sure that you’re totally in the loop with all these ads that are being made and just making sure your music’s in there. I think that’s just the first stage of it. The next stage is going to be really exciting in the interest of creative partnerships with these huge brands who no longer just want to put their banner behind the stage or stick it on your CD. They actually want to create new projects and productions and things that have got more substance to them, and I think that really is where there’s going to be a lot of growth for artists. audience member Hi… I’m here. First of all, I want to commend you for maintaining your indie concept through all these years. Most people would probably just kind of sell out and just really go for the money. Steve Beckett Thank you. audience member Kudos to you. First, what was your main inspiration to start the label and what was it in your background, whether it’s business or musical, that made you so successful? Steve Beckett Well, my background was, well, both really. I was trained as a mining engineer (laughs). audience member A mining engineer… so no business background at all? Steve Beckett No, no business background, no. audience member Musical background? Steve Beckett Musically, it was the classic thing. I was in bands myself, in punk bands and trying to make a career that way and then started realizing I was actually better at doing the organizing side of things than making the actual music. Then that led into setting up the record shop and then that’s when the whole acid house scene was taking off, and it was just too much of a vibrant scene not to get involved with. There wasn’t any grand vision for the label at that time it was very much like, “Let’s see if we can sell these 500 records, and take them around the country and see if we can get rid of them.” And once we’d done that it just started leading to more and more things. Audience member Nice, and you had a partner right away or was it just yourself at that time? Steve Beckett No, I had a partner at that time as well, who was a partner in the shop as well. audience member OK, and he’s still there to this day? Steve Beckett No, I don’t know if you were here before, he died of cancer in 2001. audience member Oh, wow. Sorry. Steve Beckett No, it’s OK. audience member That’s it. Thank you. audience member Hi, I’m just curious about Maxïmo Park, because I know a few people were quite surprised when you signed them and obviously you’ve diversified the label over the past 17 years, so what made you decide to sign them? Steve Beckett It was exactly the same sort of thing that made me want to sign any of the other acts. I’d just heard some of the demos and there was just something in the music that I found really authentic and I love their lyrics and the energy that was in the music. But at the same time I realized – you know, I’m not stupid – I realized that it would be a real leap for the label and there’s always the argument, “Should you set up a sub-label and do it under a different pseudonym?” But I just don’t like the idea of that. I like the idea of really standing by the decisions that you’re making so I just thought, “Sod it, we’re going to put them out on Warp.” And at the same time, it was like a real step up for us as a company because we were just playing a completely different ball game that we just didn’t even know existed, where we’re competing against Universal and Phonogram and Sony and all these guys that we just didn’t realize the league of backpacking that’s going on, getting the decisions for the gatekeepers i.e. radio and TV, to support these acts. We just haven’t played in that league before. If you look at the chart in the UK, it’s literally just Universal, Universal ... it’s just crazy. There’d be one little indie in the middle of it, like Domino or Warp, or whatever. It was just us playing in a different league really. I quite enjoyed playing it, but I don’t really want to play there a lot of the time. audience member Cool. OK, thanks. audience member I just got another question. Just going on from what Henry was saying about downloads and that it in music, do you think the extreme access that individuals have these days to whatever music ... any music, do you think that’s increasing listener interest, like more of the public is getting interested in music? Steve Beckett That’s what I feel. There’s pros and cons like anything. It feels like people are listening to more music than they’ve ever listened to before. Listening to it in a different way. Very much like track by track, like you were saying. When I was young, people just used to get an album. They put a needle on a record and play from start to finish and that was it. Whereas now, it just feels like you’ve got track after track of different acts. That’s great because people are soaking up loads of different types of music. Obviously with MySpace, there’s two million bands on there, there’s incredible access to unsigned music which has got a real positive side. I think on the negative side, there might be a lack of subtlety to the music, at least getting through. It’s almost like you’ve got a little radio station going on shuffle in your pocket and the stuff that’s instant, gets attention, and the stuff that’s maybe got a bit more subtlety might not get as much attention. It might work the other way, it might cos you’re on headphones you get deeper into it. I don’t really know yet. audience member Are there more people going to shows, do you think because of this… Steve Beckett The live side is crazier than it’s ever been. It summed it all with Maxïmo Park, when we were pre-selling a download, we pre-sold something like 800 downloads in a week, which is pretty good for a single. At the same time they were selling the tickets for the tour. They sold 20,000 tickets at £20, in less than an hour. You can see where people’s money is going. In a way, they know they can get the music for free but the real unique experience that they know is going to have a limited supply in it, is that fix venue with a 1,000 capacity or whatever. They know that’s the thing they really want to purchase, so they can have a direct emotional experience with the artist. audience member What about DJ culture and the world compared to the live bands? Is that going down do you think or up, like in terms of people attending DJ shows? Steve Beckett To me, I don’t know if this is international, it feels like it’s lower than it used to be at the moment. There’s still the sort of superstar DJs that can actually sell tickets and are commanding those sort of fees. I would say generally, it feels like it’s not as quite as much demand as there used to be. Again, it’s down to you to take that into your own hands and make sure the people that are in that audience or that venue are having a fucking amazing experience. If you’re just coming along, given the experience that they’ve seen 500 times in the last few years, why would they get excited about it? It’s up to you to bring a new experience to them. Also, just show your general enthusiasm about what you’re doing to the audience. Benji was saying before, he’s just sick of seeing people sitting there on stage looking like they’re checking their emails and not really having a connection with the audience. That’s the danger of working with computers, it’s very heady, it pulls you into the screen. The DJ used to be standing there with his heart open, just connecting to the whole fucking audience. That’s sort of what people need to see from people that are presenting something. They want to see a genuine connection to the people that they’ve come to see. Otherwise, they just go home and listen to iTunes on shuffle. audience member One more question. Has there been times in your career where you’ve thought, this is too much? I’ve had enough of this, throw the whole label in, I can’t do this any more? You know what I mean? Steve Beckett Usually, if Aphex Twin blows out a world tour five minutes before he’s supposed to set off, because he wants to go on a picnic with his girlfriend. Things like that can throw you. Obviously, when my partner died that was a huge blow, where I asked a lot of questions about where I was going, why I was doing what I was doing and definitely went through a rocky period where I thought, “What’s the point?” I’ve come out the other end. audience member Alright, thank you. audience member Hello, now that you’re talking about this live versus record selling, acts like Boards of Canada, Autechre and some other people that are signed to your label, they don’t play quite often. Are you going to push them to play? These acts have been out there for a long time, maybe it’s not important, it’s just an example, but the new acts, are you going to push them even more to play more live? Give more live shows and… Steve Beckett As long as they’ve got something to say, I always encourage the acts to play live shows. Autechre that’s a myth, they play all over the world. They just play all the time when they’ve got a record out. Boards of Canada have done about five gigs. I get offers every day for them to play, like crazy offers and regularly go up to Scotland and beg them to go on tour, but they just won’t do it. audience member These bands play in the northern countries, I’d say, I haven’t got the chance to see them very often. It’s like !!! and all these live bands are pretty cool. I suppose they’re going to play around the world. This more experimental and more mind-oriented music I would say, well physical as well, might not hear about them very much. Don’t have this experience, yet. Might take them a little further around the world. Audience member What advice do you have for somebody who wants to start a label today? Steve Beckett The flippant answer will be don’t. It just depends what you’re wanting to achieve. If you want great riches and gold plated taps, I wouldn’t suggest starting one at the moment. If you’re really moved to work with some artists and put some music out into the world, then I would do it. Just depending on what sort of music it is. If it’s just a single release, I’d just put it out on maybe digital only, if you can afford it put it out on 12”. I think the key thing is just making sure you’ve genuinely got great music, not just great music that you think is good, but you’ve checked out with your most hardcore friends who aren’t afraid to give you honest feedback. If they’re saying this is great music, then release it. I think, even if it’s just one 12” or one album, you’ve still got to do the business side and really work out what your figures are and just be really tight on what you’re spending, and really watch how you’re spending on the art work and the manufacture, and every aspect of what you’re doing. If it just swings by a few $100 or definitely a few $1,000 at that level you’re going to have problems. I think it’s just being really sensible and watching what you’re doing financially about what you’re releasing. If you feel moved to do it, definitely do it. audience member You seem pretty involved with all of your groups. Do you have other A&R people working under you or are you usually pretty hands on and go to the sessions and kind of nurture the artist personally? Steve Beckett I’m the main A&R person there, but it’s a very musical company, so even if they’re doing the accounts, they’ll be going out to gigs and bringing in CDs. A lot of the guys are in bands, so it’s very… music’s in the sort of heart and the blood of the company. It’s not like people have got specific A&R jobs, but they’re constantly bringing in new music. Especially the guys that work at Bleep and Warp Mart, which is the digital and physical distribution. Obviously, they’re getting new music coming through there all the time. In terms of sessions, again it just totally depends on what the artist is. Some artists might want real hands-on comment on the bassline of every single track they’re doing and every different mix. Other artists like Aphex Twin, you’ll just get a CD mysteriously land on your desk and it’s like this is the album and don’t dare comment or want changes. I tried to get a radio edit of “Windowlicker” once, it was seven minutes long, and he started describing it like I was trying to cut his baby’s arm off, you know? It just depends on the artist, really. audience member I’ve met so many A&R people in my career, it’s like they just seem very clueless. Every last one of them. I’ve probably met one or two that I’ve actually really liked and seemed to have a real true personal relationship with the artist. Steve Beckett I think a lot of the A&R guys haven’t really got the vocabulary to be able to go into a studio and start commenting… they can say things like, “It needs to be more hyper, it needs to be…” just really general terms. When you’re in the studio, in the sort of the nitty gritty of creation really… when people are creating they’re using very specific language because you’re talking about a subjective thing. So, artists and producers have developed very specific language where they can try and communicate this subjective subject to get the end result of what they want. My experience is a lot of A&R guys and even myself going into a studio, you might think that you can contribute something but I think you can just throw sessions off track and get people in their heads. They might’ve already explored 20 avenues that you’re suggesting one of and decided… I don’t really see it adds a lot. My vision as A&R is more like, I find the people that I trust and I know have got a creative vision. They create what they’re going to create. I then decide which of those creations I’m going to release. If they’ve got something that they want to release, that I don’t believe, I’ll still probably release it anyway. But then, my job is once we’ve got that, how can I through language, art work, all those sort of very subtle messages that everybody unconsciously understands, how can I get that through the eye of the needle, so that people are going to notice my band, instead of all these hundreds on Universal or whatever? I think I see that as more of my role, which is just finding truly creative people. I find those through having a quite deep, authentic conversation with them, by the end of that conversation, I know whether they’re people I want to work with or not. audience member Wow, that’s excellent. Mark Pritchard The other thing I think of ... Steve Beckett I’m going to ask you a question after this. Mark Pritchard The other thing I think of when I think of Warp is the art work. I think it’s been really strong all the way through. Who the people you’ve worked with art work-wise, and how do you see that going with the new digital age of downloads? What’s going to happen to that? Steve Beckett That’s a really good question. Obviously, when we start off with these beautiful 12” sleeves for albums, the classic thing if you like. You’d listen to the album, you’d sit there skinning up or drinking your Red Bull, of course, on this beautiful sleeve, you could really soak in what the music is about. But, as it’s going to more and more downloads, you just see this tiny little JPEG that just really doesn’t get anything over. I think there’s going to be a huge change in design in that way. It’s almost going to become icons, where any subtlety or depth in the art work isn’t going to be relevant really, or you need to do some associated art work or interactive artwork that gets that over, because you’re not going to get that over from the JPEG. I think all that aspect of what you do, it’s just so important. You get some artists, “I don’t care about what the art work is.” It’s all sending messages to the audience and it’s representing you as an artist. I think it’s just so important to get every single sentence of a press release or bio or every photograph, every piece of art work just really truly representing who you are. There’s just so much noise out there, that people are bombarded with all these different images. The one thing that people are really starved of is attention. If you can get people’s attention, that’s a really key thing that you need to go deeper with people rather than wider… not throw loads of imagery and loads of messages out and loads out of money, but just go as deep as you can, so they hit something on a deeper level with people, so they can really get that direct connection with the artists. That’s what I feel, anyway. Mark Pritchard Who’re the people that you use? I think you started off with Designer’s Republic. Steve Beckett Designers Republic because they were in based in Sheffield at the time. We were just really lucky that… you’re sort of writing on your lists of things you got to do. It’s like, “Art work? Who does that?” Then, you ask around. “These guys called Designers Republic in Sheffield.” So, we go down to meet and meet them and everything. We didn’t know at the time that they were some of the best designers on the planet. They’ve really like added a lot to and started giving us a really strong look with all of the releases. We were just really fortunate in that case to get involved with them. It’s the same thing now, just look for any great photographers, directors, or art work people that I can… I’m just constantly looking at magazines, websites, or whatever, just seeing if that’s sticking out, that we can work with that can contribute to what we do. And the question I was going to ask you is, if you can sign a contract four years ago for a Reload album, where is it? Mark Pritchard I gave you another album instead. It’s coming, next year. Steve Beckett He’s been saying that for four years. Mark Pritchard I’m in the birthing process. Steve Beckett Is that it? audience member Sorry guys. I know everyone’s hungry, I’m sorry. Just quickly, you’d mentioned, looking at the charts, No 1 through 10, No 1 through 15, whatever it was, it was Universal. Maybe another major. Do you think that some of these mergers that have been happening, obviously we’re down to three or four majors now, whatever it is… do you think to an extent that gives a bit more of a spotlight to some of the greater indies, more of the powerful indies, making a bit of noise – or has it just been exclusively the selection of the music? Steve Beckett Sorry, what’s the question about? audience member Well, essentially, do you feel that some of these mergers that are taking place, with them just kind of controlling a lot of the music coming… to an extent, do you think that some people are starting to look in other directions and suddenly finding and discovering some of these indies that are sort of making some noise left and right? Steve Beckett I think they’re definitely discovering some of the music. The problem for us is when you get these mergers, it really isn’t about the artists or signing – it’s much more about they get much more tighter control of the gatekeepers, so they can buy out front-of-store racking for the whole year, because they know they’re going to have so many releases. It means we can never get our records front of store because it’s all been booked up by Universal. Your records just naturally sell more if they’re front of store from a more casual purchaser than people going into the A to Z, that sort of thing. There’s all those day-to-day fights that you got with a major… same thing with the radio. If radio knows that 80% of its playlist is going to be coming from Universal and Universal know that they can have all of those records played on Radio 1, they can be flying these guys everywhere, putting them up in amazing hotels, all that sorts of things. It’s just that they get tighter and tighter control of those gatekeepers. Which obviously from their perspective, is a great thing, because they get their artists through the doors. Then, they get a new set of problems, because they just have so many artists, it’s only the big artists that get the attention. The little ones come through, get their records out, and nothing gets tended to. With an indie, every single record – from something that’s going to sell 10,000 to something that’s going to sell half a million – gets genuine attention and we try to pitch it to the audience that it should be getting pitched to. So that we’ve got artists that might be selling 10,000 records who were making a living out of it through different associated income streams. It’s like anything. It’s got pros and cons, but I think anything where you get one player getting a bigger and bigger share of the market can just get really dangerous. They just become so powerful and they don’t want other people to get into their… as they see it, their area. audience member Really, the last question. You mentioned the referral process about other artists pointing out certain independent artists doing their thing and you getting to hear them out. On a business or musical level, is there another label out there you feel that… or that you have respect for that you may want to mention to us at all, musically or on a business model side? Steve Beckett I think there’s a few ... I think Beggars Banquet to me is a label that I’ve really looked up to. They’ve got sub labels like XL, I think Domino obviously have come through in the last few years with all rock stuff. I know those guys. I know they’re really straight and do everything they can, making sure the business side is straight and that they’ve got great relationships with their artists. Ninja Tune, who we’re great friends with, I think they’ve got good relationships with a lot of people they work with. I think the bigger indies are still really worth talking to and seeking out. Is that it? audience member Yeah, that’s it. Steve Beckett Let’s eat. Benji B Much respect to Warp Recordings. Steve Beckett Thanks so much. That was really good, I really enjoyed it. Benji B Many thanks indeed. Steve Beckett. Make some noise. [Applause]

Steve Spacek
The man behind the project of the same name, Steve Spacek grew up in the churches and raves of South London. In this talk at the 2005 RBMA in Seattle, he details the many different influences that went into the pioneering sound of his band, talking at length about the creative process. To him, the music and the vibe are more important than the song, with the voice being little more than another instrument. We also hear about the importance of having the right bass and the right face, digging for beats and why the endorsement of other big name stars can be crucial to an underground artist.
Hosted by Benji B There’s not many better ways to introduce our guest today. So make him feel very welcome, Mr Steve Spacek. [applause] How’re you doing, man? Steve Spacek Good, recovered. Benji B Steve’s just come especially to be here from Sydney, Australia. Steve Spacek A long way. Benji B Jetlag alright? Steve Spacek A bit in between. I’m a bit up there, a bit on the ground. Got to work it out
still, but it’s a good place to be in. Benji B We heard music there from Spacek’s first album, Curvatia. And we’re going
to touch on everything that you’ve done, but I think we should start with your musical
background just to fill people in on where you’re from. Steve Spacek I’m from South-East London, born and bred, grew up there. As you can imagine
it’s quite a big West Indian community, a lot of Jamaicans, Barbadians, people
from the Caribbean, a lot of Asians. When I say Asian, in the UK Asian means
Indian people, Pakistan, India, Bengali. A mix of all types of people. I grew up with a
big soundsystem vibe, plenty of soundsystems around. But there’s a flipside,
which was going to church from quite a young age. They had a band playing in
the church so that had quite a big influence as well. Just developed from
there, all the way through the '70s. I suppose, we’re going to touch on all
the little places as we go along. Benji B So gospel and the church was definitely a big part of the upbringing? Steve Spacek Yeah, definitely. I just remember, Sunday with my mum and my sister, Maria, I
would’ve been like four or five years old, we’d be in the church and there’d
be this church band, basic drum, bass player, guitar and there was this dude
with the crash cymbal, crashing away trying to lift everyone up. That
definitely had a play on me. The dude with the guitar was called Brother
Gordon, and it was an electric-acoustic, must have been one of the early ones,
a plug-in acoustic, and a Vox amplifier. That always used to play on my mind;
for whatever reason I liked the look of that. I think that helped to start
things off. That’s one of my earliest memories, the Vox amp and that acoustic
guitar, Brother Gordon just strumming away. Some basic chords, because for the
hymns and gospel songs, the chord structures are quite basic. They don’t
really stray too far. That’s my earliest memory. Benji B What were you going out and hearing at this point? What was influencing you to start
making soundsystem music? Steve Spacek I’ll tell you what, apart from the whole soundsystem vibe that was going out
in the summer, but in those days it was the rave music; the whole Detroit
sound coming over and that was big in London, it was massive. The whole rave
thing took off, there were big clubs like Clink Street and Shoom and another
one that really blew up was Spectrum, which was in this club called Heaven
underneath Charing Cross station. Then it spread out and went into the raves
like Biology and Sunrise. But that was it at that time, that was all the acid
house stuff and the early house coming over from Detroit. And also Chicago,
Farley "Jackmaster" Funk and all those guys. It was just a mad sound, and you
can imagine being in the UK, all that stuff is passing through and we had all
this equipment that, when you turn it on, it’s making all the same frequencies, so everything is making sense. Benji B I remember when I got hold of "Eve," it was a long time before your album came
out, but I think that was the song that brought most people into contact with
Spacek, the group. You might say it had been done before, but it was one of
the freshest things to have been heard for years. We should probably hear it,
actually, because it still sounds good now. (music: Spacek – "Eve" / applause) Benji B How many years ago did that record come out now, or rather how long since you
first started putting it out there? It must have been a long time. Steve Spacek It was ’97 when we did it. Benji B At the time, sonically it sounded so fresh, apart from the fact your voice
sounded unique, a new sound in itself, what you were doing with the music was
definitely new. Where were you trying to go with that? Steve Spacek Before that point we were doing a lot of live stuff like "I Have A Daughter
That Sings," and some of those tracks were quite old, from the early '90s.
Then Morgan got an MPC and so we got into some hip-hop vibes, messing around
with stuff. Then one day he came in with this beat and I said "OK!" It was
just right where we needed to be at that time and if you know Morgan, he’s on
some mad shit. So we were messing around on the MPC and all of a sudden we had
this shape. And the way he chopped the sample, the singer was saying,
"Believe, 'cause I need you," but he chopped it off so he said, "Eve." I like
when I hear something, and I’m like, "OK, this is interesting." So I thought
I’d write a song about Eve and how much I need you, a love song, and then the
writing extended from there and it was a whole natural process. Benji B Tell me about the songwriting process because the songs you write are special.
Often that’s an imaginary song, "If I Need You," "I Have A Daughter That
Sings" – you didn’t have a daughter at the time. Steve Spacek So many people ask me that. Benji B So where do you get the inspiration for these things? Steve Spacek Sometimes I’ll get inspired by a sample or I might be messing about with a
keyboard. Sometimes I’m out in a club and something banging is playing, but as
I’m listening to it, in my mind I can hear what I would sing over it. So I
have this little vibe and then the next day I’ll wake up and think, "I’ve got
to make a tune out of that." In terms of writing, I approach it from all
angles. I try to be open as much as possible. I want to be in a situation
where the moment I hear something I can get something down as soon as
possible. Those are the moments, the natural moment, when something hits you,
trying to capture those moments. Back in the day I used to be self-conscious
because people are quite critical. When you make music, you’re putting
yourself out there and everyone sees something in what you’re doing. So it’s
quite hard, but at the end of the day you’ve just got to say, "This is what
I’m feeling and I don’t care if it sounds corny, as long as people see that
it’s genuine." The one thing I try and stay away from – you can argue that with
"Dollar" – is the politics. I want to write about, say, the corner of that
chair, just for music’s sake. I was talking to my boy the other day, and I
said, "Sometimes it jars me when people talk about songs. Because they say
it’s all about the song, but I don’t believe that, to me it’s all about the
music." When you hear something, are you in or not? When someone sings, are
you in or not? If there’s an orchestra playing, are you feeling it? You hear
those notes and you’re feeling it or you’re not. Benji B So in that respect, the voice is another instrument to you? Steve Spacek Exactly, I want it to be part of the whole picture. In the early days I didn’t
want there to be too much focus on myself, I wanted it to be on the band. But
that’s quite hard because you go places and they take your picture and they’re
trying to put you in the middle, they want to put you forward. You’ve got this
thing about the band, but as soon as you start singing, then obviously you’ve
got this thing about being the frontman. My stage name being Steve Spacek and
the band being named after that, it’s this whole thing. But for me, when I
write, it’s about the whole picture, the music, I’m not trying to put across
this message. But sometimes I’ll look back and realize it’s about things I’m
going through with family or friends, and sometimes it’s just nonsense; but if
I feel that, I want to put that down and create a vibe and if people are
feeling that, they can get into it. Or they might not. You can’t please all
the people all the time, but you’ve got to be true to yourself. I try to stay
away from trying to preach and create some deep meaning because that’s not
what it’s about for me. I’m just trying to create music and when I write I
just want to feel it. I’m writing these lyrics, but really, when I write I
just want to do it in a way that means I can feel pleasure, so I can feel that
when I’m singing it. So even if I’m singing nonsense, I just want to feel the
vibe of my voice within that whole setting. It’s as important to me as a
bassline, as a drum kick, as a synth sound in the background or the spaces in
between. It’s all one. Benji B I was having the D’Angelo’s Voodoo argument the other day with someone who
will remain nameless. I’m just bringing that up as an example of something
that people had a problem with because they said, "Where are the songs?"
That’s a good example of a record where you’re listening to it more like the
voice is an instrument or another layer. Steve Spacek Totally, when I listen to him I hear his voice and I like his writing but I
get so much pleasure out of listening to the way he sings. He’s going to some
crazy places and he’s feeling his soul music so deeply that it doesn’t matter
what he’s trying to say. It’s just, "Sing man, sing anything, sing whatever
comes out." Benji B But it must jar with you if someone is singing rubbish. Your songs do have
substance and they do have themes even if parts of it are imaginary. Steve Spacek Sure, but sometimes I sing rubbish too. Benji B How do you find a balance between the two? Steve Spacek The balance is a whole package, so when you listen you hear the whole sound.
That is a balance and I don’t know at what point I feel that it’s right, or
when Morgan or Edmund feel that it’s right. Normally, we’ll be sitting in the
studio and we’ve got this loop that is going 'round and 'round. Sometimes,
like back in the day, we’d be in the studio with a fat J and it would be going
'round and 'round for days without us arranging. Maybe I’ll just sing a little
line, just to get some voice on there and we’ll just be vibing on that.
Sometimes it’ll be like, "You know what? Maybe we should put this out like it
is so people can feel that." Maybe it’ll be that the bassline is nice and hot
and the snares are cracking through and the pads are just taking you away. Benji B A more recent example of that is probably "3Hrs of Fun." Steve Spacek Yeah, certainly is. You want me to bust it on here? Benji B This isn’t really a song, it’s just a vibe. Steve Spacek It’s inspired by being in Plastic People. (music: Steve Spacek - "3Hrs Of Fun" / applause) Steve Spacek As you can imagine when we put this groove together we were just letting it go 'round
and 'round. Benji B So going back to the first album, Curvatia, even though it was
quite minimal and you say you were just listening to grooves and stuff, it’s
got this epic feeling to it, really uplifting feel. There’s so many different
textures. How did you achieve that, what sort of equipment were you using at
the time? Steve Spacek Well, essentially it was MPC and Logic. By that time we’d switched over to
using Logic. The whole situation with Jason Knight, our original manager, and
Morgan, we had this whole unit called Head On Management and we had this
studio, which we used to share with this whole group of artists. At the time I
was still using Cubase and I remember going in the studio and seeing Logic and
it was one of the earliest Logics, Logic 1 or whatever. My boy Jeff Mann, who
recorded all our stuff with us, we used to have these little things at each
other, saying, "That’s just copying Cubase." Logic was Notator back in the day
and it switched over, correct me if I’m wrong. But I began using Logic and
that was it; hook, line and sinker, I was in. So we had the MPC and we had the
Logic and we just combined the two. Benji B I remember going to see you live and being put in the picture because a lot of
the things that I thought were sound effects or samples were actually Ed
playing guitar. It’s not often when you see a three-piece [performance] that
you see a producer, a vocalist and a guitar player, rather than a producer who
plays MPC and keys, and there’ll be a percussion player or whatever. How
instrumental was the guitar work in the album? Steve Spacek Well, it’s quite a lot. Eddie is an amazing guy, if you can get him down here
some time he’s a man to have around. Musically, he’s in some deep places. I
say he’s ill, he’s not ill. He’s got this illness that he catches every now
and again, he’s a manic depressive. But I’ve learned so much off him and he
tries to go all these different places. Because we’re trying to create this
space, he’ll create all these lines and stuff, but it’s too much to put it all
in one track. We’ll let Eddie play and we’ll lay down tracks and tracks. What
he brings to the table is really important because in certain tracks I’ll say,
"I can really feel Eddie’s vibe in that, it’ll really fill that space." He’s
got quite a full-on vibe, and then me and Morgan will try to pull things back,
create a music where it’s the only thing that’s there is what should be there
- and no excess. That’s our thing. We sit there and we’re vibing in the studio
but eventually you’ve just got to say, "This is over." It’s quite hard
sometimes because you’ve got your creations and you want to keep tweaking and
keep going. Benji B And the bass frequency is pretty important to you. Steve Spacek Oh yeah, has to be. Growing up with reggae and coming from a Jamaican
background, the bassline is something that excites us. You know how it is,
coming from London you go into a club and you hear the bassline and you can
hear your ribcage vibrating. Go and hear Jah Shaka, which is a
dubplate soundsystem, go and check that out and you know about immense power.
It’s like a volcano in a dance. People are fainting. That has a big play on
it. Also a lot of the dance music and the way it develops in the UK, it went
onto jungle and stuff that was reggae-led, and the bassline always played a
big part. We always try to make sure there was a line going through there.
It’s like walking around and taking you somewhere, not just sitting there
going 'boom, boom, boom' - which is cool, but I want the bassline to talk. Benji B This album came out on Island. Tell me about the distance between forming a
group, finding your identity, going on a journey musically and then signing to
major record label. What’s the experience like? Steve Spacek It’s quite blurry but I’ll try and work it out. First it was "Eve" and that
whole experience there. Then thinking, "We’ve got to go down this road with an
album," because this is quite a serious sound and we were getting good
feedback and we really wanted to develop it. It was strange because we came
with the "Eve" track and a lot of people were expecting an album straight
away, but we hadn’t even made the album Curvatia. There was a few tracks
that had been written, and "I Have A Daughter That Sings," which had been
recorded in a different situation. So like a year, a year-and-a-half went by
just putting some stuff together and meantime being courted by all these
labels, one of which was Ross Allen’s label, Island Blue. Ross had been given this label at Island Universal and he was really
into what we were doing. At the same time Mos Def had got some of the tracks
we’d been working on, he’d got "Eve" and "Language." Tony had been in the
States and he’d hooked up with this really cool girl called Santi White [Santigold], she was in a band called Stiffed. She was around the crew, Mos Def and A Tribe Called Quest and
all those boys, and she was saying, "You’ve got to hear what these guys from
the UK are doing." So he was interested and he was starting this label on
Universal called Good Tree and that helped us with the whole Island situation
because it was an endorsement. Being in the UK – and it’s probably the same if
you’re in the States – to really jump to another level, you’ve got to get an
endorsement from someone else. If people are checking you out in the States,
then they think it’s cool. Benji B I remember in the '90s some people used to shrink-wrap their records, it made
them look like they were imports from America. I know a lot of bands from
America, from different genres maybe, they break in Europe and then come back.
What does it feel like as an artist knowing that what you’re doing is good but
it takes someone taking an interest, an artist like Mos Def or whoever, to
hype it in America for people in your own country to know what you’re doing? Steve Spacek It’s quite hard, but it’s part of the battle, it makes it more interesting.
Sometimes, if things are too easy, then you don’t really value your worth.
Sometimes you’ve got to work your way around it because that’s just the way it
is. Hopefully other things will come into play, too, that will help the whole
thing. You just play music and you want people to see it for what it is, not
deal with the whole politics and the labels. At that time a few other things
were blowing up in the UK and we were being told our sound was really
leftfield, a weird sound. I thought, "This ain’t no weird sound, there might
be parts of it that are quite new, but it’s just a soul sound and we’re just
interpreting it in our own way." A lot of people around us, a lot of our
peers, chose to go down that more retro route. I’m sitting here with the
laptop and all this equipment and the whole idea of being creative is to come
up with something new and hopefully the industry could do something with it. I
don’t know how to sell music, I just know how to make it and play it and sing.
You want someone to meet you half way, so it’s quite a difficult process when
you’re trying to shop your stuff around. But the good thing was Ross, and the
situation with Mos Def really helped a lot. Ross had this thing on the radio
station, I think it was GLR, and it was worldwide, too, and he was playing all
these different types of music, similar to what
Gilles and Benji are doing, spreading it around. Ross had this thing and he always used to champion us and
when he had this Island Blue situation he said, "You’ve got to come on board."
So that’s how we got into that and it was cool, it helped us a lot. So you’re
talking to these guys about your music and your creativity, but it’s going
over their heads. As I said before, you’ve got the music business and it’s
literally music and business. It’s oil and water, they don’t go together.
They’re somewhere else, one’s down there, the other’s over there [points in
different directions]. You’ve got the figures and they’ve got to add up, and
then there’s you, creating all this stuff, and you want people to understand
what they’re dealing with, to put it out so people can buy it. So it’s quite a
difficult vibe. There was us, Box Saga, Pay As You Go, there was so many
people. Kirk Degiorgio was there, Custom Blue. I think there was about 40 different acts. Benji Blue And a lot of those records didn’t come out. Steve Spacek No, a lot didn’t. Troubleman... Benji B These are artists that are relatively underground. Having been on the majors
and the independents, what was the bonus about that time? Did you get tour
support, good promotion? Was there anything positive about that experience? Steve Spacek Yeah, it was good in terms of us being quite young and being in that environment. I think it’s good to experience all those places, whether it be a major label deal or an independent. It was cool, man, 'cause all of a sudden we’re in a situation where you’re talking about a massive budget. We come from
the road and we’re in big fat studios and everything was available to us –
orchestras, and so on. It was crazy, you could just go mad places. That was
the plus side, but there’s always the other side. You’re dealing with these
companies and they’ve got to sell and if they’re not interested or they don’t
understand, to all intents and purposes it’s not happening. You’re fighting a
losing battle. Benji B Looking back on it, is there anything you’d have done differently? Steve Spacek No, not really. I know now that was part of the journey and it helped to get
me where I am now. I suppose, if we could have done a few more business things
a bit more on it, that would’ve been a good thing. But, like I said before, it
was a learning thing, it was all part of the journey. But no regrets, man, you
can’t have any regrets. At the time we made a great album and I’m really happy
about that because that’s really important. I have to try and put something
across to the best of my ability and it’s the same for all of us, we have to
try and do something the best we can, to give it all. And I feel at that time
we really did. I think the resources available to us, we didn’t really waste
anything. We spent a lot of money, there was a lot of money floating around,
but it was good. If I could look back and say, "I wasn’t too sure about the
album," then I would’ve done the album differently, but I love what we created
back then, I feel it deeply. It’s cool. Benji B Which leads us nicely to the next question. As many people consider that album
a classic in its own way, it’s very dear to a lot of people, what kind of
pressure is there when you’ve got to come up with number two? Steve Spacek Yeah, there’s pressure, but you feel the pressure before you start doing it
and you’ve got to put all that aside. I realize these things keep you humble
and there’s never that pinnacle place. You reach certain levels as you go
along and you’re always trying to go to that nirvana. So I remember periods
when we weren’t doing music and it’s just business meetings and offices and
hanging out and not really creating anything, thinking, "Ah, can I really do
this?" A project’s coming up and you doubt yourself a little bit, and then you
have to think of some of the things you’ve done in the past to remind yourself
of where you’re at. Sometimes it doesn’t feel easy in a way, but when
you’re in it, it does feel easy, when you’re in the studio, you’re like,
"That’s that, that’s that." But in between there’s so many distractions it’s
quite hard to imagine being in that place and getting in that situation. Benji B What is that zone and how do you find your zone? Steve Spacek A lot has changed now being in Australia, but it used to be being in a studio,
locked away day and night for a few days and we're just getting down. No
distractions, no phones, me and the boys, rinsing out all the directions we
want to go. Like, we’ve got a few samples, a few sounds, a few lyrics and we
just try things out and then just get it rolling. Basically, it’s that place
where you’re going, "I can hear this," and then trying to get it down the way
you can in your mind because that’s quite a hard thing. You can hear something
in your mind and when you put it down, it winds up being something else.
Sometimes, if you’re lucky, it’s something better, but sometimes you go to
another place and it’s somewhere you don’t want to be and you have to pull
yourself back and go, "How did I hear this in my mind?" Being in that really
good place is being able to put all that stuff down how you hear it in your
mind. This is how it’s flowing in my mind, this is the space, this is the
swing. This is where the bass is going when I put it down like that, because
it’s pure in my mind and hopefully it will still be pure. Ideally, I’m trying
to create that environment. There’s no distractions, and usually that’s at
night and you just want to go off in these different directions. Benji B This is Steve’s most recent album, which is out on Sound In Colour very
shortly. It features a collaboration with, I believe, a guest lecturer from
term one here, Leon Ware.
How was that? Steve Spacek Leon Ware, the great. It was crazy, he’s so much fun to be around because he’s
just full of music. We met him at Raphael
Saadiq’s studio when we were working on his album and he was coming down and hanging out with all these people. There was a big grand piano in the live room and he’d just
come down and play. He’s easy to hang out with, relaxed. He’s been there, he’s
done it, there’s no angst. It’s just all about creating. It was big fun. The
whole process was easy, too, because we had some beats floating around in
Logic, I left him a few of the beats, let him chill with them, and he wrote.
One night we were hanging out at his place and he said, "I’m feeling something
on this track right now." He loaded it up on ProTools and just started laying
down some harmonies. I was like, "Ahh, excellent. This is a man from way back in the day and he’s laying down some music. I’ve got to rise to this because this is a
challenge. He’s written something, he’s sung down this vibe and I’ve got to
take it away and create my vibe and we've got to do this duet." Benji B How did you meet Leon Ware? Steve Spacek It was through Mathieu Schreyer, Mr French, who’s based in L.A., and he’s
hooked up with all these people and one day he met Leon. I don’t know how or
where, but it was that thing of just hanging out. Benji B And this is a track on your new album. Have you got it for us? Steve Spacek I certainly have. It’s called "Smoke." I don’t know if anyone knows Leon, but
he’s what we in London call a "gallist," he’s into the ladies, so he’s forever
young. This is him talking about meeting this lady called Smoke. (music: Steve Spacek feat. Leon Ware- "Smoke" / applause) Benji B So that’s "Smoke," featuring Leon Ware. And that's on the new album, Space Shift, which is coming out on an LA-based
label. Steve Spacek It’s out already actually, it’s been out for a little while. Benji B Sound In Colour. So, after the Island thing you did another album, one for
!K7, which is a pretty big European label. And after that, did you decide you
wanted to do some solo stuff? How did you come to put out a solo album on an
independent based in America? Steve Spacek That was that whole situation of moving away from London because I was hanging
out in LA quite a lot with Mr French. At the beginning of this year I was
sitting around with some tracks and ideas and these guys were really
interested in doing this album. We hooked up from the GB situation last year,
or I think it was EZP actually, "Simply So." Benji B He’s an artist on Sound In Colour. Steve Spacek Really amazing producer, young cat. We’d already done some stuff there but the
whole idea was to do an album, a Steve Spacek album. For quite a few years,
coming from a background of producing and also writing at the same time,
people were always saying to me, "When are you going to do your own album?" So
all of a sudden I’m sitting in LA and I’ve got all this time. Going
back and forth, sometimes me and Morgan were in LA together, other times I’d
be here on my own, then he’d be out. Everyone’s out doing their thing,
Edmund’s off doing his thing. So I just thought, "Let’s do this album," quite
a natural thing. Then Mathieu, Mr French, being the person he is, is just
hooking up all these situations with these people. Benji B So who’s collaborating and producing on this album? Steve Spacek Well, there’s this young guy called Steve Brunner, amazing instrumentalist,
producer and bass player. He’s about 19, maybe 20 now, but he’s got an old
head on him. He produced a track called "Hey There" and he plays a six-string
bass, but he plays the chords and he put this mad sound, and he puts
the grooves together on the MPC. We’d hung out and listened to stuff, vibing
at Raphael’s studio, and I knew if I was doing something, he was definitely
going to come in. As I was going along the way, I was meeting these people and
they’re playing me their music and I’m thinking, "I can imagine myself singing
over that." If I can hear myself over it, then he’s in. So there’s him and
there was me and Mr French hanging out in the studio together. And the
"Thursdays" track was an idea I got from this guy called John, whose part of
this other label from Ox. And he’s part of this LA vibe, this whole groove,
and so we worked that. Then there’s the Leon Ware track and there’s this jam
we put together called "Callin Yu," which is myself, Mr French, Leon Ware and
Orin 'Afronaught' from the Bugz [In The Attic] all in the studio. Gary Dourdan
from CSI, we’re all in his place, hanging out and we get on this groove, so I
decided to put that on the album too. It was just an idea, a vibe. I wanted
the album to not just be about songs, but about music, I want people to really
feel that. At the same time I want to make sure there’s something on there
that’s quite commercial, too, I want to reach out to a bigger audience. What
else is there? There’s a song called "Look Into My Eyes," which is an old
track recorded between myself and the Spacek guys in a live situation. Let’s
make sure I’m not leaving anybody out. There’s my brother
dBridge, we got down on
"The Hills" and then there’s "Rapid Rate," GB, and not forgetting Jay Dee on
the "Dollar" track. Benji B Now, Jay Dee opened you up to a whole new audience, certainly in the US. A lot
of people know you through this remix of "Eve," so it must have been nice to
link up. Steve Spacek It was overdue, really overdue. A lot of people probably know I’m bang into
his sound. To me, it’s a real soul sound but it’s got that hi-tech feel as
well, touching on Kraftwerk. Then there’s the feel of his music, the swing and
the timing. Things are off but they’re in. I like that because it’s like life.
Life is precise but it’s not precise all at the same time. Everything is made
up of calculation but it’s also chaos, it just goes off, and I hear that in
his music a lot. Benji B And how do you achieve that freeness when you’re working in a computer
environment? Steve Spacek At the end of the day I know I’m working with this instrument and it’s a
precision instrument so you’ve really got to project your soul into it. It’s
about laying ideas and grooves down but not being too precious about them.
Like, when you lay down that first drumkick and the snare together, and you’re
rolling with them, but you don’t really want to tighten it up too much. But at
the same time you’ve got to make sure there are certain elements that are
precise so you lead people along, but you’ve got to make sure other things are
loose and free. Combine that and it creates that effortless place of things
being precise and loose. Like, the snare drum is right in the middle and it’s
bang on, but the kickdrum is all the way back with the bassline. Then the
vocals could be way ahead and together it creates this picture that’s moving
around. It’s like clockwork, but it’s not. Benji B I’ve heard from some people you’ve collaborated with that you’re one of the
very fastest writers around. You’ll go in, catch a vibe, sing it, out, done.
What’s the point where you feel happy to let go and let it be? What’s the
point where you think that it’s done? Are you quite easy about that stuff? Steve Spacek Yeah, I am, but I’m not sure. I don’t want to be sure, I don’t want to think,
"This is it!" Even though I know I want to stop at some point. When I stop
sometimes I’m not sure and in my mind I’m thinking I should’ve dealt with that
a bit differently. But then I leave it because I’ve found in the past that
when I go back and change things something is missing. So I just lay it down,
warts and all, just lay it down raw. When I write it’s the same thing and I’ll
think, "Maybe I should change that lyric there because it doesn't quite fit there." But then I like the way I’m singing it, the way it sounds, so it’s
got to stay. There’s no time to delay, I want to hear myself over the whole
thing, so you don’t want to deliberate too long. Benji B Talking about collaborating, there’s the whole experience of working with
Raphael Saadiq. It’s not every day you get a phone call from Raphael Saadiq
saying, "I want to fly you over to work with me for a month." How did that
happen? Steve Spacek That was fun. That was through Mr French again, hanging out in LA Raphael’s
got this studio down in the Valley and Matt had loads of our beats, stuff that
me and Morgan had been doing and he’d been playing them around. He does this
club on a Sunday, in Santa Monica, with this guy called Garth Trinidad on
KCRW. They play a lot of European stuff, a lot of American stuff, stuff from
all over the place. It’s a nice international vibe. Raphael came down one
night and Matt hooked him up with a CD and he phoned Matt back and said,
"We’ve got to get down on some of this stuff. I’m thinking of doing this album
on a whole other side. I’m going to call it the Pookie Blue Room Number 10."
So he’d make out it was something that had been going on for a while and this
is Number 10 in the series. So he hooked up with him, he flew us over and we
just worked in his studio on these beats. It was nice because he had all these
people passing through. People were feeling our vibe. It was just good to be
in that environment, you’ve got all these idols walking through like George
Clinton, everyone, Q-Tip, Rasheed or Common, Jay Dee. It’s pure inspiration.
You’re sitting there with your laptop and these guys are vibing off your
beats. Benji B So were you producing for him or songwriting for him? Steve Spacek Just producing. A bit of songwriting, but most of the songwriting was for ones
I did myself, so maybe I’d write down a verse or a hook line. Then Rae would
come in on his own and hook the studio up and just chill on the sofa and vibe
on what I’d laid down before and what Morgan laid down. Generally, he’d leave
us to our own devices, he’d be in there doing stuff and every now and then
he’d come in and get down on a track that we’d done. Quite loose. We were just trying to feel our way through it. Benji B And that definitely opened a few doors and opened your eyes as well in terms
of the work ethic in L.A., people’s enthusiasm to collaborate as well, which
isn’t always the way where you’re from. Steve Spacek No, it’s different. What do they call it? The 'tall poppy syndrome.' Where I
come from there’s a lot of talent and a lot of creative people but you can’t
really get too ahead of yourself because people are looking to knock you down.
In a way it’s a shame because when you’re creating you want to be able to go
to a place where that is. And sometimes I’ll see where people make this album
and people will say in the write-up that it’s too self-indulgent. What do you
mean "self-indulgent?" If you’re making music you have to be self-indulgent,
it’s about creating something, it’s about being honest, being you. No matter
how basic or intricate or advanced it is you’ve got to indulge yourself. Look
at someone like Bjork, that’s self-indulgent but that’s what I like about it.
When I listen to her I get great pleasure because I know she’s not holding
back. She’s making the music she wants to make and she’s putting it out there.
You get that kind of vibe, but when you come to L.A., and in the States in
general, people are quite intrigued because to me it’s a soul sound. This is
where the sound comes from originally. It’s quite weird to come here from the
UK and to be making soul music. The feedback you get is quite important and
there’s so much vibe, there’s so much encouragement and enthusiasm. It’s a
strange environment to be in and it’s refreshing. People aren’t looking at you
in a certain way and thinking, "Oh, he’s getting ahead of himself." Benji B With the exception of four or five household names that are soul music exports
from the UK there’s not really an industry in the UK, or Europe in general.
How do you combat that? You’ve had to travel. Steve Spacek Yeah, being here, I guess. That’s not a bad thing because the globe is shrinking and you’ve got to put yourself about. Benji B Talking of which, you’ve relocated again to Australia, which is about as far
away from the UK as you can get. Steve Spacek Yeah, it’s on the other side completely. Benji B And how’s that? Steve Spacek I’m having a great time out there, a great place. I feel like there’s a lot of
space. I realized that when I was in London, those days prior to moving to
LA, it was getting quite intense. I was at a stage where I was like, "If
this carries on much longer, I’m going to have to go and get a day-job." I’ve
seen so many people around me who are amazing talents but at the end of the
day they’ve got to pay the bills, they’ve got to go out and get a day job.
Then the whole creative side gets put by the wayside because you’ve got to
keep paying those bills. I managed to hang in there, but, you know, London is
so expensive. But I was thinking, "I’ve got to keep doing this, I have to keep
making music at all costs, this is what I do." So I had to make that move and
being in LA all of a sudden there’s just all these people who hang out and
make music and it was great, it was keeping things rolling. Benji B There’s people sitting in this room from literally countries all over the
world, different cities, big and small. There’s this idea that it’s really
difficult to get on unless you’re in one of the major cities, a New York or an
LA with its own industry and recording infrastructure. But that’s a bit of a
myth and you’re proving so. How is the feeling of plugging out of that,
because you’ve spent all this time in L.A. and London and suddenly now you’re
in Sydney, which is obviously a big city, too, but in terms of the people
you’re communicating with, they’re on the other side of the world. How has
that affected the way you do your business? Steve Spacek I’m just on a plane a lot more now, and I feel like I’m flying more than I’m
on the ground. It does take a toll on you because I’ve got family, too, and
I’ve got to make sure I’m solid there. It’s hard work, but at the same time
hard work is fulfilling, so it’s not easy. Some people are lucky, they can
literally buy themselves a laptop and bust two tunes
and a man hears it and all of a sudden it’s in the top 10. It happens, it’s
luck. But where I am, I don’t feel it’s about luck, it’s about hard work. The
way things are set up with the Internet you can get where you want to get, but
it is hard work. My mum always used to say, "The road is not for the swift,
it’s for those who want to endure." I can say that’s for me, it’s all about
endurance. I’ve been doing this all my life, but seriously since 1990, and
sometimes I feel like I’ve just begun. I don’t know, when you get to a point
where you feel like you’re a veteran and you’ve been doing this for years. I
feel like I’m still starting. It’s a long road and it’s hard work and it’s
good work. I’m always trying to see it from different angles, the angle that
even though it’s hard work and I have to put down a lot, I feel blessed as
well. I get to fly around and meet all these people, be in these different
places. So it’s balancing out and seeing that it’s a good thing, but at the
same time it’s not easy. But if you’re prepared to put in the time and you’ve
got some talent, then you can go some places. Audience Member Is that a bootleg and how did that come about? You mentioned before Mos Def
had your song and was interested. Why was it never released initially? Steve Spacek Because, as I mentioned before, the whole Island situation fell apart. Things
that we had planned were just out of the way, all these ideas and all these
masters that we had floating around. Mos came to London, I think for some kind
of award. I think maybe the Mobo’s was just starting off, or maybe the Mercury
[Awards], maybe not. He was in the studio, he was just vibing down with us and
we planned on doing another mix of it with him rapping, because obviously he’s
feeling it and it’s like him endorsing it. So he was in the studio on the drum
kit, just hanging out in the studio and he laid it down and we have had it
ever since. That would have been another mix coming out of thw whole "Eve" thing but obviously it fell through. Also Island was changing, but Mos Def was also getting more
into his acting side, so Good Tree, the label he was starting, it never really
got off the ground. He had some other acts, I don’t really know who, but it
didn’t really take off because he got into his acting and that was it. All
that other stuff fell by the wayside. Audience Member Listening to some of your sounds I couldn’t help think of your fellow UK artist Omar. Any plans to get with him for some vocals or production, because as I listen to it I couldn’t help thinking of that link? Steve Spacek There’s no plans but I could bump into him tomorrow and it’s on. I don’t know
him personally, though I’ve met him a couple of times and he’s a heavyweight
cat. But he’s on his own journey, he’s his own cat, but when I look at him my
heart bleeds. Check it out, how can there not be a situation where someone
like him can come through on a proper level? When he came with that "There’s
Nothing Like This" track, straight away that’s a mad talent and I feel he’s
been neglected, and I feel that he’s been let down by the British music scene. Benji B He’s another perfect example of someone who’s appreciated far more here in
America than the UK. Steve Spacek Totally. Every time I come here, this is the only time I hear about Omar,
really. He releases these albums and funnily enough I always bump into him
down at [Notting Hill] Carnival or see him perform. I’m walking along and I
always bump into Omar for some reason, but it’s only when I come out to
America that I hear people give him props. It’s a sad thing because they ain’t
got no time for him. Even in the mainstream, you talk to certain people and
they say, "Who?" But if you’re working in the music business you should know
about him, it’s part of your job, because he is definitely a heavyweight cat,
he’s made his mark. So going back to your question of hooking up with him, I’d
like to but that would be a natural process, just something that happens along
the way. But just listen to his voice, man. There’s no room right now. Audience Member He’s tight. Steve Spacek No doubt. When I look at someone like that they give me inspiration, I look up
to him because I remember him doing his thing and looking at that and hoping
to be in his situation of doing his music and putting it out, and it being
around the world. But it’s definitely a travesty. Audience Member Listening to your music anyone can speculate, there’s obviously a lot of soul
influence but also an ethereal spacey sound which is dope. I don’t think
anyone touched on that, especially dealing in a soul basis and using more
electronics. But I’m curious who in this vast world are your favourite
producers, particularly the ones who influenced your sound? Steve Spacek Well, straight away there’s Jay Dee. And I’ll tell you another interesting cat
is Giorgio Moroder. He did that electronic disco sound back in the '70s with
the Donna Summer track. I remember talking to Benji just before and being
really young in the summer holidays, they’d bring the soundsystem into school
and it’d be pumping out music, all sorts, loads of reggae, whatever, soul. And
then this track came on and I was five years old and I walked in and "boo-boo-
boo-boo" [imitates the disco beat] and it just blew me away, I didn’t
understand it. And I know now from then onwards there was a sound that was
always there, but I couldn’t get my head around it, but when I heard it, it
was speaking to me. So I think that really influenced me because as a producer
that was some sick shit because when I listen to all the stuff going around him at
the time, I’d like to meet the guy and ask him what possessed him. Maybe it
was the equipment – I’m sure some of the new stuff that was coming out – but
what possessed him to come out with that groove at that time, so early way
back when. It’s like when I think about Kraftwerk, what made them think of
that groove, that robot shit "boo-boo tch-tch" [imitates Kraftwerk beat],
what made them think of that at that time? It’s trying to get inside their
minds. It’s incredible because that’s like when you look back in history and
see these incredible leaps. I remember being a kid and seeing on TV about the
microchip. "It’s the size of a matchstick and it can make a million
calculations in one second.” What do they mean, a million calculations in one
second? I don’t understand. Then all of a sudden there’s a calculator come out
and then there’s Speak & Spell. Then I’m watching Tomorrow’s World,
which is this really good programme on in London and this dude is talk about a
sampler, E-mu. And he’s got this big bad black box with a piano on it and he’s
going, "OK, you break the glass." I’m going off on a tangent but there’s so
many things influencing me all the time, even when it’s producers, certain
things that happen, whether they be on TV or somewhere, or someone shows me a
bit of equipment. But with producers, there’s definitely Jay Dee, definitely
Giorgio Moroder, Kraftwerk. Also a lot of the jazz-funk sound in the '80s,
because that was really big in the UK, people like Kleeer and SOS Band. Marvin
Gaye when he came with "Sexual Healing," because I was really into electro at
the time, all the bodypopping and that. Then all of a sudden there’s this guy
coming with this really soulful track, but it’s got an 808 kick going on with
it [imitates "Sexual Healing" beat]. I remember the first time I heard that, it’s like Sunday afternoon, Robbie
Vincent, he used to do this soul show, and I listened to it. Marvin hadn’t
been around in a while, he’d been out in the wilderness, then this dude
somewhere in Northern Europe found him hanging out, took him over. All of a
sudden there was "Sexual Healing." Man, there’s just like so much influence
behind it, it makes so much sense. Looking back on all the Tribe stuff, De La
Soul, a lot of the early hip-hop stuff from the early '90s. A lot of us didn’t
realize Jay Dee was behind a lot of that stuff, his sound was there from back
in the day. I didn’t even know about Jay Dee back then, but all I know his sound is
reaching out to me. I’ve got so much music to make I ain’t got time to find
out who did what. But it’s cool, I’ve got all these cats around me like
Morgan, Benji, who all collect music and I’ll be like, "What’s this, what’s
that?" And they’ll show me stuff and so the stuff that reaches out to me, I
can get an idea of all these different producers. But I’m a bit of an airhead
in that respect. I’m sure there’s a lot of other cats as well, like GB. I’ve
only known his stuff for the last couple of years but he’s definitely an
influence, and he’d probably say the same about me. When I hear his music I
think, "OK, I really want to be in those places, I want to be a part of that."
Also in the early '90s, all those Detroit cats, especially people like Fingers
Inc, I remember that sound, Bam Bam "Where’s Your Child," A Guy Called Gerald
"Voodoo Ray" really influenced a lot of what I do now, me and my whole crew. Benji B Steve, thank you very, very much. [applause]

Strobocop
Since ’97, Strobocop’s label Karaoke Kalk has been pumping out bleeps and jazzy riffs to cutely destroy the prevalent cliches. Besides Karaoke Kalk, artists Takagi Masakatsu, Julee Cruise and Antonelli, label boss Thorsten Lutz likes to sit on the fence, creating his own niche next to the competing camps of post-glitch a la Mouse on Mars and minimal techno that have traditionally dominated the music scene in his hometown of Cologne. Pop sensibility finds an avant-garde outpost alongside acoustic instruments and all the nostalgia of a drunken singalong. In his lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy, Strobocop tells us about how shook off his indie roots for a life of rave.
Hosted by Nick Dwyer Welcome Mr. Thorsten Lütz, aka Strobocop [applause]. How are you, man? Strobocop Erm, sorry? Nick Dwyer How are you? Strobocop OK, a little bit nervous. Nick Dwyer Little bit nervous? Strobocop Yeah. Nick Dwyer That’s not so bad. The last few years you’ve been living in Berlin, but you’re originally from Cologne. How much of your life have you spent in Cologne? Strobocop You mean how long I was living there? Nick Dwyer Yeah. Strobocop I was born in Cologne. I’m originally from Cologne and for 32 years [I was living there]. And then there was a time to decide to see another city and to get new impressions and stuff like this. Then I decided to move to Berlin. Nick Dwyer Tell us a bit about Cologne then... I mean, Cologne as a city in terms of music over the last decade plus, you know, with the Kompakt thing and so much more, there seems to be bit of a mystique when it comes to Cologne about music. Tell us about the city. Strobocop Cologne is not a city, really. It’s a small village looking like a city. Everything is very close to each other. There is a small center and you have record shops there, all the clubs are there, the pubs are there, the bars are there, people are living there. So you have only short ways. You walk down the street and for sure you meet four or five people that you met in the bar the night before, and you say “Hello.” This is very nice on the one hand, on the other hand sometimes it gets on your nerves and it is a little bit too much. But I think this is one of the good things in Cologne, of course. I think this was the reason that a lot of labels, especially in this kind of electronica/house/techno, labels like Kompakt, Areal, Italic, maybe Karaoke Kalk and all these labels, could grow. That’s very good in this city, it’s very good for working together. Nick Dwyer So there is this feeling of camaraderie between not just what’s happening between the techno guys? Strobocop A good example is that when I started in 1997 I [didn’t] knew anything about running a label. I only had a small amount of money and a bunch of friends who started to produce music. I was DJing around that time, it was 1997, and I was thinking about what I could do next. Producing? Not really. Then I decided to do the label. For example, Wolfgang Voigt, [AKA] Mike Ink, was helping me a lot during that time. He was supporting me, I was able to ask him about anything, because he already was in this business for years and he knew exactly what to do. So it was very easy for me to find a way to do these things and start the label. Nick Dwyer You just said up to 1997 you were just a DJ. How long have you been DJing for and tell us a bit about the foundations of the music scene in Cologne, say in the ’80s, and when you first started to play records? Strobocop Well, I was starting playing records about 1989 and during that time I was more into guitar music. I was listening to My Bloody Valentine, Prefab Sprout, a lot of English bands, and I was even into hip-hop, because I think that was a really good time for hip-hop in the early ’90s and at the end of the ’80s. When I was playing I couldn’t mix, I was only playing one record after another. In 1991 I became a raver [laughs], as there were parties by a DJ team called Cosmic Orgasm. Triple R, who runs the labels Traum/Trapez, was part of that and also Bleed, who now publishes a magazine in Berlin called De:Bug. They had parties every weekend, mostly in empty factories or warehouses. It was a time in Cologne when it was still possible to find space like this, also squats and so on. Every weekend there were parties and I was really addicted, asking myself what they were doing as they played a real mixture. They would start with hip-hop. Bleed’s first track, for example, was by Paris - “The Devil Made Me Do It”. Then they would play early breakbeat stuff, and then techno. The techno was very fast. When you looked at their records they only had white labels, but they knew exactly which record it was. So I was really impressed, thinking, “Wow, this is nice.” And so I became more and more addicted to this kind of electronic music and at the same time Delirium, which was a record shop ran by the people who later were doing the Kompakt shop, was my second home. Every week I’d go there two, three times buying a lot of stuff. So I became more and more addicted to this kind of music. Nick Dwyer But this has nothing to do with your label. Strobocop Yeah, this is completely different to techno, this has nothing to do with it. Nick Dwyer Just to give people an idea. Do you have something early from the label that you like to play first? Strobocop Yeah, maybe this (shows record sleeve of Wunder). This is a record from my label Karaoke Kalk. It is called Wunder. This was the seventh release, and this was the turning point for the label because this was a great success. Before we were releasing more electronica, selling about 800 copies. Then we released this one and it exploded, at least in our terms. Nick Dwyer You had a lot of support from like the Jazzanova guys behind this. They were big fans of this record. Strobocop Yeah, could be. I don’t know [laughs]. Nick Dwyer Should we play this? What’s this track called? (music: Wunder - “Noitz’s Kakao” / applause) So tell us about this. What’s the name of this artist? Strobocop I didn’t produce it, I’ve only released it. This is a record from a guy called Jörg Follert, who is from Cologne either. Actually, he is releasing under the name of Wechsel Garland because we had some copyright problems because of the name. The name of this project was Wunder, but there is a crap guitar band in Hamburg and they really have a copyright on this name. Wunder means “miracle,” and so we decided to find another name for this project so now he’s releasing under the name of Wechsel Garland. This record is unbelievable. We released in 1998 and we’re [still] selling it. Within a year I now sold 600 or 700 copies, which is amazing, especially to Japan. The Japanese are completely addicted. We are always wondering what they are doing with them, “Wow, they’ve ordered 150 copies again, but this record is ten years old.” Nick Dwyer Wow. Strobocop They always find new people. Sometimes I think they eat the CDs or I don’t know what they’re doing with it (laughter). I can say that this is the most successful record of the label. Nick Dwyer When the label first started was it more of an album project or singles? Strobocop No, in the beginning we were only doing white sleeves, everything was very cheap. Then we had those labels. At the beginning, we’d take motives that were connected to Kalk, which was the part of Cologne we were living at. I can’t remember the story why we’ve decided to put this guy on this label (points at the label of the record). It’s a shame, I forgot. I’ve tried to find it on the internet, because there was this kind of family tragedy, but not so bad, more funny. Nick Dwyer So he’s immortalised on your first release. Strobocop Yeah, this is the first release. I think the Wunder record was the first one where we used a complete, full artwork. (music: Kandis - “Lunar Corona”) Nick Dwyer The name of the artist and the track? Strobocop The name of the artist is Kandis and the name of the track is Lunar Corona, I think. Nick Dwyer You have a DVD as well, don’t you? Strobocop Yeah, maybe if you want we can take a look. Nick Dwyer Yeah. Strobocop This is an old video from a band called Donna Regina. They’ve released on Karaoke Kalk since 1990 and it’s more pop-influenced music. (video: Donna Regina – Unknown / applause) Nick Dwyer So tell us a little bit about Donna Regina. They are two people? Strobocop Yes, they are a married couple, Günter and Regina Janssen. They are also living in Cologne and they were producing music for years and years. Before they came to Karaoke Kalk they were releasing on a label called Strangeways, and they’ve already released four records before they released their first record on Karaoke Kalk. They are one of the artists I’m working with since the beginning. Nick Dwyer Are they exclusively with your label? Strobocop Yes. Nick Dwyer They are? Strobocop Yes, until now they’ve released four albums, the fourth one was released in November of last year. Nick Dwyer Let’s say you talk to Donna Regina, and they’re going to do a new album for you, they give you an album, you love it, but maybe there are two or three tracks where you go like, “Nah.” Do you ever step in or do you let the artist have complete creative control? Strobocop The artists have complete creative control. Sometimes, not really often I decide to say, “Please think about maybe we can leave this track away or can we exchange it?” But that’s not very often. I mean, Donna Regina for example or even Wechsel Garland, I have a lot of respect for them because they are very good producers. So normally, I accept it straight away. When they give me their idea of an album I agree most of the time 100%. It’s different when I work with a newcomer or a so-called newcomer artists who never released an album before, or they release their first album on Karaoke Kalk. Then I try to get more influence, and I try to ask them if they have more tracks available, bla bla bla. Audience Member [inaudible question] Roman, Polish guy. Strobocop Roman is a Polish guy living in Cologne and he already released two albums on Karaoke Kalk. There is a new one since January this year. He’s completely [on some] other stuff, because no one understood why I released this record. Maybe to get a better impression we can hear something. Some people hate me because of that. I love it. Audience Member I love it too. Strobocop Hey, you are the other guy (laughter). First track. Nick Dwyer So how old is Roman and how long have you known him for? Strobocop I know him since three years. He came into my office saying, “Hello, I’m Roman and this is my music.” I was really into it, I really love the music. (music: Roman - “Saving Juno”) Nick Dwyer Thorsten, thank you very much. Strobocop Hey, thank you.

Sway
Don’t be surprised to learn that George Michael and Madness played a role in kicking off Sway’s career in grime. A club kid from the UK, Sway built a well-respected mixtape empire within the Empire before releasing his humbly entitled debut album This Is My Demo, picking up countless awards along the way. According to him, his success comes from an extensive knowledge of self, and more importantly, from ignoring all musical boundaries. In this talk at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, Sway discusses his love of mixtapes, his record label and the importance of musical independence.
Hosted by Benji B How are you doing, man? Sway I’m easy man, I’m cool. Benji B Yeah? Sway Yeah, man. Benji B When did you get in? Sway Yesterday. Benji B You’ve been busy recently? Sway Proper. Benji B So for those in the room that haven’t heard your name, haven’t heard your music before, could you please introduce yourself? Sway Alright. I go by the name of Sway. I’m an MC in the UK. Right now I’m out of London. The type of music I do is sometimes described as grime, sometimes described as hip-hop. It’s kind of in the middle. It’s a kind of UK hip-hop thing. The reason why I got a bit of reputation in the UK, quite known in the UK right now. As far as the underground, probably the biggest rapper in the underground crossing over. Reason being is because I’ve done everything independently and I came out differently. A lot of you probably don’t know too much about London. I’m not sure how much you know about London but it’s not like the stereotypes. A lot of people stereotype Britain as being castles and with the Queen everywhere you go, number ten Downing Street. Britain is very much like New York. When I went to New York I felt at home because London – not Britain – is very much like New York. Half of the rappers that have come over from America to perform in London have gone back to America without their jewelry. You know, it’s not a joke out in London right now. A lot of guys coming over acting like Britain is going to be tea and crumpets and they get robbed. It’s not a joke out there. I’m representing a side of London that people might not see or that might not come up on the news or in the films, you know what I mean? Yeah, that’s me. Well, there’s more. Independent, I started my own label called Dcypher Productions and all we were doing was selling mixtapes. We were selling them out of the car, driving to stores ourselves, selling them over the internet. Right after shows I would sell them and before we knew it I was the highest mixtape seller in the UK, full stop. And a lot of companies started to take notice, all magazines started writing about me and also I won five awards this year alone on the back of the mixtapes. That’s probably why my name started propelling quite fast. Benji B You’re definitely a good person to talk to about the DIY ethic of doing music. Sway won a MOBO award in the UK this year, which is quite an amazing achievement. The MOBO is the “Music of Black Origin” awards that we have in the UK and in your category there was who? Sway 50 was in the category. Benji B 50 Cent. Sway Roots Manuva, Game, Kano. That’s all I can remember. It was voted for by the British people. Benji B And that’s the significance of why we want to talk to Sway today because here is someone who basically has won a very prestigious award, well, awards, over the course of the year. He’s got records being played on daytime radio, on national radio as well, across the country, and like you say, is the highest mixtape seller in the country and he hasn’t got a record deal. Hasn’t ever signed a record deal, hasn’t ever used that machine, right? Sway Yeah, yeah. Benji B So I want to know about what it’s like doing it yourself? Sway It’s hard because the labels, they tempt me every day. From two years ago, when I first started to be played on radio, I have been getting calls from record labels wanting meetings but what I wanted to is create a demand for myself. I knew I had the talent to do what I wanted to do and I knew I had something different. The thing about me that is different to a lot of other rappers in the UK is I’m very humorous, I got a lot of humor in what I do. I got a slight comedy element to the music I do. In a place where people right now are just talking all crazy stuff. In a scene where everyone is talking about guns whatever, drugs whatever, I came out and I have done something a bit different. For example, my first track I shot a video for that was really getting played was a song called “Flo Fashion”, which was actually about credit cards and how people get into debt with credit cards. I was playing this character who ordered a credit card and was going everywhere swiping, buying this, buying that, buying this for her, him, dad, mum, whatever. And at the end of the day, I don’t know what you lot call them, the bailiffs, people that if you don’t pay your bill, they come and start taking your TV and everything. At the end of the track that’s what happens to me as the character. I don’t pay the bill and I end up in debt. I’m pretty sure that everybody out here knows somebody or is in debt themselves. Some kind of debt to a bank or whatever, not paying the bill, everybody is in debt. So it is a track that everybody around the board could relate to and it transcended into a different market for me. Benji B Have you got that with you? Sway Yeah, I got it somewhere. Benji B How long ago did you make that? Sway That track was made in 2002. Yeah, it was made in 2002 but it came out in 2004. Benji B “Flo Fashion.” (music: Sway – “Flo Fashion”/ applause) Sway Yeah, that was it basically for you lot. Sometimes when I play something like that to a crowd of people, I don’t know where you are from, I’m not sure you can understand every word I’m saying. In London I’m pretty clear. I’m probably one of the rappers with the most clarity, I would say, in the UK. But sometimes you lot, especially Americans, they still don’t get it. They don’t understand for some strange reason, I’m speaking English, you know? Your language is English but for some reason don’t understand what I’m talking about half the time. Benji B But when you go to the Bronx or Brooklyn you can understand that, right? Sway I listen to some of the most obscure hip-hop, I listen to some American artist that American people don’t even listen to. I’ll go to New York and say, “Yeah, I’m looking for the new Suga Free album,” and everyone is looking at me weird, “Who is this Suga Free guy?” It is weird. I listen to a lot of stuff and understand it. We’ve grown to understand a lot of the American slang and a lot of the sayings and things like that. But somehow, for some strange reason, we haven’t been able to get the same respect when us doing our thing. Like Dizzee, Dizzee does quite well over here. Benji B Sway Yeah. He does quite well in America as far as UK artist goes. Still, it’s not as well as he should do. He’s a very talented guy. I went on tour with Dizzee at the beginning of last year and that’s how I widened my fan base. I had a friend that knew him and then we contacted him and it was like, “Look, I just want to set up your show. Just want to start warm up the show.” He knew who I was and everything and he was like, “Yeah, I understand it, we can deal with that.” So I went on tour with him and I was just effing up the tour. Everywhere I was going I was selling no less than like 100 CDs a night. You know, just right after coming off the stage and signing them for people. That was the incentive for selling it. Just sign it and everyone wanted one. Like, I would do a freestyle where people would tell me what to rap about, and there was another thing: I was rapping about downloading, which was very current at the time because I got a track – you lot are understanding what I’m saying, right? Yeah? I got a track called “Download”, yeah? Everywhere I do that people respond to it well. What should we get onto now? Benji B We will talk about being an UK artist a bit later. I mean, you still haven’t put an actual album out of original material. There is original material on your mixtape as well, but it’s a classic mixtape, it’s you on other people’s beats and stuff like that and doing covers and whatever. Just on the mixtapes alone how many did you sell? Sway 13,000. Benji B 13,000? In the UK that’s quite a lot considering that you are doing that on your own speed. What was the inspiration for you to think, “I’m not going to go into the studio straight away, I’m going to get a mixtape and get out there?” Is that an idea borrowed from the States? Sway The whole mixtape thing is an American idea. Usually, with mixtapes from American artists is tracks that never made it to their album or tracks that are going to be really big, and they play like two seconds of it, wheel it back and throw sound effects all over it. Benji B Is that a clearance issue? Sway It’s just like, “Go and buy their album!” They play it for two seconds, wheel it back and you’re going to buy the album. You understand? It is a marketing tool. But in the UK people are getting the wrong idea. They were copying that style but nobody cared about the music, if that makes any sense. If you do a track, play two seconds and you put sound effects all over it, if you’re not Jay-Z, no one is going to want to buy the album, no one is going to care. I have done it in a different way where I put a lot of full songs on it. Practically on the two mixtapes together there are like four albums worth of original material that I could put out and call it an album. Another thing that I have done was a lot of marketing for myself. A lot of hip-hop records that are big in America are often big in the UK like three months later. Three months to six months down the line. There was that J-Kwon, dude who has done the tune “Tipsy.” I know that his record label in the UK, I can’t remember what record label it was, I know they had an office in the UK. So I knew that this record, this was before it was big in the UK, I knew that this record was going to get a major push in the UK. I knew there was going to be posters, I knew there was going to be a radio campaign on it. So I thought if I do an alternate version, a UK version, maybe every DJ that the record label gives it to, they play my version right after. So I have done my version called “Pepsi,” which was about not getting tipsy, you know? People pissing all over the toilet and stuff at house parties. Because he has done a video about a house party and it was all going well. I have done a track about the house party going terrible. I have done that, I gave it to all the DJs and it was just crazy in the UK. Benji B Blew up. Sway Yeah. Anywhere you heard “Tipsy,” right after you would hear “Pepsi” straight after. DJs were really up. The more money, the more marketing, the record label didn’t even notice. They were promoting me, they didn’t even notice, for free. Someone would say, “Have you heard the J-Kwon – ‘Tipsy?’” People would say, “No, but have you heard Sway – ‘Pepsi?’” And I started doing that. Another thing was, I won’t lie, Americans, a lot of rappers they take the piss in the UK. Take the piss, you know? Turn up late for shows. So I wanted a lot of people from America know that you can’t keep on taking the piss when our currency is actually a bit stronger than yours. They have done a competition for Nas’s album. It was called the Streets Disciple competition. Do you know “Thief’s Theme?” The album “Thief’s Theme” was on, they were like “Yes!” All the UK artists get on this competition to be on Nas' UK release. And me, personally, I thought this was a bit of a piss-take. If it is Nas' proper album and Nas respects you, he is going to holler at you and let you be on his album, but to do a competition to exploit the UK market I thought was a piss-take. Benji B He should be on the album full stop. Sway Exactly. Don’t try and exploit the market. And there were a lot of good rappers who were entering this competition. I was speaking to people like, “This is a kid’s thing. Ain’t no competition to be on an album, just do your own thing.” But I, however, did enter the competition but the version of “Thief’s Theme” that I gave in was not what they expected. I didn’t enter to win, I entered to let people know that he need to stop taking the piss when it comes to hip-hop. I have done a version called “The Robber’s Theme” and I play that to you now. Benji B Yeah, we gotta hear that. Sway Yeah, that has done quite well in the UK. Benji B ”The pound is stronger than the dollar.” Sway Yeah, it starts with the line ”The pound is stronger than the dollar.” (music: Sway – “The Robber’s Theme” / Sway fades music) As you might have guessed I never won the competiton or nothing. I made an impact. Benji B So tell me a little bit about the variety of styles you grew up with musically and what your background is and that kind of thing. Sway Growing up, I was into all different kinds of music. From groups like Madness, which is a really big UK group, that’s one of my favorite groups of all time. Anything from Madness to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, very into Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. A lot of people didn’t understand what they were saying. I used to rewind and try to find out what they were saying. Proper Bone Thugs-N-Harmony fan. On the flipside I was into George Michael. I won’t lie. I had the CD. When the boys used to come around I would hide it [laughter]. I would play it when no one was around, different diversities. I was into drum & bass, my cousins do drum & bass. They are like part of the Metalheadz clique, which blew up like five or ten years back. Benji B Who was that? Sway DJ Ink and Loxy. Benji B Right, right. Sway They are my family members under Goldie and that. So it’s like all different kinds of music, man. I didn’t discriminate. I was really into MC Hammer. I won’t lie, MC Hammer, Kriss Kross, you name it. Music with a lot of commercial appeal. But at the same time I could get down with N.W.A.. I was never anything fake. A lot of people were fake, they pretended that they only were into the hardcore because they thought they were them kind of people. I know what kind of person I am so I can listen to whatever I want. No one is going to tell me shit. Yeah, so I was very broad-minded about music, from rock to hip-hop. The other thing is that I was born in London but my parents are from West Africa, a place called Ghana. When I was born a couple of months later I was taken to Ghana, I stayed there a couple of years, I came back just in time to start school. When I came back I had a strong African accent, very African morals within me. At the same time when I was growing up I learned to adapt to the whole British culture. That is something that comes out in both of my styles. One thing about being an artist, if you’re going to stand out, you can’t sound like anybody. People are going to make comparisons forever. You need someone to make comparisons and you have to see it as a positive thing. When I first came out and people were like, “Ah, UK Ludacris, Slick Rick, Dizzee.” I was getting a lot comparisons and I was getting angry. I was like, “What the fuck are they talking about, I’m Sway! Why do they keep on making those comparisons?” But after a while you realize, number one: People need to identify you by something in order to get their mind around it. And number two: When people are comparing you to acts on a big caliber you need to know that it is somewhere where you can go, and they are seeing you on a big level. Benji B It’s a big compliment. Sway Yeah, as a compliment. If people were comparing me to crap acts, this is where you need to start questioning them, like, “What are you talking about?” But to be compared to some of the biggest acts in hip-hop was a good thing for me. As an artist you have got to take the elements that make you. Nobody is going to have the exact same combination of elements. Your dad might be Polish, your mum might be Swedish and you were born in Zambia or something like that. You’ve got to put that all into your music because 50 Cent’s dad ain’t Polish, you understand? He’s not going to have the same style as you. You need to put all your personal heritage and stuff into your music and create yourself a niche. That’s what I did. There was no one doing what I have done, like merging the whole African with the British humor along with the American influences within hip-hop, and that’s why I managed to get through a lot more. Benji B Let’s talk about finding your identity musically, because certainly with hip-hop it’s very significant. You’re basically the first generation in the UK that has really spoken on records like you speak in real life. In the UK we went through quite a few years of people wanting to sound as American as possible when they were recording hip-hop. How important is that to you to just represent? Because in a way the whole point of hip-hop has always been about representing where you’re from anyway. Sway Exactly. That’s hip-hop for you, man. I don’t want to feel like I’m slagging off Americans all the time. With all respect, but a big American rapper came to London recently. I don’t want to say his name. Not even that big, he’s alright. He requested to see me and he was like, “I heard you’re the hottest thing,” and blah blah. And the first thing I said to him was, “You don’t respect.” That kind of threw him off, called the meeting off and everything, and he went wherever he went, and I went where I went. Sometimes you have to let people know. A lot of TV, like MTV for us, you turn on the TV in Britain, a lot of American programs. We get everything, don’t get it twisted. Sex and the City, we’ve got Seinfeld, Frasier, Simpsons, whatever. A lot of American crap on the TV. Naturally, when you do entertainment yourself you mimic your idea of entertainment. For example, one of the biggest acts to come out of the UK and do hip-hop is Slick Rick. When he went over his accent was there, but he took in American culture a lot. The thing that separated him from a lot of people was that he had a little bit of the British twang. He never had it that strong. He had a little bit of the twang, and he had the British humor and he was doing the American stuff. It was like something different for them. There is another crew called who were destined to do a big thing. Dash came over and he messed them about a bit. Damon Dash was saying he was going to sign them and all that, and he never [did]. So they ended up rolling with Dipset, and now they represent Dipset in the UK. They’re doing their thing, and there is a lot of American artists realising that, “Look, those British boys got something going on,” and everybody wants their DTP UK or Def Jam UK. There are a lot of things going on. It is important the way I speak and make sure you lot understand. Over the years we’ve learned to understand how a lot of you lot speak. It is equally as hard to understand what a lot of American rappers are saying as it is to understand what a lot of British people are saying. Come, work together and work at it. Benji B And what do you think is the potential for it to cross over? Because even within in the UK a lot of music that you’ve been talking about, and the artists that you’ve been talking about are very London-centric. Sway Yeah, definitely. Benji B So it’s about what is the potential to break out of London into the UK, one, and then two, into the rest of the world? Sway Out of London into the UK you need to have that X-factor, you need to have something different that’s going to transcend. London is London and Coventry is Coventry. You can’t just say “Great Britain” and that’s it. They are very different societies, very different culturally. London is very multi-cultural. There is everybody over there, black, white, Asian, you name it, all in London. But a lot of other places in Britain there is mainly a white population, excluding Birmingham, Manchester. Benji B The major cities basically. Sway Yeah, exactly. Most of the major cities are very multi-cultural and a lot of artists forget that sometimes in their streak zone. When they make music they’re making music purely for the streets, and you know the subject matters that someone living on a farm in Coventry can’t relate to. They might have a gun as well, but it might be a different type of gun and he be shooting cows instead of people [laughter]. Like, he can’t relate to what people are talking about in the manner all the time. When artists remember that and they start talking about universal topics, that’s when you transcend into the UK. As far as breaking out nobody in the UK has really broke out properly, on a hip-hop, on a urban level I should say. No one has really done that, so there is still opportunity for someone to come out and do that. I don’t know who that might be, but there is still opportunity for someone to come out and do that. I think that not just Americans, but people around the world in general, Germany, France, Sweden, are getting their head around the fact that we’re going to keep our accents and that we’re going to do what we’re doing. We are going to be taken seriously. You ask Mario Winans how serious London is, he’ll tell you, because he didn’t go back with his jewelry [laughter]. Who else? Ja Rule, that guitar chain he had someone was wearing it around the corner from me. I know the person that took it. He came back to America and he got another one made. I’m telling you this as a fact, Ja Rule got robbed. Barefaced, I was there when it happened. A lot of people when they leave and come back to America they don’t tell everybody what it’s like. They don’t tell everybody, but I’m telling you firsthand as a Londoner, it’s not no joke. We’re people to be taken seriously and we’re not going to stop doing what we’re doing until we start getting taken seriously. Benji B On the subject of London and other artists coming up now, there is a lot of press around the world about the grime scene. Maybe you could just articulate that for people that don’t have first hand knowledge of grime and UK hip-hop, and where everything fits in your mind. Sway OK. There’s a war going on in the UK right now, and it’s between two scenes, which are very similar. Now, I don’t come into this war because apparently I’m both of the styles of music. You got grime and you got UK hip-hop. I don’t know if anybody has heard of Blak Twang. Anybody heard of Blak Twang? He’d be a good representative of UK hip-hop. Good UK hip-hop, not like fake UK hip-hop, that’s Blak Twang. Let me say someone else as I keep only saying this guy. Who else? Let me think who else is representative. Have you heard of Wiley? Wiley, he’s a good representation of grime. So you got Wiley on one side and Blak Twang on the other. Now grime is a very street music, it is very street. You could have like five words in a whole verse for grime. This is a quote from a really grand rap, “Ah, I’ll crack your skull / Ah, I’ll crack your skull,” and he just keeps on saying it, and everybody goes mad for it. What else is there? Grime is really grimey, it is real street music. Benji B Give us some other grime hooks. Sway Grime hooks? Benji B Yeah. Sway ”You don’t want to bring arm’s house / I’ll bring arm’s house to your mum’s house.” What else is there? “Killer, killer, real real / killer, killer, still, still / If you don’t like killer you can suck your mum.” This is quotes from grand artists. Grime is crazy. When you see the energy of grime it is a very street music. Whereas UK hip-hop is more laid back, intellectual type lyrics. It is the difference between 50 Cent and the Roots. Benji B But it’s also a tempo thing. Sway It is. Grime is very energetic and fast, you know? It is good, it is a breakthrough music. Benji B And that’s about 140 BPM? Sway 135 to 140, yeah. But a lot of hip-hop stuff is starting to become that tempo through the Dirty South stuff. Benji B Exactly, and that’s where the crossovers come in the UK because a lot of grime people relate a lot to crunk, kind of. Sway Yeah, Lil’ Jon came over and he loved grime, you know? He was at all the grime events. Benji B Because it’s like that type of half-step thing. Sway Exactly. It is a very similar type of music. I could play you an example that kind of sits on both sides, UK hip-hop and grime. This is a track that everybody related to, because I made it like an anthem for the UK. It’s me featuring my guy Pyrelli and it is called “Up Ur Speed”. Meaning, “just get off of your ass and do something.” Not up your speed on the road or drive faster. Has anyone heard of Fleetwood Mac? We’ve interpolated a track called “The Chain” by Fleetwood Mac, which they cleared surprisingly. Because I’ve been doing a lot of interpolations that people don’t clear. So we got it cleared, shot a video for it and everything and it is called “Up Ur Speed.” (music: Sway feat. Pyrelli – “Up Ur Speed”) Sway That’s a perfect example of UK hip-hop / grime. [applause] Benji B So we have talked about grime, talked about UK hip-hop, but basically, when it comes down to it, the importance, especially after you’ve been talking about America and all that stuff, really the reason you bringing all that up is because it is important to build something yourself. Sway Yeah, definitely, man. Benji B Build your own scene, and that is what we’re talking about here, right? It doesn’t matter if you are from Venezuela, or Sweden, or whatever. Basically it is, “Do you.” Sway You know what, lad? Bottom line is if you’re building up and create your own undeniable height, people are going to be on to you. You can’t go to these record labels, especially these major record labels. It doesn’t make no sense. You have to realize this is where people, a lot of artists get it twisted and they get their feelings hurt. A record label, particularly a major one, is a business. That’s all it is, a business, a way of making money, you understand? They sell chocolate bars, if that makes any sense. They don’t know what they’re made of, don’t give a toss who made them. As long as the people that come into the store like the chocolate bars, they sell it to you. They don’t care what’s in them, anything. They sell chocolate bars just like the man in the store on the corner. He sells chocolate bars, he doesn’t give a toss who’s made it or what they’re made of. Understand, that’s a record label. Now what you have to do for record labels, you have to build up a demand for your chocolate bar. You have to give people a taster, let people taste it. So they can go to the store and say, “Yeah, I like this.” You have to make your own one, and that’s basically what I did. I came up through the battle scene before 8 Mile came out and it got all commercial. There was a battle scene in the UK and I was part of it, I was doing my thing on that. I was good in cussing kids, as a kid in school, you know? People didn’t really want to chat shit to me because I was just going to embarrass you. I was that type of kid, I would dedicate the whole lesson to embarrassing you. I have done that. Once I’ve learned how to rhyme it was a dangerous combination of being able to cuss people while rhyming at the same time. I took that combination to the battle stage and hurt a lot of feelings. After a while it got overrated and everyone was getting involved and I ducked out blissfully because I didn’t want to be known as a battle MC. I love the tracks you’ve heard today. In fact, all of the tracks you’ve heard today I produced them myself. I was actually into production before rapping. I got a four-track when I was 14, beatboxed one part, then done the bassline with my mouth on the second track, and then the hi-hats on the third track, and then just rapped over the fourth track. I was very into that, I had a Fostex, some old Fostex that I had for like five years. After a while, when I left school, I started doing what I needed to do I got myself some money and bought myself an MPC and started building on that. I don’t sample a lot in my music, if I get an idea I get a bassline, someone that plays the bass to come and play the bassline. Or someone who can actually play the keys to come and do that. So a lot of my music has got a live element feel and at the same time an electrical feel because I dabble with things myself. So it’s not about waiting for the record labels, and for the UK, I’m the perfect example of someone not waiting for the record labels. Now, potentially I’ve got the option of five record labels I could go to tomorrow, including three majors and two major independents. Everyone is interested in taking my whole Dcypher imprint because of what I’ve built up. I proved that I could make eight out of ten people like what I’m doing once exposed to it, and that can multiply. The way they see it is if you can make eight out of ten people like what you’re doing, you can make 16 out of 20, and so on. Even if you’re in a small environment of people that are not really into your kind of music, you got to exploit yourself within your environment. That’s how you get ripples, you cause ripples and it transcends into other markets. That’s all I can say, man. The independent way is the best way, it is the best way forward for people that want to be good creatively. If you want to be a pop band and you just want to sing songs that other people wrote for you, then fair enough. Go to a record label, I’m sure they’ve got a million songs and songwriters that sit there all day writing formulas that are going to do well. If you’re good looking and all that, you can do that. On the other hand, I’m very creative and I don’t want anybody telling me anything about my music. So the only way I can prove to people that my music is what is going to be going on, is by letting the people talk, and that’s what I’ve done. I gave it straight to the people, and the people gave it to the press, and the press gave it to the labels. That’s how it worked. Benji B But you didn’t just give it to the people, I mean, you were literally everywhere for a while. How old are you? Sway 23. Benji B You’re 23 and you basically got the game sussed. Well, certainly from a London perspective better than most people ten years your senior. It is an amazing situation, you are doing completely you, purely you, and being you, and doing what you do creatively, but you’ve already talked about subject matters so you can bring in people outside your immediate surroundings. You’ve already talked about thinking, “I’m going to do this record because I know it’s going to get promotion and therefore I’m going to get promotion.” A lot of what you’re doing, especially with the mixtapes and the way that you’ve achieved what you’ve achieved so far and so young, has been very calculated and clever in sussing out the business. How are you so business savvy at such an early stage in your career? Sway A lot of business, like I gave that whole chocolate analogy, is common sense, you know? People like it, they buy it. It’s that simple. There is no weird science to it, no nothing. But in order to get people to like it they have to be exposed to it. You’ve got to expose it to the people. If they like it, you take it. It’s really simple, it’s playschool stuff. I can tell a three-year-old this stuff. A lot of people get caught up in the whole industry. You don’t have to learn everything about the technical side, about what companies and agencies such and such is signed to. Just make your music! Make your music, there are people that go to university and study these things, management. There are lots of people in the equation that could be doing them things for you. You just have to focus on your music and make sure that the music you’re creating is original, stand out, and the most important thing: Music that you enjoy, music you’re happy with. Because if you make music that you don’t enjoy, it is detectable. You can see someone who is making music for the money and they usually don’t get that far. You can see people who are doing it for the passion. It is a combination of things, and I forgot to say: Luck. Don’t get it twisted, you can be the most talented person in the world with the most amazing songs. If you play it to a crowd of people who can’t do anything for you, then you’re fucked, basically. Luck will put a person who knows a person who knows a person in that room of ten people for you. You have to create your own luck, you’ve got to give yourself loads of avenues. You can’t just be in one place and hope that someone is going to be there. It’s like you said that I was everywhere for a while. I was on lots of people’s tracks, I was in every club selling the CDs, outside of the club selling the CDs. Benji B That’s a good point, because when you were talking about work rate, you’re definitely not too cool for school. Sway Yeah, of course not. Benji B You’re there giving the CD out outside the club, you’re there everywhere, you weren’t too cool to do any of that stuff. Sway You shouldn’t be. Benji B Talk to me a little bit about your work ethics on that level. Sway A lot of artists have got their whole mind frames caught up in the whole pride thing, like, “I don’t have to be outside the clubs selling the CD.” But they don’t sell in the stores either, so what do you want to do? You just want to sit there with a box of CDs? I didn’t want to sit there with a box of CDs, so I thought I’d go directly to the people. I’d take my little Discman play it to people. If I’m in the car, I play it for people through the car and be like, “You like this? Blah, blah, blah,” and I play them the stuff I like the most. I rarely missed a sell. I rarely, rarely missed a sell. This whole thing, lad, it’s getting a bit dangerous now. Every now and then when I can read the crowd well I go into the crowd after show, speak with the people, see what they appreciate. People are like, “I like this lyrical view of Sway. I like that track, why don’t you make it a single?” Only recently I’ve been getting into confrontations into the crowd because you’ve got people that don’t like to see you doing well. That’s just life. Don’t go on like something you’re not, understand? A lot of people go on like divas before their time. You haven’t made any money, you haven’t done shit, you’re nothing. You have to remember that. At this moment in time you need people more than people need you. Whatever it takes, if you have to be a runner in the studio making tea for people, do it! Swallow your pride and do it. It’s nothing, you’re making tea for people who are in a higher position than you. And another thing I tell people: If someone is in a higher position than you, never make them feel threatened. Don’t go into a record label and let people know you know everything. The minute you do that they feel threatened and they don’t feel in the position of power, and they just shun you, they push you to the side. You have to go in dumb, you understand? You have to go in dumb, you have to make people feel like they’re teaching you something. That’s the way they take you under the wing. They take you under the wing before they know that you passed them you move on to the next person. Act all dumb, you understand? That’s life, you act all dumb. I’m only telling you lot this, I’m only telling you lot this. I knew a lot of stuff about the music industry before I got into it properly. But I played dumb with a lot of people, I acted like I don’t know what I was doing half of the time. I acted like everything was luck. People didn’t know that I’ve calculated the whole “Pepsi” thing. People thought it was just a beat I came and spat over. I knew it was going to be big, I’ve done my research. I saw it was big in America, I was looking for the next big thing. One real rule is: People in the position of power – please don’t make them feel threatened. Because once you do that you ruin your chances of going past them. They are going to be on the edge and they are going to be alert to what you’re dealing with. These are my tips for you lot. Benji B Well, you got a lot of things sussed [laughter]. Sway Yeah. A lot of people are probably sitting there thinking, “He’s only 23 what is he talking about?” But I’m only 23 and I’ve done it, haven’t I? So you have to listen [laughter]). Benji B Definitely. And one thing that I think is amazing is that you’ve done it, but totally on your own terms. You’re not in any box, you can literally do anything tomorrow and people would accept it because they don’t say, “Oh, no, no, no, no, he does like grime, or he only does soul, or he only does hip-hop.” How do you avoid the box? Sway When I’ve first done this mixtape thing, basically this is… [shows mixtape] You can see it on two front covers of the mixtape. The first mixtape, the initial idea was to let it sell for three months, make enough money to make the money back and then make the next one. But it sold for longer than three months. When I was ready with the next one I was going to the stores and they were still ordering the first one. So it didn’t make sense to put the second one in the stores. So I let it branch out for longer and stuff like that. On the mixtapes there is a range of different styles, from fast to really slow to grime to hip-hop to drum & bass. All of my influences came out on the mixtapes and it means like throwing all ideas together. I’m a perfectionist, but I had to swallow my pride on the mixtapes and experiment. I had to put things out there that I wasn’t 100% sure of within my heart. I had to do that. There’s a lot of people in their bedrooms crafting the most best masterpiece ever, which will never come out, because they don’t know when it’s got to that masterpiece stage. I had to swallow my pride and just really get rid of my perfectionist’s self and to say, “Look, I’ve done this track I need to know how people feel about it.” And trust me, people’s opinions can manipulate how you feel about your own music. Believe it or not. If you make a track that you’re not certain of, there’s a reason why you’re not certain of it. You’ve got the capacity to love it and you’ve got the capacity to hate it. Sometimes people out there make that decision for you. You don’t have to be embarrassed or feel like you don’t know what you’re doing if you’re not sure about a track. There’s a reason why it was made in your mind, because somewhere along the line you’ll like it or you like the direction it was going in. I don’t believe in people holding back material or waiting. Just lay it all out there. Like I said, the more lottery tickets you buy the more chance there is of you winning the lottery. You buy one ticket, you got one chance of winning this. It’s as simple as that. Come up with an idea that’s good enough quality-wise, well presented, put it out there, give it to people. Give it to DJs. Get feedback. Get opinion. Get people talking about you to other people and so on. Benji B So you basically didn’t pigeonhole yourself early on, that’s the key? Sway It is. The first impressions are really important. Sometimes first impressions are really hard to erase. If you come in a certain way people expect you to maintain that sort of style. Some people can’t come out of the music they make. I’ve worked with a lot of people like that. Making a certain style of music. You can tell that they want to come out of that box, but they’re scared about how the public are going to feel. Benji B How thick is your skin when it comes to criticism? Sway In the beginning I was taking criticism bad. I won’t lie to you. The first track I put was called “On My Own” and was the first track after the whole battle thing. People were like, “Sway can do a track like that?” It was a very personal track, very dark, very about my life at the time. The things I was saying in that track that I don’t agree with, and it was very personal. I remember a journalist from a magazine really dissing it, really going at me. I don’t know who this guy was or where he was from, but for some reason he didn’t like me, and I thought it was on a personal level. For a minute we were going to look for him and make him change the article. I was really considering looking for this guy. Chasing up people, you know, but we were chasing him in a good way, “I really want to speak to this guy, talk about doing some work.” People were giving us the contact. And then it came to the point where we either hurt this guy and have everybody label me a thug in the industry. In Britain it is not like in America. You can’t bully your way in the industry. They just call the police and that’s it, you understand? You can’t go into a record label and go on like, “Sign me!” They would just be like, “No!” Haul me out, put in 999, which is like 911. “Sway is here making noise!” And I would go to prison [laughter]. You just have to be normal, man. I thought, “Alright, I have to swallow it. If I ever meet him, I’m going to tell him what I think about him. I’m not going to touch him.” That’s how it was, but after a while a lot of people started giving me good reviews. I still get the oddball every now and then that doesn’t understand me. When people don’t understand things, it’s just wack. I’ve got a lot of up-and-coming people around me that are going through what I was going through with these people. You’re going to get bad criticism, you’re going to get bad feedback. The funny thing about it is that nine out of ten people can say that your track is the best, the most wonderful track they’ve ever heard in their life. That one person that says, “Your track is shit!” is the person that you’re going to be interested in the most. It is the one that is going to throw you off, and it is actually the guy you’re going to listen to. You’re going to be angry and hurt. Don’t think that way. Think about the nine people that like your track. If it is good music, remember he’s outnumbered. Come on, man. I used to get that all the time, get loads of good reviews and one bad one will come up and will ruin my whole day. You forget about the good ones easily. When something is good just realize it. Cut the ratios. When you get nine bad ones and one good one, that’s when you need to stop going to university and start finding a job to do [laughter]. Benji B We’ve got a lot of producers in this room and it will be definitely of interest to know that on the material we’ve been hearing you’re not just on the mic, you’re on the boards as well. You produced most of your own stuff, right? Sway Yeah. Benji B It is amazing that you’re basically the business man, the entrepreneur, the MC and the producer all in one. Could you tell me a bit about producing and your take on that, and what’s important to you when it comes to producing music? Sway For me, it’s all the same game. Production, rapping, it’s the same game. Rapping, my mouth is just another instrument to me, the words I use are other keys, that’s how it works. It is the same thing. You’ll find a lot of producers, a lot of rappers that can produce, a lot of producers that can rap. A lot of them make beats and do raps in their head. Never let it out. Or they make a beat and they think, “Oh, this guy would sounding good over it,” and they start rapping someone else’s lyrics in their head. That means you’ve got the capacity to rap. A true musician makes the music and does the lyrics, everything. Because of the way the industry is now, it is kind of surprising to find someone who raps, and produces, and plays an instrument. That’s like amazing, because the industry has gone so poppy and so artificial that it’s actually amazing to find something as simple as that. As far as I’m concerned, if you write the songs, you should be able to sing them. That’s just my mentality. If you can’t sing that song, just don’t write it. Don’t write for other people giving your ideas and stuff to other people. It’s your personality that’s going into the music, so you’re going to deal with that yourself. What was the original question? Benji B With the production thing, seeing as we were talking about the do-it-yourself ethic, what basic equipment did you make all of the original mixtape stuff on? You must have been 17, 18 years? Sway Nah. I’ve been working on an MPC since like I was 16. I only used the MPC for the drums, I don’t use it for anything else. Every now and then, like, if I don’t have enough space or anything, I like to sample through what I’ve done onto the MPC and just put the whole beat on there. As far as I’m concerned, I’ve tried a lot of other modules for drums and MPCs are the best. Sound module-wise I use a Novation for basslines whenever I’m playing stuff, JV-1080. I’ve got a couple of other sound modules. I’m a bit scared of the whole “everything on the computer” thing. That kind of messes with my head, I can’t comprehend it, can’t get around it yet. So I still use a lot of things and sync them up. Benji B When you’re 23 and you’ve had street success and musical people love what you’re doing, and you’ve got a lot of play on specialist radio, and you want to go to the next stage, and you’ve got five different labels, three of whom are major labels who in the UK aren’t really signing anyone, no one’s getting signed that isn’t truly pop, to have those deals on the table, how are you able to just walk away from that and say, “You know what? I’m not really ready for that yet?” Sway It’s got to a point where I need to see how that does in February in order to sign to any of them. Benji B But you’re putting it out yourself is what I’m saying. Sway Yeah, it’s coming out on my own label. Benji B How do you afford to make an album that is properly mastered? Sway Music pays for itself after a while. You just need to get that initial money. The first mixtape I was selling paid for the second mixtape which helped pay for the video and pay for recording of the album. It’s a snowball effect. In the beginning when I dropped my first mixtape I never even had a manager. Everyone was phoning me direct, magazines were phoning me direct and I’d speak to them. I never had a press guy and I got press. Probably out of the urban artists I got the most press in the UK. People are so interested in what I’m doing. Benji B Did you do the “Little Derek” song? Sway Nah, I haven’t produced that. That was produced by Shux. Benji B Let’s check that out, that’s the next single, right? Sway Yeah. Shux is the guy I was telling you about who plays all the instruments, he’s really good. I told him what I wanted for that song, what type of feel I wanted to go for. I came back the next day and he came up with that beat, with the “Little Derek” beat. Benji B What did you tell him? Sway I told him that I wanted the harpsichords. Told him I wanted something very vintage. A very British feel to it. But at the same time I’m very into West Coast music like as far as that American, I’m very into West Coast. DJ Quik is one of the best producers of all time, one of my favorites. Nothing is messing with them kind of boys there. So I’ve told him that I wanted like a live bassline, because a lot of West Coast people they do live bass instrumentation. But I wanted it to move like my flow. I wanted it to move like how I flow. This is what he came up with and I’ve done over it. The track is called Little Derek because my real name is Derek, and it is about me growing up. (music: Sway – “Little Derek” / applause) Benji B And who’s the guest MC on that one? Sway A girl called Baby Blue, one of the hottest female rappers in the UK right now. I’ve done a lot of work with her. Benji B So apart from the album coming out in February, what does the future hold for Sway? What do you like to be doing in three years’ time? Sway Films. I’m really, really, really into films. I’m really, as you could’ve probably guessed from my rap style, I’m very dramatical. Films is the next step for me as far as writing them. I’ve been stuck on one for like four years, like writing one. It’ll finally get finished one day. But I kind of like go to it, write a bit, come back the next day, leave it for a couple of weeks, write. I’m not going to say that it is cool, but it is probably be my first ever film. Benji B As a screenwriter? Sway Yeah. I’m writing it how I write my songs. The way it is, it is very poetic. A very poetic film. The way people are going to be speaking, everyone is going to sound like me in the film. If that makes any sense, but different personality than me. It’s going to be weird. I don’t want to talk too much about it because it is not done, and I’m stuck with that scene right now, so it’s frustrating. Yeah, films, music, this This Is My Demo project is exactly what it was intended to be: my demo project. I really wanted to see the response of it. I wanted to see how well it does, how far it goes. That’s how I learn off that. There are a lot of set up songs on it, meaning for example that “Pretty Ugly Husband,” the one with the man beaten up. On the second album the track is getting done again, but it’s from the kid’s perspective. Now there was a kid involved in that story that I don’t mention. But if you hear it, the man gets shot at the end, and it’s actually the kid that does him. So it’s going to be exactly the same story again but with the child. Instead of rapping as the husband beating up the wife, rapping as the child witnessing all this happen. This continuation on my third album as well. I do a lot of planning, and I do a lot of writing beforehand. A lot of tracks, I wrote them in 2002, 2003. I moved on and done new tracks, but they can’t come out until all of the other stuff is exploited, because I feel it’s good enough to go. I’m very into people being real. Benji B What are some of the artists you feel represent that? Sway Tech N9ne, I like Tech N9ne a lot. Don’t know if you’ve heard of him [turns to audience audience]. You haven’t heard of Tech N9ne? Well, that’s a first. What else? Not that many people, you know? Tech N9ne [laughter]. Suga Free. Audience member Who else would you reckon from the London or perhaps North London scene that other people should hear about? Sway Pyrelli, my protégé. Not even my protégé, I shouldn’t call him that. My partner, Pyrelli. He’s something different, he’s a lot more abstract than me. Audience member You called him your favorite rapper in the past. Sway Yeah, definitely, and that’s not even because I roll with him. He’s inspired me a lot, we learned from each other a lot. It’s like we feed off the back of each other crazy. You got like the girl you heard on my track, Baby Blue. You got Bruiser, who is like the ultimate British hooligan. “That’s how it is. Give me some. Let’s have him.” He’s really crazy. You hear Bruiser in the studio he’s banging his head all over the place. Bruiser is crazy. Obviously, the Streets, I respect the Streets a lot, Basement Jaxx a lot. Audience member Biggs. Sway Biggs, yeah. I was going to get to Biggs. Don’t tell him I didn’t say it. Biggs, Wiley, Dizz. Who else is there? Who else is coming through? A couple of people, there are a lot of artists coming through, but it takes a lot of tracks for me to put you in my list. It takes a lot of versatility and a “can you do it again?” kind of thing. Benji B And what about just music people, not necessarily MCs or vocalists? Sway Music in general? Benji B Coming from any style. Sway What? Current music or? Benji B New, old, whatever. Sway New, old. A lot of different people, man. I won’t lie. My favorite artist of all time, and this is never going to change, is Michael Jackson. I don’t care what anybody says. If he’s done it, I don’t know if he’s done it or not. You know, people should keep their children away from him [laughter]. If you don’t want Michael to touch your children, tell them to stop leaping on him. He’s got Neverland, so obviously children are going to go there. Just don’t let your kids go there and there won’t be no problem. I won’t lie [laughter]. I don’t know if he’s done it or not. I want to believe he didn’t do it because I like him a lot. I like his music a whole lot. Michael, Prince, Coldplay. Who else is really doing it for me? A lot of different people have influenced me, man. It’s a bit hard to say. Ludacris. I like Ludacris a lot. I think he’s one of the most underrated. Even though he’s really successful, I feel on a credibility level people don’t rate him as much, people believe this is club... 50 Cent is actually a really good rapper, he’s really good as conveying his messages and getting things across. He’s got his formula on lock. Most of the successful people are actually the best at what they do. A lot of people are like, “They’re crap,” but they dumb down their formula. When you hear a lot of these successful rappers in their raw days, they’re really raw. They dumbed it down for commercial appeal. Benji B Would you do that? Sway Clarity-wise not dumb down, but sometimes I use language that is universal to others. There are some things that I don’t say in my everyday speech that I might say in a lyric, because I want people to understand it. If you want to sell records and you want to make money through doing music, you have to meet the consumer halfway. You have to, it’s just a fact. You have got to meet the consumer half way. Benji B At what point does that become you compromising the art side? Not just the language you’re using to communicate. You were just talking about the creative stuff and you’re saying that when you’re in the label you don’t want to take the deal, because you want it on your terms, and you want to be able to do it without compromise. If you have to meet your consumer halfway and the consumer is not really what you’re about, then where do you draw that line? Sway Are you asking me if the consumer’s not what I’m about? Benji B No, I mean, if you have to meet the consumer halfway and the consumer is not necessarily in the purest way, where do you draw that line of compromise artistically? Sway Wherever you feel comfortable. If you’re doing something that you’re not comfortable with, that’s the line drawn already, that’s when you cross the line. Girls can be also known as “gash” in London. I could say, “The other day I phoned my gash.” But it wouldn’t work well in Germany or Switzerland. People would be like, “What is a gash?” People are going to be, “What the hell is he talking about? He phoned his gash. What is that?” My compromise for that would be, “The other day I phoned my girl.” It’s that simple. It’s not like, “Alright, I’m going to do something no one’s going to understand.” That’s my idea of compromising. It’s nothing deep, it’s nothing that I’m ashamed of, or nothing that I hide. It just makes the job easier. I want to be successful, I do want to sell records, of course. Everybody wants to move their parents and all of that. I want to do a lot of stuff. Audience member You’re talking about women from the UK. I was thinking about growing up it was a kind of a headtrip to find out like Monie Love who’s there of the Native Tongues, especially on the “Ladies First” track with Queen Latifah, and then she started breaking down the whole and rap more in that kind of slang real quick. I was just wondering how you guys perceived her being that when she came over, especially with her hits “Monie in the Middle” and all that, she completely was rapping straight like American. How did you all perceive that? And then my follow-up question is going from Monie to a more current person, I’ve been hearing a lot about the Lady Sovereign chick with the grime scene and stuff, and I just wanted to hear your thoughts on her as well. Sway First of all, Monie Love. I grew up on Monie Love, didn’t I? I love Monie Love. She’s given a lot of stuff, but she wasn’t different to the American movement that was going on at the time. We didn’t see her as a UK artist representing for us in America. We just saw her as part of the American movement. The same way we saw Slick Rick. He wasn’t a representative because she had the American twang speaking. Yeah, she was born in the UK, but it didn’t matter to us. We’ve got a lot of love for her, but she doesn’t stand out from Queen Latifah to us. The same way Queen Latifah represents music to me is the same way Monie Love represents music. I don’t see them as anything different. The whole Lady Sovereign thing is… Lady Sovereign is cool, she’s alright. In the scene that I come from, in the beginning a lot of people weren’t taking her seriously. She just does her thing like another person doing her thing on Channel U, MTV Base. But I’ve been hearing a lot of stuff recently, not musically, but hype-wise. Jay-Z signed her to Def Jam in America and all of that hype. It goes through and people are listening, but I don’t know how well she’ll do musically. Me personally think that she’s talented, but I haven’t heard enough of her to make a proper judgement of whether I like her or not. You have to remember, when something is as raw as grime, the representatives you get from that scene might not be the real true representation of that scene. The people from that scene, they grimey, is what it is. They don’t even have money to come out of their houses half of the time. Let alone go to America and start doing shows. Some of the big, big names are people you wouldn’t have heard of. Yeah, Lady Sovereign came out of the grime scene and everything, but she’s not one of the major players within that scene. Not at all.

Toshio Matsuura
One of the pioneers of the acid jazz sound, and member of the seminal production outfit United Future Organisation, Toshio Matsuura has been a driving force on the Japanese music scene for two decades. These days, he works on a solo tip: most notably on a James Brown remix that turned more than just a few heads. In this lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy, Matsuura joins Gerd Janson to dive into his fascinating work.
Hosted by GERD JANSON We've got a gentleman from Japan here by the name of Toshio Matsuura. He's one of the founding members of a group called UFO, United Future Organization, and they started out during the very early ‘90s on Talkin' Loud. Like, then Gilles Peterson was still an A&R at Talking Loud, and there was this wonderful genre called acid jazz or dancefloor jazz where people tried to melt jazz aesthetics with club aesthetics. Please give him a very warm welcome. [applause] TOSHIO MATSUURA My name is Toshio. I'm happy to come here. At first, I want to say ... I just fly out this morning, and I fly back tomorrow morning, so I'm spacey now. I want to talk, communicate with you guys more smooth. That's why [inaudible] of me. [inaudible] really explain more comfortable English for you guys. GERD JANSON But your English is pretty good, nonetheless. TOSHIO MATSUURA But I'm very spacey. So I hope you enjoy this time. Thank you. GERD JANSON So how would you describe what you're doing to someone who hasn't got a clue about music? TRANSLATOR He's visualizing dance music based on jazz. GERD JANSON Could you give us a brief definition or your definition of jazz music? TRANSLATOR It's always open-minded, and it can absorb everything. GERD JANSON So you would would say that different things can be Jazz? It's not only your normal John Coltrane record, but it could be also a modern club record in your opinion? TRANSLATOR Yes. It is correct. It is said hip-hop or house or techno, it is called like that in a record or CD shop, still he can feel it's close to him. He calls it jazz. GERD JANSON Back when you started out during the height of the whole acid jazz thing, the definition was a little more narrow, right? So maybe you could talk a little bit about that whole acid jazz scene from back in the day and how you got into that. TRANSLATOR The scene in 1980s in London, the people started to dance with jazz. It started in London in the ‘90s. It triggered him and he started to be interested in those kinds of music. The jazz called acid jazz was born from that movement. Through examining acid jazz, he discovered the source of acid jazz. Sometimes, it is soul and sometimes it is Latin music and so many other things. That's what he discovered. GERD JANSON If you're talking about London in the 80s, it's Gilles Peterson and Norman Jay at the Dingwalls club, did you fly to London back in those days to experience it firsthand or was it just something you experienced through the radio? TRANSLATOR He discovered the DJ guy named Paul Moppy who started to play jazz in a club, and he was really inspired with that. After that, he visited London in 1987, and around that time after acid music started and acid house was there as a big thing. Because of that club name was Acid House, the DJ named those kind of music as acid jazz. GERD JANSON Maybe you can play us an example of it? A song from that era or a track that was very influential to you? TOSHIO MATSUURA In the ‘80s? GERD JANSON Like a Dingwalls acid jazz classic? TOSHIO MATSUURA Let me check. (music: Har-You Percussion Group – “Welcome to the Party”) TOSHIO MATSUURA Only few clubs regularly DJ coming down play more pure music. Not really dance music but they'll just play, each by each favorite their music. After that, I go regularly to go to the club. A lot of influence from their playing. Originally, I love to go to the club to dance. Sometimes, I feel want to make. At that time, I met other two guys called Raphael and Yabe. We working together on the production. We made a production called UFO in 1990s. GERD JANSON TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah. We had a chance to make tune for compilation in Tokyo. That's why we started making. Before that, it's quite difficult to make music without notice and technique any instrument. At that time, we coming more, a lot of influence from hip-hop because they made from the record to make music. GERD JANSON Like sampling and all those techniques? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah. GERD JANSON Yeah. Do you have something with you from the early UFO days? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah. At first, maybe 95% of the sample. Just maybe only one piano or something that sucks on the instrument from live. Any other things all sample. It's 1990. (music: UFO – unknown) (music: James Brown – “Give it up or Turn it Loose (remix)”) The New York house. Also, Detroit hip-hop. Very separated, and people techno people just listen to techno. GERD JANSON And house people just listen to house. TOSHIO MATSUURA And hip-hop, the people, really young kids or [inaudible] or something like that, wear like ... The Basketball players or something like that. It's a little bit of a shame for me. If supporting the thing is fine, but uh ... [laughs] Looks like fashion. It's very horrible. I hate that. That reason why I wearing suit always because people hate that, wearing a suit, but I'm very comfortable. GERD JANSON You look good in a suit. TOSHIO MATSUURA Thank you. GERD JANSON You told me that you tried to be very eclectic when you DJ so it's not the stubbornness that you just described. TOSHIO MATSUURA Yes, because I don't want to get bored by myself. I can't play only one beat or one [inaudible], maybe one hour each if it's enough. I want to go more. Different way, always. GERD JANSON So there are people in Japan who like the eclectic side of things, right? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yes. Some people love that, but some people hate that. Play more of one genre, [people] ask me], but I want to make surprise and I want to make think, you know, sometimes educate to way to listening. For example, house or techno, behind the music is originally from jazz or soul or any other music, but the kids only listen to new stuff. GERD JANSON So you try to mix it all up? Old stuff, new stuff, different genres. TOSHIO MATSUURA Sometimes it works, but sometimes it makes chaos. It's quite risky. GERD JANSON In which places in Tokyo can you do that? Play that eclectic? Because you are affiliated with that Blue Note club, right? You're doing...? TOSHIO MATSUURA No, I don't like Blue Note club. GERD JANSON [laughs] Then I'm misinformed. TOSHIO MATSUURA Doesn't matter, you know the venue, from a small club to a very, very big venue, I want to play. Always. I'm very stupid I think. GERD JANSON No you're not. You did radio also, right? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah. GERD JANSON For a few years, or you are still doing it? Do you think that's the key or that's important in educating people with music to get the stubbornness out of it? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah, but you know my radio is not really big station, so the signal is very low. GERD JANSON Yeah. Which radio station is it? TOSHIO MATSUURA [inaudible] GERD JANSON Yeah. TOSHIO MATSUURA It's quite small. It's not like BBC or something like that. I just started through the net illegally. GERD JANSON Yeah. TOSHIO MATSUURA It worked. [People in] Brazil, from Africa, now regularly, the people through that can listen through the net [to] my stuff so it's good now. Quite important. Easy to understand what I feel, I think. GERD JANSON So the Internet is the savior of radio in our times? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah. GERD JANSON Yeah. Who are the people you work with? Like you mentioned Gilles Peterson Worldwide. Maybe you can talk a little bit about those connections like the worldwide jazz scene? There is a certain group of people right working with each other. TOSHIO MATSUURA I don't know since a few years maybe I'm so lucky ... connected people and communicated people, very spontaneous, so suddenly meet somewhere or someone introduce someone, someone send an email or, you know ... it now feels good to connect, you know ... I hope this time too, only one day but I'm feeling good today so... GERD JANSON So networking is important? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah, yeah. GERD JANSON And you're not only DJing at clubs right, you're also a music consultant for fashion shows and you’re also doing a few different things? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah. I make music this day sometimes promote the artist on the party and doing [inaudible] for Gilles and Tomato from the UK. They’re graphic people. I doing agent in Japan, so yeah. So many ways to survive, but only one thing I really enjoy those things now. GERD JANSON Just getting back to the acid jazz thing for a short time. What do you think were the reasons for it to disappear because the labels like acid jazz from Eddie Piller. They stopped that at one point right? The whole scene in London got a little bit dried out. You know what I mean? I mean, the reasons for acid jazz as a genre to disappear. It disappeared at one time or dried out. People were stopping making that kind of music, acid jazz. TOSHIO MATSUURA Maybe you feel it disappear but I don't feel any disappear. Label is gone, but I think scene is still there, but very difficult to find where it is but still the scene is there but the form is really changed since a long time. GERD JANSON Yeah that's what I meant like all those bands playing. TOSHIO MATSUURA After acid jazz, maybe become big like trip-hop or any other music, but still there is but quite difficult to find. GERD JANSON Yeah. Could you play something for us that has, in your opinion, still that vibe? TOSHIO MATSUURA The new stuff, you mean? GERD JANSON Yeah, what is done these days. (music: Ray – “Amp”) (music: Pharrell – “Can I Have it Like That (feat. Gwen Stefani)”) TOSHIO MATSUURA ... what is jazz, now but for me it's all completely different all three tracks but for me it's all jazz. GERD JANSON Because they have the same feeling? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah, so it's quite to difficult play same time, but try to fit a more natural [inaudible] and the people who listening to that, this tune and is most important. GERD JANSON To make it all work. TOSHIO MATSUURA Yes. Sometimes, I told you guys, sometimes it works, and people say, “Wow!” But sometimes the floor is gone. Quite risky. GERD JANSON I think that something everyone can relate to whoever played records at a party or at a club. This happens to everyone, I guess, sometimes you know? It's hard. I meant that it's not like his fault because if you're a DJ I think you have to find one that never had an experience like that yet. TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah but I feel very bad [laughs]. GERD JANSON Yeah, if any of you guys have any questions for Toshio. AUDIENCE MEMBER Have you played live with electronics and with other instruments or improvising with electronics live? TRANSLATOR Yes. TOSHIO MATSUURA You mean the DJ and the live band? AUDIENCE MEMBER Not DJ, but like with computer or equipment. TOSHIO MATSUURA You mean the PC and the live instrument? AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah. TOSHIO MATSUURA No. Just DJ with a band. AUDIENCE MEMBER [Speaker asks Toshio question in Japanese] TOSHIO MATSUURA That club owned by Shuya Okino. AUDIENCE MEMBER OK. Can you tell us about this club? TOSHIO MATSUURA The Room? AUDIENCE MEMBER You have no involvement with this club? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah, still going well since how long, maybe around 50 years? Very tiny club. Maybe 100 people, is packed. Still Shuya and Aruku always survive and try to make a nice vibe every time. Audience Member Hello, my name is Ana. My first question was just that...about the room, if you like to play there? But, then you like that. It's a nice club. It's a friend of mine, Shuya, and then I was wondering if you could name three of your favorite clubs in Tokyo and the third question was, do you like any artists from Sweden, and who? TOSHIO MATSUURA My favorite club called Yellow. Mainly house club, but sound system is very nice. DJ booth for DJ is really perfect. The environment is comfortable. The area is ... no one come inside, not too much request. The high booth, so if sometime go to outside of Tokyo, maybe Europe, somebody asking, talking a lot, it’s quite difficult, but that booth is very comfortable. Also, of course, The Room is very nice. Another one called Unit ... mainly live venue, but quite nice. Today, Tony Allen played there. Many more tech clubs now, but sometime ESG play. Sometime Four Tet, some [inaudible] musician plays. It's nice club. One more is club called Brew. We own the club. They’re gone five years ago, but is one of the best club in Tokyo, I think. My favorite artist in Sweden [is] Coop?. Maybe I'll [inaudible] next year. Yeah. GERD JANSON And what are your favorite artists from Japan right now? TOSHIO MATSUURA I just checked today in the plane, the band. Of course, people know the [inaudible], and Jazzy Sport, and any other artists maybe ... [inaudible], a band called Native. I got the CD last few days and quite nice. (music: Native – “Encyclopedia”) (music: Native – “4 Corners”) Jeff “Chairman” Mao Hi. Earlier, you played Har-You percussion, Har-You percussion track. What other songs from older jazz songs were influential to you? The early jazz dance songs you heard in the clubs... TOSHIO MATSUURA Quite difficult question, but... recently more modern jazz in the ‘60s and ‘70s, something like that, but still listen regularly Miles Davis Kind of Blue is my one of the best album. GERD JANSON [to audience member] You had a question right? AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah, it's ... when you played something earlier, you said that it was 95% samples. It was made in the ‘90s ... Earlier, you played a song and you said it was from the early 90s and it was 95% samples. Now, when you make music, is it samples or more live music? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah now it's more... less sample, because if you do sample, you have to pay more money. So that's the reason why more live. AUDIENCE MEMBER And more money? TOSHIO MATSUURA Because if take sample, have to pay to the original additions. AUDIENCE MEMBER But does it cost a lot to have the live musicians rather than a sample in it? TOSHIO MATSUURA Yeah, because if sample from James Brown, we have to pay a lot, but ask the musician, more cheaper. AUDIENCE MEMBER Hi, how you doing? Around what time did you find that your music started to become popular, worldwide,? Like, internationally? Around what time, throughout the ‘90s, with UFO, when did it first start to become popular internationally? TOSHIO MATSUURA Maybe in Australia, 1994. First time to come here, 1994, I think. I don't know when, some people very fast to know... Just really with first single in 1991, maybe after a few months in London, already sold a bootleg on vinyl. Maybe some people listen very fast. Of course, now it's can listen more easier, but in early ‘90s it's quite unusual that way. AUDIENCE MEMBER So it was mostly through releasing a 12-inch back then that you were able to spread the sound of UFO? It wasn't as much through like radio and through Gilles’ show? It was more by distributing 12-inches of your music? TOSHIO MATSUURA One by one is more stronger than any marketing, I believe. GERD JANSON Thank you. TOSHIO MATSUURA Thank you. GERD JANSON So maybe if there are no more questions we should end? TOSHIO MATSUURA I am happy. GERD JANSON With, one of your, maybe, all-time favorite jazz tunes? TOSHIO MATSUURA Sorry? GERD JANSON Maybe we should end the session by listening to one of your all-time favorite jazz tunes? It's always hard to pick those, I know. TOSHIO MATSUURA I don't bring all the stuff, but ...By my tune ... Just a second with CD ... Tune called “Loud Minority” changed my life. 200% changed my life. (music: UFO – “Loud Minority” / applause) Domo arigato.

Waajeed
In this talk, given at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, Waajeed of Platinum Pied Pipers looks back on Detroit’s incredible musical history, connecting the dots from Motown to the pioneers of techno, and on to the hip-hop scene he helped to establish. He explains the influence of the automotive industry on the city’s sound and of his father’s record collection on his own eclectic tastes. He also outlines his belief that artists have a responsibility beyond their music, recalls how being a DJ was the best way to escape the violence of the neighborhood he grew up in and why he owes his career to the “voice inside his head.”
Hosted by Toby Laing … Waajeed, and I’m sure that you all know who he is [applause]. He’s getting a lot of love around the world at the moment and he’s traveling the world as well, off the back of his project Platinum Pied Pipers. He’s been working for the past ten years on all kinds of underground music and we’re really lucky to have him here today, so cheers for coming by… Waajeed No problem… Wow, this technology… it’s really good. Toby Laing And thank you for last night’s set as well – that was very enjoyable… Waajeed Yo, I had fun. How many of y’all came out? Did anybody come out? [Applause] That’s good. [Points to audience] Before we do anything, I want to show some respect for my man Leon [Ware], there in the back… my fellow Detroiter… respect, brother [applause]. Without Leon, I wouldn’t be where I’m at now, so I need to say that, first and foremost. Toby Laing Well, that’s sort of how I want to start, and that’s history, really. Every place around the world has its own flavor, its own music, its own thing happening, but in the case of Detroit it goes a lot further than that. It’s a sound that people are feeling everywhere in the world and it’s influenced a lot of scenes around the world. Being from Detroit are you just too close to the source to realize that, or do you feel that yourself? Waajeed Being from Detroit, we’re not outside looking at the fish, we’re the fish looking at the outside. I think that keeps us kind of pure and honest, and for the most part musical integrity is first. It’s definitely a huge blessing for me to be from the D. It’s everything that I am. Toby Laing You were feeling that history there all the time, from childhood onwards? Waajeed Always, always, always. I find that in a lot of ways, even subconsciously, we’re always trying to re-live that history of the Motown era and everything that went off really well in Detroit and then essentially, overnight, just left us. In a lot of ways, we’re all just working to make that happen again. Toby Laing So, when Motown did blow up, they were drawing on the talent that was there in abundance. And it’s still there in abundance. It doesn’t matter if it’s techno or soul and hip-hop, it’s drawing on a long tradition and there’s a continuity there. Waajeed Definitely, and being from the Midwest, in general, there’s a certain kind of working-class mentality that comes with everything that we do, whether we decide to be tap-dancers, we work from nine to five continuously, hardcore, to be the best tap-dancer. In the same way as my parents worked in the plants, they worked from nine to five almost like a machine. So, a lot of times you hear music that reflects that machine type of thing. That’s just who we are. Toby Laing That’s interesting, that clock-punching, hypnotic activity can come through in the music just through being the dominant experience in society. Waajeed I think guys like Derrick May, Juan Atkins, they really took note of that pulsing rhythm and, in turn, their music reflected it. In terms of hip-hop, cats like Dilla, or myself or Dwele, we call it the “Detroit hump,” that pulsating rhythm. Toby Laing The Detroit hump? Waajeed I’m going to copyright that word. Toby Laing I suppose I should go back a bit. What was your first experience with music when you were growing up, and could you have guessed then that you’d be involved with it yourself? Waajeed: Some of my earliest memories of music was my dad playing music late at night. He’s going to read this, but he doesn’t really know. He used to smoke the substance. [laughter] Whoo, Dad’s going to be mad. It was late at night, and I remember being around – I had to be about eight or nine – and the den was right next to my bedroom. I’d hear the music and get up and see the smoke. Our stereo system had an illuminated blue light, and I could see the silhouette and the smoke and hear all these crazy sounds. He used to listen to Coltrane, Kraftwerk, he used to listen to Roger and Zapp, Parliament, all those crazy-ass voices. I didn’t know what the hell that shit was. And little did I know I was getting a second-hand high. I could just remember hours sitting there and watching him enjoying this music that I had no clue what the hell it was or what they were talking about or why they had these crazy-ass voices in it. Those were my earliest memories of music. Just now as, as adult, I’m coming to understand that… Toby Laing That your dad was on some real hip shit there… Waajeed That my dad was [coughs] smoking marijuana. Toby Laing Yes, we can’t confirm or deny that… so, he was listening to Kraftwerk – well, that’s cool, man, and Coltrane, of course, is the coolest… Waajeed I remember a Kraftwerk 45 being in my house, and he used to listen to the B-52s a lot, too… Toby Laing Well, that would be why you’re well-versed in all kinds of different music… Waajeed I didn’t know. I never really had a clue until I started back to DJing. I started as a DJ when I was about 14, just by inheriting my dad’s record collection, and then over the last five years I’ve been immersing myself back in the DJ culture. You know, you’d do a party and hip-hop cats played hip-hop music all night or house cats played house music all night, and here I am… I want to play all of it, so they’re looking at me like, “What the fuck are you doing?” In my head, it’s all the same. I can just see the good or bad, so here lies my battle with music today. Toby Laing That sounds great. When I was looking back at some interviews that you’ve done, you do get a little bit impatient with people if they try to label the music that you make now. Waajeed Lord have mercy. It’s really a pain in the ass. I make it my job to make music and to never be in judgment, or to really label it. You don’t go to the museum and see a Van Gogh piece and right next to it is Van Gogh describing exactly what that piece was. That’s stupid. People have to apply their own life stories on your music or what it may mean for them, and I think that enough artists just dumb it up. After you see a great film, you don’t see something that explains every line of the story and everything that happened. I think that’s silly. So, for me, I just really try to make sure that I never label what I do or put that definition on it, because I want people to apply their own definitions of what they get from it. Toby Laing And I suppose that when you’re working in the studio, your influences and what you’ve heard in the past are working subconsciously on the product, so you’re not making something for a market… it’s not commercial music, as such, so it’s a different process again. Waajeed It’s all a big mash-up in my head. And in my head it’s all, directly or indirectly, like soul music, because it touches people’s souls – and it doesn’t have to have a Rhodes or, “well, Sir, you know…” for it to be soul. It could be techno – some of the stuff my man was playing earlier on today was nuts, and it’s soulful… I could go on and on about these press bastards. I’ve learned a lot about the press, man – unless there’s any press people here, hi [laughter]… – like they come and they sit down with you to create a story, so whether that be about Baatin being homeless or crazy, or Jay Dee or Sa-Ra or whoever, they have it in their head that they want a story, so I just try to duck and dive. I’ve learned that less is more. Toby Laing So, making the music is one thing, but having to take it out into the marketplace and promote your music, it’s a whole other [thing]... Waajeed [Exhales] I was talking about that earlier. I just think with today’s climate and the way things are happening globally, we don’t have any real leadership. Because music is raising so many people’s children, musicians have to have a certain responsibility, whether we want it or not. And we’re kind of like torchbearers for our experience, whatever that experience would be, whether it’s a school experience or whether you got shot nine times, or you hustled crack in the street. There’s a certain amount of responsibility that we have, because no one else is stepping up to do it. Look at Bush, he’s a fucking jerk. [applause] He’s not a leader for anybody. I would much rather look at 50 Cent – he’s a lot more interesting than fucking Bush. Toby Laing Street wisdom is better than no wisdom at all. Waajeed That’s real, that’s real. So with this responsibility, we’re not just in the studio any more, where we punch out these beats like were recluses. We’re forced to step out and have these opinions. I don’t know why so many people are wiling out about Kanye West saying George Bush doesn’t care about black people. Toby Laing I think maybe it’s because he didn’t include all the other non-whites in America. Waajeed Maybe that, but in general we need people like Kanye West to say stuff like that because nobody else is saying it. We don’t have the appropriate leadership that gets out there and says those things, whether we all want to say them or we don’t agree with them. But there’s definitely a huge responsibility that comes with making music. It’s part of the job. If you ask me, I wouldn’t be shaking hands and kissing babies, I’d rather make music. You don’t like it, take it or leave it; if you like it, great; if you don’t, who gives a dog’s ass? That’s my preference as an artist. But as an artist I have a responsibility to get out and make change. Toby Laing Your music is conveying a lot. You started DJing when you were 14. How did it go? Were you performing at that age, or were you just collecting and getting yourself together…? Waajeed: I need to say why I decided to become a DJ first. In my neighborhood in the east side of Detroit – I’m sure Leon [Ware], sitting in the audience knows what I’m talking about when I say east side of Detroit – dangerous, dumb dangerous. I’m a ’70s kid, the time in the ’80s and the Reagan era, Reaganomics, shit was real in the street. This was when people were shooting each other in the street and their body would be laying out and kids would take their sneakers off. Kids were shooting each other for sneakers. Crazy shit. The musicians always had a pass to get through the hood. If you see a kid with a bunch of records, you ain’t going to rob him for a bunch of records, as opposed to a kid with new Top Ten Adidas on and robbing him for his sneakers. This was a part of the reason, these kids are getting robbed and these kids aren’t getting robbed. That was part of the reason, if you could sing or rap or dance that gave you your pass to get through the ’hood. That was part of the reason why I started DJing, just so I could get through the ’hood freely. I could have my little Starter coat on or my little Adidas, and some records in my hand, and they wouldn’t mess with me. I wouldn’t get beat up and dragged into some abandoned house for my jacket. I just happened to hook up with a bunch of other weirdo kids in the neighborhood who did the same and just happened to slip through the cracks in the ’hood, and right now those kids are known as Slum Village. That was when I was about 14. This was about the time, about ’84, when crack hit the streets and it was wild, wild, wild. Toby Laing Even though I’ve heard stories like this, it’s something I can’t really comprehend, actually. I’ve been to Detroit and downtown is undergoing some kind of renaissance; it’s all coming back. But there are still not many people around the streets and there are still a lot of deserted buildings. It’s a very tough environment and even if you hear stories about it, I don’t think you can understand it unless you were actually there. Waajeed I call Detroit beautiful ugly, if that makes any sense. There’s a beauty and there’s darkness. There’s a beauty in the fact that it is a violent city. It’s just a micro to macro. Toby Laing So, the culture has a positive effect on people in some ways? Waajeed Absolutely. Just like hip-hop was created from New York in dire circumstances, and these dire circumstances make people look inward and pull something out that may not have been pulled out otherwise. Like, a girl could be having an argument with her boyfriend and be pissed and get on the keyboard and make something bananas. I guess there’s just something in people that makes people go and just punch those frustrations out, whether it be on a keyboard or on people. Toby Laing That’s something that seems to be the case. A tough environment can result in some amazing culture. It seems to be something that people from your part of the world are very proud of and there’s a strong identity coming through. But as you got older, through your school years, when did you start thinking about production? Was it just through hooking up with your mates? Waajeed I think production and music-making was the last thing I was thinking about, realistically. As a DJ, I was such a big fan, I just wanted the record, I just wanted the vinyl. I wanted to listen to it, I wanted to flip the cover back and forth, read the credits, know who was in those credits. I was just a fan for the music, not actually thinking about the process and what it takes to make the music, but as a DJ I just loved the record and loved listening to it. That definitely started to change when I spent more time with Dilla, Jay Dee. Toby Laing There’s a group that I’ve heard about called The Breakfast Club but I don’t know the details … Waajeed That was Dwele and his homeboys and they were on the opposing side of town, the west side of Detroit. So, whenever we’d hear something by them we’d go, “Nah, they’re turkeys, man. Their shit is wack,” knowing it was fresh. But we’d just front, “Get that garbage off.” But it was all one family, so it kinda worked itself out. Toby Laing A friendly rivalry there. Waajeed I think there’s always a rivalry. Even in these studios, I’ve just been here two days, it’s about to get real real. The competitive nature of people is going to start coming out. But that’s a good thing, as long as your intent is good. Hopefully, nobody’s hoping that somebody spills a Red Bull in their keyboard and the whole keyboard blows up. As long as the intent is good, it’s a good look for music as a whole. Everybody benefits from good music because it raises the bar and if the bar’s raised, everybody’s bringing the bar higher up. I think that’s reflected more in underground stuff than commercial stuff these days. Toby Laing So, you’re sharing but it’s competitive at the same time. And the MPC is perfect for that, right? Because you can make something on an MPC and walk away and someone can come in when you’re not in the room and change it. Has that ever happened to you? Waajeed Yeah, that’s happened to me, man. It turned out to be somebody’s single and I didn’t get credit for it. But I won’t talk about that. Toby Laing And that’s just all part of it isn’t it… the creative cycles… So DJing and working behind the scenes and production – that was the next step, production, after DJing… There’s actually another question I want to ask about [the Detroit spoken-word and open-mic-night venue] Cafe Mahogany. Was that something that was important? Waajeed Yeah, it was important to a lot of people for a lot of different reasons. This was about the time after Love Jones had come out. Y’all remember that corny-ass movie, right? Toby Laing … There’s something about a spoken-word poetry thing … there’s a lot of humor in there and it’s about entertaining the crowd, as much as anything, and it’s about cheeky jokes… Waajeed And getting girls. That was another level of importance… all my homeboys would go there and they would write these little corny-ass poems and then just try to get girls, with no real intent towards poetry. You know what I’m saying, this is an art form, man – don’t just try to use it to get girls. So, yeah, that’s the relevance of Cafe Mahogany. Toby Laing Just looking at it, you’ve got the label Bling 47 and there must be some humor in that name, and then there’s Platinum Pied Pipers, there’s some humor in that name. And listening to the album, that’s the thing that shines through – it’s a banging album, it’s a club album, but there’s humor in there too [inaudible]… Waajeed Yeah, that was terrible. He said that every remix of [Jay-Z’s] Black Album was wack. I won’t go into that but the sarcasm, in general… you’ll notice that a lot of people in this industry, they just take themselves too serious. You know, they’re in a dark club with sunglasses on, trying to look cool with the fur and the chain. I’ve seen too much of that in my life and I’m just totally irritated by it. Detroit is probably one of the most honest, working-class cities in the Midwest, outside of St Louis, and when out-of-towners come like that into our city, they’re just going to get robbed, period. They’re setting themselves up to be robbed. When I see that, I just think, “This is some fucking buffoonery going on.” I mean, there’s nothing wrong with sunglasses – I’ve got some right here – but there’s a certain point that we get to where I’m like, “Man, that’s not cool, B. That shit is wack.” With that in mind, I just don’t take this as serious as a lot of other cats; the business side, that is – the music I take as serious as my life, the opportunities I take seriously, but as far as the frontin’ and the postin’, I really just don’t fuck with that, man. I steer clear of it. If I see cats acting like that, I go in the other direction. I don’t want no part of that, man. Toby Laing For the reason that it’s restrictive to creativity as well? Waajeed Yeah, man, that’s when you’re dealing with sales, not integrity, and I just want to make sure that at the end of the day I can look at myself in the mirror and have some respect for what I’ve done and what I’ve created and know that my records are not contributing to the genocide of my people… I just stay so far away from that that when I name my groups or projects, my sarcasm for that kind of energy is just playing it. Like Bling 47, that’s hilarious – you know what I’m saying? I ain’t got no damned diamonds on and I probably won’t be rocking no diamonds [whispers] probably… But, generally, like Platinum Pied Pipers was just us clowning ourselves, like, “What are cats going to be wearing after platinum? OK, let’s name ourselves the Platinum Pied Pipers!” So it’s mocking a lot of the stuff that’s happening, in my opinion, with mainstream records. That shit is buffoonery. Toby Laing But are you finding that trying to and succeeding in staying away from cliches of mainstream music, taking an alternate route, you’re still getting a lot of recognition… is it going further than you thought it would go, or did you have a good feeling that you had the support already…? Waajeed Yeah, it’s definitely going a lot further than I imagined. I know a lot of people weren’t raised the way I was raised, with regards to this wide array of musical choices, and that’s the reason I had reservations for doing this last Platinum Pied Pipers album the way that I did. Initially, I thought that in order to be in the game, you’ve got to play the game on your own terms… Doing what I’m doing is almost walking a fine line, almost like being Robin Hood – like I’ll produce a track for an artist that’s a big name and go into Sony Music and get this huge check, and then take all of that money and make underground records and put underground records out… that’s the stuff that helped me get to where I’m at now. It’s walking a fine line, like I might put some funny-ass name on it – I’m not going to say no names, because you might go out and research the records, but creating these aliases and putting the records out, nobody knows I even made that record, so when I’m in a club or go to a Kanye West listening party, all those dudes be looking at me like “Corny-ass nigga, man… underground records, blah, blah, blah…” I’m just thinking, like, “B, I made some records that you love, and you don’t even know.” But, that’s the beauty of it; it’s just like having a secret that nobody else knows. It’s like going to a club with a pistol in your jacket – you ain’t wilin’ out, but you just know that if anything gets crazy, you could just get out of that joint if you needed to… [Sighs] That’s a bad analogy [laughs]; that’s terrible, but that’s the idea. Or like being a kung-fu master or something… Toby Laing Yeah, that’s better… Waajeed You just know that if anyone comes up with some stuff, you could just chop them down, so that’s part of the power of silence. Tony Laing So, it’s like being invisible at times? Waajeed Man, I think that’s the best way, to be honest with you. Being invisible… it’s like being a photographer, in a lot of ways. You can get the best shots if nobody even knows that you’re there. If you’re in a room and you’re quiet and nobody knows you’re there, you can just stay there and you can suck up so much information… there’s a certain beauty in being quiet and laying low and being patient. I’ve been patient for a long time. Toby Laing Yes, I’m thinking the last ten years or so… how long have you been producing? Waajeed Realistically, I haven’t been producing that long… I started experimenting when I was about 17 and then I got into the arts. I got a full scholarship, oddly enough to design cars. Crazy, right? I was going to be an automotive engineer. I was going to be the guy who designed the next Ford car. Can you imagine that? Me talking this shit in a board room? But yeah, I was supposed to go to school on this full scholarship to design cars, and I was being looked at by GM and Ford and all these guys and they were setting me up to be this great car designer and other stuff, and my homeboys had just struck a record deal and it was like, “Yo B, we gonna go to Europe, man – so, are you gonna stay in school, or are you gonna roll with us to Europe?” What was I supposed to do? This was like, “Peace!” I left school, man, I was out. My parents was looking at me like, “What the hell you doin’? This is going to set you up, you’re going to have a good career after you get out of school, being an automotive designer.” I don’t know, man, I just went with my heart and I left school, traveled with Slum Village for about three years on and off. I just remember that we were in Europe one time and we were running to get the train and there was just this big glow of light… it just happened and it was like, “Yo, this is what you’re supposed to be doing, this is your future, this is your destiny.” And I was like, man, I don’t really want this, but here I am. Toby Laing So, you could see the hard work ahead… Waajeed I didn’t know it was this much hard work. I think, for a large part, this is just part of being independent and putting out the type of records that you want to put out and having to support yourself. It’s not an easy task. A lot of people think they can just create a label… how many people don’t have labels these days? But how many of those people are active in the label and effective as far as the global community of music? It’s not a cakewalk at all. Are we getting off the subject man? I’m sorry, I’m all over the place. Toby Laing No, it’s all good. So, you went to Europe for a long time, on and off, with Slum Village. Waajeed Yeah, we traveled with Tribe, we traveled with a bunch of people. I got an inside scoop about how the business works, a lot of friends I made were based on, “It’s cool to hang out with you,” not “I’m a musician or producer or a beat-maker,” or whatever. Toby Laing So, how would you describe your role in those three years? Waajeed I wish you wouldn’t do that, man. My role was I was the guy who got the girls [laughter]. I’m just going to lay it out… we’re intimate, we’re personal, we’re friends. I was the guy that got the
girls. While they were working hard on stage, I’d go up and say, “Hey, so and so would really like to meet you, we’re having a party at the hotel and badabing, bam!” That was my job [applause]. I’m not saying I was the most effective at it, I didn’t say I was the greatest guy for the job a lot of times, but that was my job. Toby Laing Just chemistry; that was your job. Waajeed Shaking hands, kissing babies. I’m sorry… So, after being on the road and getting back, being around music in this way, going to the studio, hanging out, all that stuff, I got a perspective on what it’s about. The long hours and how you’ve got to put so much into it just for 1% of the population of the world to even care. That’s how it really all kinda started, and that was about ’99. My dad always told me, “If you want to be really, really good at something, if you want to be great, lock yourself in your room and do that thing for one year.” And that’s what I did. I took my MPC and all these records that I’d collected all these years. I knew what every break was because I was a DJ. I knew like Paul McCartney or The Beatles, I knew records like the back of my hand, and I locked myself in my apartment for a year. It started kinda as a dare. Jay Dee had this beat machine laying in his basement, and Questlove from The Roots had broken the beat machine. He’d got some disc tangled up in it, I don’t know. But it started as a dare: “Yo, if you can get that disc out of there you can take this machine home and use it.” So I took it as a challenge. Great, OK, I got the disc out and he was, “Great, take it home.” So I took it home for a weekend, no manual or anything, just based on, “OK, I’m going to make this thing work.” So I made four tracks and left a message on Jay Dee’s voicemail,
saying, “This is what I did, I know it’s kind of wack but, yo, just check it.” So I played them on his answering machine and he called me back immediately. “What was that?” I was, “That’s just something I was messing around with.” He was, like, “That’s pretty good, man. Play it again.” I was thinking, “I might have something here, let me re-evaluate this.” So, after that I had the encouragement from my crew – like, “Yo, you could really do some things with this” – and I locked myself in my apartment for a year. No, I’m telling you man, I had a damned woolly lumberjack beard. It was wild. I locked myself in my apartment for a year, chopping up records every day. My schedule would be getting up late afternoon because I’d always be up late at night, into the morning. So, I’d say, “You knock out two beats and you can get a glass of water.” For real. I’d have this military voice in my ear telling me to knock out these two beats so I could get a glass of water. I’d be thirsty, thinking, “Damn man, I’ve got to knock out these beats fast.” So I’d knock out two tracks and, before I could get up, the voice would say, “OK, make another one, then you can get a glass of water.” Toby Laing The voice of dehydration. Waajeed Make another beat, then I’d get the glass of water. “Ah this water’s really great.” Then the voice would go, “Make three more, then you can get another glass of water.” It was getting so ridiculous, like, if I had to use the restroom, the voice would say, “Make three beats and then you can go to the restroom.” I’d be like this… [bounces up and down on the sofa]. Toby Laing You’d be making some uptight beats? Waajeed Crazy, man. Crazy. This little voice in my head, saying, “Before you use the restroom you’ve got to make three joints… Don’t even talk about eating.” That’s why I’m so damned skinny. The voice would say, “Before you can get some food, you’ve got to make four joints, or at least chop some drums up.” And I lived that way for a year, with just volumes and volumes and volumes of tracks. Toby Laing Do you still draw on that material to this day? Waajeed I was so pure then, I still revel in those moments. It was just me and those records; no phone, no politics, no magazine covers, no talking to my agent, no talking to my manager, no tour, none of that shit. For a lot of y’all, these are your best moments, so revel in them. This is when you’re pure, these moments are when you’re going to determine your intent for the rest of your career, or how you’re going to be for the rest of your career, and who you’re going to be for the rest of your career. So I hope a lot of you have got that crazy-ass voice in your head telling you to make nine tracks before the day’s over. But, yeah, those moments, I still look back on them. To some degree, I wish I could be back in that place. Toby Laing Since that time you’re still working in the studio a lot and I know you’ve got a lot of projects scheduled for the future, too. Waajeed I’ve still got that crazy-ass voice in my head, telling me a lot of things that I need to be doing. I’ve just started, my first record came out in 2002, which wasn’t that long ago… feels like yesterday. Luckily, it was a major release, so it allowed me to do some ghost production and live off that money and do the bohemian thing I’m doing now. It allowed me a lot of space to be more creative and for me to just do what the hell I want to do. Toby Laing But how has it changed now, from the days when you were just in your apartment with the MPC or whatever you were using, making your tunes? Now you’re collaborating with a lot of different artists, so they must come around and work with you… how has your process developed from that point? Is it still based around the MPC? Waajeed For the most part, yeah, but the process has changed a lot because there are just so many people involved and there are just so many people that rely on me now. It was just me back then, but now the responsibility level has tripled – responsibility to my artists, responsibility to my family, responsibility to my upbringing. I could be in the club and hear a joint that I love and I just want to wile out, but there’s a camera in there and I can’t be wilin’ out and my family’s looking at me. I’m carrying this responsibility of a community of people on my back and – more important than doing what I want to do sometimes – it’s more important to reflect those people in a proper light and to be the person that’s carrying their cross. I’ve got hundreds of homeboys who made way better beats than I got now – or made way better music or made better decisions, or were smarter people – that are dead in the street now, that have been shot and killed. They would want to be in this position now… so [I have responsibilities] that are not based on what I want to do or how I feel… Toby Laing Well, it’s back to representing a tradition… drawing on a tradition. I can definitely respect that. Waajeed Yeah, for this PPP album, there was no profanity on there, no one talking about killing nobody’s grandma. Dilla was the only person talking about rims, but you know, I’ll give him that space to do that. But for the most part, I just didn’t want to create a record that supported all those do-rag stereotypes of black people. Which, in their own right, if that’s what you do, then that’s good look, but there’s not enough people that are not representing that, so I want to put a little paint where it ain’t. But that’s not to say that when I’m in my crib I won’t have a do-rag on or that when you meet me in person, I won’t be cussing and so on. It’s just that there’s a certain responsibility of the cross that you have to bear when you’re in a public situation – particularly the media, because if y’all don’t know, the media is a monster… they can help you build your empire or they can destroy you. Toby Laing In the studio, if you’re writing a song, what’s the process? Is it different every time? Are you drawing on beats that you’ve made or working with the vocalist first, or doing it all at once? Waajeed It really all depends. Sometimes you’ve just got that mood and it needs to be you alone in the studio. Or you might meet somebody who you love what they do and you need to collaborate. Not to be corny, but it starts with the vibe. If you can’t get along with someone, then there’s a good chance that you’re not going to make good music together because music is intimate. So, it all depends. For me, I’ve been lucky enough to have most of my projects revolve around me, so it’s usually just me in the studio. Toby Laing It’s a good time to mention your collaborator, Saadiq, in Platinum Pied Pipers. He seems to be a very strong influence on that album. Waajeed: Not really [laughs]. Toby Laing But as an instrumentalist, and you’re talking about creating a vibe in the studio, that’s where the vibe is happening, between those two sides of the spectrum, the production and the musician side… Waajeed Yes and no. For the sake of the group, Saadiq is the guy that does the show. I like to say I produce the album, he produces the show. He can play so many different instruments, he can dance, he looks like Tupac, on the visual side it’s a good look. He can handle that, dog. But I’m a jerk in the studio, I’m a total jerk. You heard it from my own mouth, I’m a control freak. “It’s not going to leave this studio unless that snare is right. It’s not going to leave the studio unless the sound that you hear on the left side of the speaker on the last verse just before the cymbal comes in is right.” I’m real anal about that. I always get into it with everyone I’m working with. Toby Laing So, you’ve scared everyone out of your studio? Waajeed: Man, I’m a jerk. And so you should be because this is your statement to the world. If people are going to judge you based on a track that they hear, then you need to be involved in that judgement process. [Addresses audience] This is the same for you. Don’t take a backseat because you’re running out of studio time, or you don’t want to get in an argument with that person. Yo man, make it known, if you think this is the best thing for the track and you can defend your judgement, make it happen, for real. I would much rather be respected than be the friend of thousands of people. Toby Laing But that would have to be the point of view of the producer, not the collaborator, because that’s terrible if you’ve got a collaborator who’s [like that]. Waajeed Absolutely, absolutely. If I’m in a situation where I’m working with other people, I take the back seat or the front, or whatever position needs to be played, but if you are producing an album and it’s going to have your name on it, saying “produced by blah, blah, blah,” you’ve got to put your foot in it, treat it like it’s your last opportunity, go hard, otherwise… There are just some things you can’t take the back seat to in this process of being a musician or a producer… that’s not something you can take a loss for. I know some of y’all know exactly what I’m talking about, because you’re going to be arguing about it by the end of this Red Bull Music Academy, about your music… Toby Laing Not too much, of course – the main thing is cooperation. Waajeed: I’m with that. Toby Laing So was it a natural thing to take the Platinum Pied Pipers project to the stage, or was it something that was hard work? Was it complicated? Waajeed It was definitely part of the process from the beginning. It started just out of frustration. I’ve seen hip-hop guys and just performers in general… every two minutes of the show they’re saying, “Say ho-oooh!” These people pay to come see you perform and the performer’s asking the audience to perform? That’s crazy [applause]. Isn’t that crazy? So – as opposed to being one of those groups where the MC just walks up and down the stage holding his nuts all night and there’s like 90 of his homeboys on the stage saying “Represent, represent, keep it real son” – I was like, out of frustration, “Yo, we cannot be like that.” I remember saying to Saadiq that I would rather wear a blazer and a bowtie than look like that, and that’s where it started… The performance value is just as relevant as an album these days, because if you don’t have a good show to balance the music, how will people even know that it’s good? People are more likely to talk about what they’ve seen than what they’ve heard… if you get in the show and you kill it, they just support one another, they have to… what you do and what you say has to support the music. Toby Laing So what role does improvisation have to play in your live show? Is there a place for that? Waajeed Definitely. As much as I owe to being able to play the keyboards, at heart I’m an MPC producer. That’s what I do for the most part. And the part of our show that allows space for that is that we have this freestyle thing, and I just make something up right there on the stage. There’s room for it, definitely. There has to be, just to keep it alive, I guess. Toby Laing So, how do you find it – you’ve created this music and your translated it onto the stage and you’re performing it around the world, around Europe… Waajeed It’s wild, man. Toby Laing Have you taken it to Japan yet? Waajeed Not yet, we’re going to do a tour next year of Japan and Australia. Toby Laing So, the group is traveling a lot… Waajeed Too much… Toby Laing Too much for what? Waajeed I mean, I’m a producer. I’m not a performer, really. It’s part of it, but I’ve turned so much work down this year because I’m out on the road and that’s tough for me. In retrospect, looking back, I’m like, ”I should be in the studio,” because that’s my voice; my voice is in the studio. Toby Laing Well, I know that there are people around the world who do appreciate you getting out there and taking the show around the world… Waajeed I don’t mind doing it, but it is a process on your creativity. You could be up there playing a song and thinking, “I could take the chord progression and change it,” and then you’re like, “Oh shit, I’m standing in front of a thousand people.” In your head, part of the creative process is always just running and it’s ramping up, but you have to pacify it because you’ve got 100 interviews to do. Toby Laing That’s what I was wondering… does the music change from country to country; does the inspiration of a different place have a bearing on the performance? It must do. But is there a strong flavor of being on the road bringing the group closer together? Waajeed It definitely brings the group closer together. If you have a person who can ride out a tour with you, they can ride out anything with you. I’m just so grateful. I’m sitting up here, but there are hundreds of people who are responsible for me being here and I’m nothing without them, and probably vice-versa. That’s the other thing, man. You just got to have a good team. Nobody can do this by themselves. You have to have a good squad; a dedicated group of people who that are looking for the benefit of the team and not just so much personally. I’m lucky. Even just moving to New York, I managed to find a good team of people who care about the benefit of music as a whole, like Spinna, Bobbito, Rich Medina. In a sense, these people have given me a job, you know… they play the music. People don’t give the DJ enough credit these days – you’ve got DJs out here breaking records. [Phone rings in audience] You were supposed to turn that off [laughs]… Toby Laing So, you moved to New York – that was right in the middle of the album process, was it? Waajeed Yeah. Toby Laing So, you had to… give it a break and come back to it to finish it in your new home… Waajeed Yeah, in my new home. I moved from Detroit to New York about two years ago. Every decision I’ve ever made has been based on my experiences with my close personal confidants in the music business and one thing I learned is that you can scream at the top of your lungs, but if no one is there to listen, no one will hear you. That’s kinda the point that I reached in Detroit. Being born and raised there, everyone knew who I was and it was just like looking to be recognized by people that felt like they know you. You know what I’m saying, “Aw, you ain’t Waajeed, you Robert O’Bryant…” So, the idea of moving to New York was to move somewhere fresh, somewhere where there was no ceiling, where it’s infinite and you can just keep on going up… Toby Laing And you’re now quite close to that dangerous record industry, though… Waajeed Wow, yeah, I’m definitely in the belly of the beast, but there’s definitely good things to the belly of the beast, because it makes you really realize, internally, your purpose, why you are here and why you are supposed to do what you’re supposed to do and who you’re supposed to involve with all that. And it was tough, man. I had a really nice loft in Detroit, two levels – it was fresh because the cost of living is fairly low. Toby Laing And now you’ve got the shoebox? Waajeed Listen man, I moved to Crown Heights in New York City. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of Buckshot Shorty, when he talks about Crown Heights in his records… there were so many damn roaches in that apartment, man, that they couldn’t be in the wall any more, because they’d be fighting for space in there, so they just be walking… You’d be watching television and three would just come across the television. It was crazy, man. Toby Laing So, are they looking after the place now? Waajeed No, this was the first place that I moved into, just before I finished the Platinum Pied Pipers album. Those early credits that I used for the studio, I used “Joe’s Apartment” in reference to this roach-filled apartment I was in. But we went on tour and I came back and I was Just like “I can’t be living here; this is not a good look.” So, I moved from the roach motel. Toby Laing I’m glad to hear that. Waajeed Me too. Toby Laing So, your new base of operations is in New York and you’ve got some new projects that you’ve been talking about a bit lately in the dreaded media. What is your idea for the next couple of years and what do you want to achieve. Waajeed I just want to stay creative. I just want to be able to do what I feel from my spirit. I just want to be able to make the type of music that just keeps going up – as opposed to finding this niche where you can make a gazillion dollars and just keep repeating the same process, I just want to keep going up. I mean, I don’t know what I’m going to be making next year; I just want to keep making progressive music that makes people think and, most of all, that enlightens people. That’s what I want to do, so there are a couple of things coming up, both major [and independent]. I’m more interested in the independent stuff, because that stuff has less boundaries… Toby Laing So, Waajeed & The Jazz Katz… what’s the deal with them? Waajeed Umm… you know you always meet these old-school cats and they’re real cool – they’ve got a little cigarette hanging out their mouth, sunglasses… you know what I’m sayin’… so I thought it would be cool to start a group that had that kind of energy to it… Toby Laing We could keep going, but I get the feeling that people want to ask some questions in the audience. Is that true? [Inaudible comments from audience] Or we could listen to some music… It’s time for music. Waajeed What do you want to hear, man? [Inaudible shouts from audience] I knew you were going to ask me that, man. I’m not going to play that. I need
to say this: I hate playing my own music. I hate it. I’m such a control freak and I think, “Oh, that snare could’ve been up a little louder.” It’s painful for me to play my own music. When I DJ, I never play my own music and that’s why. I’m going to stop bitching and play a song… [music: Waajeed – unknown / applause] Waajeed I’m going to go through this CD and see what else is in here. I’m not really sure what’s in here but we’ll all find out together. Oh yeah. This is a remix. Where’s that guy… Enrico’s friend? [Inaudible comment from audience] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did this remix for what’s it called? [Inaudible comment from audience] Yeah, Domu. What’s it called, Archive Records? I need to find out when this is
coming out ’cause I want to get this. [Inaudible comment from audience] Please do. It has my girl Tiombe Lockhart on it, so it’s a little out-the-box. Check it out. [music: Domu – “It’s You” Platinum Pied Piers Remix / applause] Waajeed Alright, I’ll play a couple more tracks, then if you’ve got some questions. Anybody got
any requests out there? There’s all these bootleg MP3s floating around of my music, you probably know my music better than me. [Inaudible comment from audience] Oh, no. I’m not playing that stuff. You’ve got internet thieves in the air, so they just might take the music out of the air. [Inaudible comment from audience] Yeah, I have that. [Inaudible comment from audience] No, I don’t have that. I asked for requests and I don’t even have what you requested. Let me see what I’ve got. What was it you wanted? [Inaudible comment from audience] Oh, the Roy Ayers. I’d like to play that. [Flicks through CD] This is something I did for Jean Grae, a Herbaliser remix. [music: Herbaliser feat. Jean Grae – “Nah’mean Nah’m Sayin’” Platinum Pied Pipers Remix / applause] Waajeed I don’t know when that record is coming out, but it’s a Ninja Tune release so it should be soon – the sooner the better. I did this remix for Roy Ayers and I really had fun doing it. I think it’s out this month on BBE. The name of the track is called “Funk In The Hole.” Check it out. [music: Roy Ayers – “Funk In The Hole” Platinum Pied Pipers Remix / applause] Waajeed Yeah, I like that. Alright, so I’m going to play – what is it? The Samy Deluxe joint. I worked with these cats – I think it was about 2003, Hamburg, Germany. I didn’t even know hip-hop was going down in Germany, I had no clue. And these dudes heard this beat CD of mine and it was, “Yo, we want to work with you.” OK, I didn’t even know these dudes were superstars. I had no clue. They showed up at my loft, we got down. I think we did about six tracks and they rhymed in German the whole time. I didn’t understand a single word they were saying, but I knew it was fly because of the patterns, you could understand the patterns. It’s probably one of the best work relationships I’ve got, or had. I still kick it with these dudes. I’ll play you some of that stuff. It’s in German, so you might not understand what they’re saying, but neither did I. Let’s play this one. [music: Samy Deluxe – unknown / applause] Waajeed This is a single they put out. [music: Sammy Deluxe - unknown / applause) Waajeed I’m going to beat you all in the head. Toby Laing Just in your travels, you’ve obviously checked out music scenes around the world. Is there anything really exciting you that you want to mention in other parts of the world, something that influences you or is worth checking out? Waajeed I’m really excited about the grime scene in the UK. I’m really excited by it. To some degree I relate it to hip-hop, just what it’s being created out of and what it’s being created for. I really hope that the people involved in the grime scene in the UK do something relevant with it, use it as a way to make change, and not just to ride the coat tails and, to some degree, do what hip-hop has done, where you have this voice and ain’t nobody saying shit. I’m into the UK scene, period, at the moment, with the broken [beat] and all that, they’re smashing it right now. Toby Laing Just originality and energy? Waajeed Do you, man. If you don’t leave with anything else today, just do you. Just your experience, what you’ve been taught by your parents, the houses that you’ve lived in, the neighborhoods that you’ve lived in, what your religion is, what your understanding of everything is, is so relevant. It’s your experience, don’t do somebody else, don’t follow somebody’s else’s path, don’t listen to the same influences somebody else has had and try to make them yours. All the people we respect and we enjoy and that we passionately follow, they were adamant about doing that. When Premo came out, nobody else was doing that. When Prince came out, there was nobody doing what he was doing. When Kraftwerk came out there was nobody doing what they were doing. Derrick May… we could just go on and on. I think it’s really relevant that people do not be ashamed of their experiences and use that as your strength because that’s really what it is. [applause] So, we got any questions? Where did you get that mic? audience member I’ve got one. I’m sorry, I’m a bit sore-throated because I was... Waajeed Screaming last night? Audience member Yes. Waajeed That’s a good look. Audience member Anyway, I have a comment and if you want to say something afterwards, feel free. There’s something really interesting about what you say. I’ve enjoyed listening to you say how many different things you enjoy and how much you recognize the scene in Detroit as a whole and don’t segment that, and how you are always on the look-out for new shit around the world. I wish other producers could see it like that. We all heard you play stuff last night that was completely unexpected and that’s so fresh. I really don’t know why it took so much time for people to try and join the gap between Detroit house or techno and hip-hop. For so long I’ve listened to Theo Parrish records and
your own, and perhaps you don’t quantize so much, and on the second or third beat you might not have the kick on top of the snare but the flow and the arrangement is more or less the same message. I guess, the only guys going across and completely doing it are Kid Sublime and those cats in Amsterdam, really joining the two universes in one. I just wish there were more people that were not so existentialist about what they’re doing, so it would generate a lot more dynamic between the two universes. The first time I heard you being interviewed on Benji’s show, you said listening to “It Is What It Is” while driving a car was the best experience you could have in Detroit at night. I thought, “This guy’s got it,” you’re not restricted, and that is very fresh and I respect that. Waajeed Thank you, man. I appreciate that. [applause] I think the biggest part of this job… I won’t call it a job, the biggest part of what I do… I don’t think enough people realize if I make all this music and people don’t like it, nobody’s going to give a fuck anyway. Our biggest job, and I’m speaking about us, because you’re just as relevant as I am, is to reflect the voice of the people. They treat stars like stars are above us, but our job is to make music for people. And with that responsibility, you’ve got to shake every hand, you’ve got to kiss every baby, you’ve got to sign every autograph, you’ve got to go out there and make it work. It’s hands-on, it’s not the kind of thing where Andy Warhol is back there, you’ve got to speak to a guy to speak to Andy and then Andy will speak to you. It’s hand-to-hand real shit here and I’m just positive I’m going to see a lot of your faces in these magazines. I’m just excited about that, I’m excited about you taking this great experience and making it work. [Long delay] You went through a lot of problems to get the mic, so you better say something fresh. Audience member It’s just a stupid technical question. You don’t solely use the MPC, yeah? You have MIDI keyboards or something? Waajeed I hate MIDI, man. Audience member Sorry about that. Waajeed No, no, no. It’s no disrespect to you, but I hate MIDI. I’ve had so many of my friends tell me, “You can do this with MIDI, you can do that…” I don’t want to read a book, I just want to jump in [applause]. No, no, that’s probably pretty messed up. I don’t know much about MIDI, and my dad always had a saying when I was young, just fake it till you make it. That’s pretty much what I do, so if I can get a sound from here that’s on a tape, it’s just gumbo. Whatever I can get. I’ve just recently been dabbling in Reason, and Reason is a really good tool for a person that’s on the move. If you’re on a plane and you want to knock out some rough ideas, Reason is a really good thing for that. Have y’all been using Reason? Reason is really fresh and maybe tonight in the studios I can give you some tips on how to get the drums nasty on that. Reason is a good thing, but in general I just use whatever I can, whatever’s in the studio. Audience member Do you engineer your own stuff? Waajeed Unfortunately, yes. And when I say unfortunately, there’s some cats that can really do it, like this dude [points to audience]. That’s his job, that’s what he does, but out of necessity and turnaround I’ve found myself engineering stuff. But with that, it definitely helps me to deal with sound differently, and even if I’m not engineering I’ve always got something to say, like, “Turn that up a little bit.” That’s really my pet peeve, I’m really funny about how things sound and how the public gets to hear them, because if you’re not in the room, people are going to judge you from your music and what it sounds like, so that’s something to take seriously. I mean, I engineer, but not because I want to most of the time. audience member So, you record all those lyrics? Waajeed Yes. Yo, on “50 Ways” on the PPP album, this dude called Raheem Devaughn was one of the first people to record the vocals. I remember, we were in this hotel room in DC that had this huge mouse in it – that’s part of where the name Platinum Pied Pipers came from; we were making jokes about this mouse in a five-star hotel. Anyway, we were in this hotel recording these vocals on our Mbox – by the way, none of that album was recorded in the studio, really… because the budget didn’t allow that. We were recording, and this dude did 152 takes of this song… and that’s what made me turn off from engineering that day. So, yeah, I do record those vocals and it’s a pain in the butt. audience member When you work with singers, where do you pick them up, or do they fall from the sky, or people you know who know people? Where do they come from in general in the real world? Waajeed Part of my job when I was with Slum was not just to pick up girls, but to get the demo tapes to them [laughs]. Funnily enough, a lot of the people I’m in contact with now are people who gave me demo tapes all those years ago – people who nobody deemed important enough to give them a record deal. I assembled these people, who I thought are more talented than a lot of people in the industry now, and compiled them on the Platinum Pied Pipers project. So always listen to demo tapes. So, whoever gives you a tape – if you get your first record out and people give you tapes, listen to them, because there’s always a diamond in the rough. You might get 20 wack ones and I’ve had some terrible ones, but one out of that 20, one might be golden. Does that answer your question? audience member Yeah, quite well. So, I’ll be giving you my CD later. Waajeed I’ll take that. Before I leave, there’s one record that I need to play and I’ve got a story behind it, like I’ve got a story behind everything. My family threw a party in my backyard when I was a kid. They wouldn’t let the kids come out but we were good enough to serve the drinks to all the people who came by the side door. They kept us in the house and they partied in the backyard and I remember looking out and hearing this record and not knowing what the hell this record was. What were these people thinking about? What were they smoking when they made this record? What were they on? And the reason this record was so relevant is I remember seeing my dad dancing, and he can’t dance at all, and he was trying to dance on the patio and he slipped and fell. And as funny as this was, the record was so intense nobody even cared. The record was so banging. It’s called... Audience member Let it be a blind test. Waajeed Alright, that sounds good to me. [music: Model 500 – “No UFOs”] Waajeed You know it? What’s the name of the record? audience member “No UFOs.” Waajeed Correct. What were they thinking of? This is nuts. All right, I’m going to turn it down and let you get the hell out of here because I’ve been talking for hours.

Wally Badarou
Musician and producer Wally Badarou may not be a household name, but his fingers have jammed the synth melodies that grace some of the most memorable and irresistible songs in modern music. From Fela to Mick Jagger to James Brown, it’s way easier to talk about the musicians Badarou hasn’t worked with.
In his lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy, Badarou breaks down some of the secrets behind working with Sly and Robbie while also offering a fly on the keyboard view of recording Pop Muzik with Robin Scott and explaining why he refused to sign that contract with the Godfather of Soul.
Hosted by Benji B Now, as I was just discussing with my colleague, Jeff, there's enough to talk about to make this lecture last about a week. We're going to do our best to try and navigate it in the next 90 minutes or so. I think really the most natural point to start off in this huge area that we have to talk about is really to ask you, Wally, what it is that made you first do what you do? Wally Badarou Hello everybody, hope you’re all doing alright. Jetlag has passed away? I suppose it’s a seek for visuals, a seek for honesty and many things. When I was young, when I was about 14, anyone who knew me would swear that I was to become a pilot because I was into aviation so much. Anything that resembled a cockpit was heaven for me and the first time I entered a recording studio I saw a cockpit. I saw a place that was nothing, that was just cold equipment, cold gear, and you just had to bring your knowledge, your experience of life, what it is that you wanted to do and where you wanted to go to make it fly. That's what a recording studio is to me ever since. Nowadays it's a laptop, but that hasn't changed. It's the same thing. That's what made me do what I do. Benji B How would you best describe what it is that you do? Wally Badarou If you look at my website you would see the first thing I put was a painter. I think I’m a painter. Actually, I thought I was but I didn’t dare say it up until Manu Dibango told me, “Wally, you’re a painter,” and I said, “Oh, yes. Thank you. That’s exactly what I want to be.” I’m a painter, but I think we’re very privileged in making music that we design to think that we want to paint and painters normally, actually, take their models from outside of their minds to actually paint something. Unless we’re talking about abstract painting. Even abstract painting derives more or less from the regular thing that you can’t actually see. I’m a painter. I’m a soul painter. I paint with music. I paint with notes. I paint with sounds. I paint with melodies. Melodies come first to me. I know it sounds a bit strange for somebody that loves James Brown, but I can tell that James Brown is a melody man before being a rhythm, a groove maker. Benji B How can you tell that? Wally Badarou Well, listen back to what he did in the ’50s, ’60s, and you’ll find out that he was an incredible melody singer to start with. Benji B In melody versus groove, melody wins for you? Wally Badarou Yes. That’s a very hard issue to me, even today. I believe that the value of a melody is difficult to appreciate. It is more than just putting notes together. It is actually creating textures. With just a melody, with just knowing exactly what an instrument can do you can create things that the best synthesizer in the world won’t do. I’m a synthesizer specialist, by the way. Sorry to say. The more I learn, and the more I get I’m growing to mastering my machines the more I realized that people like Ravel and Debussy were capable of doing the exact same thing, even better than what we do with synthesizers, just by using the right timbre from an oboe and a cello and a flute and a violin. They do that just by telling each of them what exactly to play. What note to play. I believe that, also, if you listen to, I don’t know how many of us here know about Joseph Savino, weather report, he would pick up any synthesizer even the cheapest one, plastic sounding chord machine, and make it sound incredible. Simply because he’d be playing the right notes. That to me is key. Benji B Though you paint with a range of different mediums, as a producer and as a musician your paintbrush of choice is the keys... Wally Badarou It’s the keys, yes. It’s the synthesizer. I see in the synthesizer the extension of the recording studio medium, which is that you’d have something that is totally bland that has nothing. I mean, when I started with the synthesizer. Nowadays the synthesizers are loaded with thousands of sounds and you can download them by the millions, but when I started out a synthesizer was just a blank piece of machine with just patch chords and we had to devise the sound from the ground up. And that was what a recording studio was also. Tape machine was just sitting there and you had to put something into it that would make the whole of the world dance to what you did. That for me, it’s unbelievable. It still is an unbelievable experience. I will tell you about what I’m doing nowadays, if you ask me, “What do you do today, Wally?” I know that we’ll come back to that later. I’m a stage actor. Yes. I went into theater five years ago and I embraced that thing like, wow, and I thought it was that different from music. It’s the exact same thing. But we are very privileged that the thing that we are expressing come from our inner soul. Where a stage actor will impersonate somebody that is a character out of a book, out of a novel. Why was I going onto that? I can’t remember anymore. Benji B What you’re doing right now. Wally Badarou Yes, because I just wanted to talk about what actually is the beginning of things. What I love about music is that you can actually go anywhere in the world. Do I have a favorite place in the world? No. I can be happy anywhere as long as I have a place where I can start something that is within myself and I will propel, that I will project to the world. That will go beyond the four walls of wherever I am. That’s basically it. Yeah. Benji B Even though you consider yourself a citizen of the world now, and have traveled everywhere, where did it start for you? Where were you born? Wally Badarou I’m African from Benin. Yoruba. From a Muslim father. A Catholic mother. I speak French. I speak English. I spent ten years in Africa, about ten to 15 years in the Bahamas speaking English. I spent a lot of time in London eating Indian food and the rest of it in France and in America. So, I belong to the world. Actually it sounds corny, but it’s a reality. One of my main mottos is that you are not reduced to where you come from. Where you were raised is part of who you are, but so is everywhere else, each and every experience that you go through is your roots, just as much as where you come from. That’s my belief. All those wonderful experiences, all those wonderful people that I’ve been privileged to work with are my foundation, just as much as where I come from. Benji B Just to fill people in, can you give us a few examples of people that you have collaborated with over the years? Wally Badarou I’ve been really privileged to work with some of my heroes. To start with yesterday I named a few. The music that was on when you came in was from Fela, and I produced a double album by Fela made of three songs. I worked with James Brown, the “Godfather of Soul,” that was a very short-lived experience but we will talk about that later. I worked with Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones. I worked with Paul McCartney, we had a jam together in my studio. I just cannot believe even today that I did all those things with all those people. Herbie Hancock, Josef Zawinul. I am yet to work with Stevie Wonder, but we worked with Quincy Jones on the French bicentennial, he was our godfather. That’s more or less it, really. Benji B When would you say was the bulk of your most well-known music recorded? Wally Badarou In the ’80s, I would say. Most of what people know about me came from the ’80s area. In Europe and England I was involved with a band called Level 42. I was the so-called fifth member. I not only worked with them but we co-wrote tunes together. That was from the England side of things. From the West Indies, Island Records side of things, I would be talking about Grace Jones, Robert Palmer, the Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Jimmy Cliff, a bit of Bob Marley on a soundtrack that I did that was called Countryman. Um, Gregory Isaacs. I don’t have a list of all that stuff. All that era. French artists as well, maybe if I say Serge Gainsbourg it will mean something to someone here. [people in audience nod] OK. Also lots of African artists, like Manu Dibango, Salif Keita, Youssou N’Dour. I had the privilege to work with a fabulous Indian percussion player called Trilok Gurtu. I went to Bombay to work with him. Benji B I think we are going to go into depth in some of those areas later on, but you also were involved as a session player with some absolute smash hits in the ’80s, certainly some records that were on heavy rotation when I was a child. Shall we let them have a listen? (music: Robert Palmer – “Addicted To Love”) (music: Foreigner – “I Wanna Know What Love Is”) (music: M – “Pop Muzik”) Wally Badarou That one, “Pop Muzik,” was actually very precious to me because it was the very first one I did with a British band. Up to then I was just a regular French session player. And I was working on small pieces of music – should I be honest to everybody here? For “films roses,” doing little pieces of music for, say, sex movies. You got to make a living somewhere. [laughter] The bass player was English and the drummer was English and between sessions we used to jam a bit. One of them said, “You should meet my brother. He is working on something I am sure you are going to love it.” So one day I was sleeping because I had a very long night demo-ing on my four-track Teac machine. I received a call from that guy, “Wally, you should come over, it’s great!“ And I said, “I am too tired,” but I went over anyway. I brought my Korg machine which only had one preset, polyphonic ensemble, and there it was. It was “Pop Muzik.” It was his 15th version of the song. And we spent a whole week devising just the bass sound because in those days synthesizers didn’t have neither memory nor MIDI. So by the time we had the sound it was out of tune and we couldn’t keep it so we had to do it again. [video cuts to new section] The Compass Point All Stars was a dream of the founder of Island Records, Christopher Blackwell. He had an album that he wanted to do for Grace Jones, who happened to be Jamaican also, and his idea was to get some kind of a cocktail of musicians. He had Sly & Robbie in the pocket already. He did not know me, but he had heard of me through “Pop Muzik” and also with a band I used to do with a band called the Gibson Brothers, a tune called “Cuba,” and he said, “OK, Wally, I want you on this.” And I took the plane and landed there and met Sly, Robbie. I did not know who those guys were, really. Even Chris Blackwell. I saw somebody coming to the control room, barefooted, just sitting relaxed and everything. “Oh, you want to do this? OK.” I was furious. Why? I was a regular session player and you say nine o’clock in the morning and at five to nine, I’m there, ready to go. In the Bahamas – we’re talking Jamaican style, we are talking “soon come.” So I waited for four days and nothing happened. When the session finally started, I was furious, I just wanted to go home, I had had enough of it there, up until we did “Private Life.” Do you have that thing? (music: Grace Jones – “Private Life”) ... So, it would have been very difficult publishing-wise to start to share credit. Still, today nobody would do that without getting a share [of the credit], right? [to participant] You wouldn’t do that without having a share, would you? (music: Grace Jones – “Private Life (Dub)”) I used to be called Prophet. “Hey, Prophet!” Ah, look at that. And it was, buy-ba-yup-by-yubup. To me it was just, OK, this is what I have for the time being. I’ll come back later and devise something smarter than this. I can’t leave this. You can’t keep this. There we go again. The good thing about working with people also is that you learn from them. You learn from their body language, you learn from the way they react, that you’re actually there. The thing that you’re looking for is already there. You don’t have to be too hard on yourself sometimes. Benji B Can you tell us about what you learned from Sly & Robbie in that period? Wally Badarou Well, that very thing, which is that if it was not cooking, it was not cooking, and there was no point trying to even go any further. Blackwell will come with a bunch of tunes to try, and they will give just a couple tries to each of them. If, on the second try, if it was not cooking, forget it. I was like, “That’s it. Look, we can still do it. We can do it, please.” “No, no. It’s not happening. Forget it.” And they were right, because see, when I left Nassau, the very first year, I was so happy to be back to the regular thing. You know, nine in the morning, five to nine. I’m on time. I was doing all those boring sessions, and one day I just put a cassette of the rough mixes of those things and I listened and realized that this was music. That’s what music is all about. It’s got to be just there. Sometimes it needs to be worked. Sometimes it just needs to flow. This is the hardest thing that we musicians have to come to terms with. When is it that you actually made it? Do you still need to work harder on what you did, or is it already there? How do you define that? There’s some level of self-censorship that we have to go through. Even I, I come with things. There’s one tune that I want you to have a listen to, but I’m not even sure that you should listen to it because I don’t know if it’s already there yet, you know? How do you define that? That’s where being a producer comes in. Benji B When is the painting finished, kind of thing? Wally Badarou Exactly. Talking about Fela, for instance. How can you produce Fela? Nobody can produce Fela. He is larger than life, OK? But even being larger than life, sometimes it’s good to have that other ear who’s going to tell you that you already done it. It’s there. Don’t go any further. That’s all I did. I did not give any direction to Fela. I mean, Fela knows what he’s doing. I cannot teach him Afrobeat. Benji B Yeah, but you still have to record the fifteen horns in the back. Wally Badarou Yeah, and the 20 women and fight against that kid who is trying to shut the SSL computer off right in the middle of the mix. That was horrendous, yet it was very short. We did the whole double album in three days from start to finish, mixing included. Well, we didn’t have much time to fiddle around anyway. Each song is about forty-five minutes long, so the question was, “When does it start, actually?” We just had to be ready to go onto to blood light, as they say in Jamaica. Red button. Benji B How did you know what was a take and what was rehearsal in that situation. Wally Badarou Well, we just guessed that. By the time they rehearsed the fifth or seventh section of the song, they were ready to go. For us, they didn’t even give us a start time. They just said, “One, two,” and it was, “Oh, get in,” and that was the take. There was no double take. There was no second chance. Benji B We’ve spoken extensively about your work as a session musician and as an arranger, but as you’ve just mentioned, you also did a lot of producing as well. In your mind, what is a producer? Wally Badarou As I tried to say, it’s actually, for me, the man who is an alter-ego to the artist and who will be able to tell him that he is already there. That’s basically what a producer is. Actually, it is more than that obviously. In a conventional way the producer would choose the material with the artist, would choose the studio, the engineer, the musicians, the arranger – all of that. That is what a producer used to be in my days. Nowadays, people believe that being a producer is to go into a studio with a drum machine or a computer and start programming things. I never do that unless that is part of what the artist wants me to do. Being a producer for me is from start to finish discussing the project. What is it that you want to do? Why do you want to do this album? What is it that you want to make it different from the rest of the pack? Discuss that in-depth before going to the studio. Benji B How do you get the best out of the artist once you are in the actual creative zone in the studio? What is the secret? Wally Badarou I don’t know if there is any. It really depends on the artist, it depends on the vibes, it depends on the music. There are always so many different parameters. There is one artist called Carlinhos Brown from Brazil. The man wouldn’t stop writing. Every day he came with ten new songs. “Wally, you should listen to this! Listen to this! Listen to this!” I said, “Please, let’s finish what we already have in the works, and then we will go into something else.” There was a song called “Argila,” which was one of these new ideas, and it is one of the best songs in the album. I had to give to him at least a chance to listen to the album. He played acoustic guitar and I played Fender Rhodes and we did it in one take. We did it in one take because it was late at night, I was hungry, I was tired and I wanted to go home. And it is one of the best songs on the album. Benji B As a producer, how do you react to being produced? Wally Badarou I’ve never been produced as a solo artist. As a session musician, it is like being an actor, you take directions from the producer. But most of the time I have been very lucky to work with a lot of people who wanted me in the studio because they knew that the type of color I would bring in, the type of melodies, counter-melodies, gimmicks and everything would just fit the work. One of the great examples of this is Gregory Isaacs’s Night Nurse – one of my all time favorite albums because it happened so very easily. The album was not even planned to me, I just landed there and found out I was wanted on board, “Here’s the Prophet 5.” I was jetlagged, I was tired. Again, most of the great events of my life happened when I wanted to go home. It was a one night thing for me. All those 15 tracks maybe, done in one night! They had been cutting down the tracks for three or four days before. It was real fast, real sparse, fantastic singing, lots of space, beautiful. Still today, I play it as if I wasn’t part of it. I’m really proud of that album. Benji B If you’re not sure what he’s talking about, you’ll definitely recognize this in a minute. (music: Gregory Isaacs – “Night Nurse”) Wally Badarou Thank you very much. Again, this is such an explicit example because what I did on that one was very simple as well. I only did that stab, badap-bap. Which is part of the rhythm, which is almost part of the melody. I was not told to do that. This is why I still believe that I am a melody man, because what I had in mind was a melody and I brought it to the song to finish or complete the idea already behind the melody. Sometimes it’s there and you don’t even notice. Benji B Before we move onto your work as a composer and your solo work, we should talk a bit about Level 42. It’s a big part of your life, right? Wally Badarou Yes. Level was also one of the things that I didn’t plan. It actually derived from the “Pop Muzik” experience. I met Phil Gould, the drummer, when we were rehearsing “Pop Muzik” for the BBC Top of the Pops music show. Again, we were just jamming in between takes and it happened that we loved the same thing, which was jazz fusion. Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Billy Cobham, John McLaughlin. He said, “Wally, I want you to meet that fantastic bass player that I am working with. His name is Mark and I am sure you are going to love what we do.” So I met Mark and that was it. It was jazz fusion and Mark was doing his thumb thing on the bass – incredible. But to me, I didn’t take it seriously because I was already really into that sort of thing in France years before, but I was just happy to fly to London to play with people. That was what made me come back to London. Aviation? London? And then gradually, they started to sell. And it was like, “Oh yes, we can sell that?” And they could sing, oh my god! The day I met Herbie Hancock, I had the chance to meet him. He said, “Wally, you don’t know, but you guys are blessed. Because not only can you play but you can sing.” I didn’t realize that. And not only could they sing but they could also write pop songs. A lot of people have been criticizing Level 42 for leaving the jazz fusion thing and going towards more commercial stuff. I would reply that, for us musicians, if you can devise a great melody, don’t be afraid to do so. No matter how hard you are going to be criticized for trying to seek commercial success. This is stupid. Just go for what you think is great. And having a great melody never hurts anybody. We managed to write and co-write hits together. Till today I am proud of it and that makes my living. Thank you! (music: Level 42 – “Starchild”) Benji B Tell us, for the nerds in the room, what are the synths you are using on that one? Wally Badarou Prophet 5. I’ve been a Prophet 5 man for quite a long time. I started out with Korg machines at first. My main horse for quite a long time was a Korg 800-DV, dual voices. Then I switched onto the Prophet 5. Then, before I could afford it, I was granted enough money in a publishing advance to get a Synclavier. Now, let me talk about the Synclavier. The Synclavier is a dinosaur today. It is a huge machine, much larger than this speaker, higher than that. It was not a micro computer it was a mini computer in those days, a main frame computer. It was one of the first machines ever to be able to sample. To be able to do some FM synthesis, which now is commonplace, like the DX7 and everything. To do notation on the screen, to have a hard drive, to have a floppy drive – all those things are commonplace today, were pioneered either by the Synclavier from New England Digital or the Fairlight, which was the equivalent almost. The Synclavier had that thing that still makes it one of the best machines even today: The quality of the digital to analog converters. They are much better than the Pro Tools one even today. They are almost like the Apogee’s, I would say. Even today they will have Synclavier rooms in Hollywood, if you are listening to Titanic, you are listening to the Synclavier. It was extremely expensive, because it was a pioneering machine. Adding anything on to it was mind-bogglingly expensive, sixty thousand dollars just to add a four-track machine. Benji B What year was that? Wally Badarou That was back in 1986 or ’87. That was a lot of money. That was why they went down the well. Nowadays, with a laptop you can do just as much, but in those days being able to compose, play music, not having to rewind, being able to change the sound without having to perform again, that was unbelievable. Unbelievable! I remember days and nights I was staying awake thinking back, “I wish I had this machine when I was doing that album!” When I had to redo it all over again because one sound was a little out of tune. I still have the Synclavier, it’s a wonderful piece of furniture. [laughter] I don’t use it anymore. A very beautiful piece of furniture, very expensive. Benji B You are evidently someone who embraced technology from the onset. What is your weapon of choice today? Wally Badarou Well, like everybody else in this room I am doing most of my work out of virtual synthesizers. I think it is unbelievable. I think it’s great. I still need my vintage just to feel like any time I want to indulge into the hands-on knobs fashion, I can still revert to that. But as I evolve, I am happy just dealing with a mouse. As long as I can still create my own sounds, which is what I really encourage everybody here to do. Of course, we have tons and millions of sounds at reach because we can download easily, we can have tones, and we can muck about and change this and that. Still you end up sounding like most of the rest of the pack. There is nothing like coming almost from scratch and devising your own sound. It’s not just self-fulfilling, it’s also putting you apart. You can create something very distinct that way. It is almost the only way that you can do that. I haven’t been proven wrong so far. Can I play something out of my machine here? (music: Level 42 — unknown) OK, now one more thing very quickly. (music: I Muvrini – unknown) The common thing between those two songs is the sound in the background and that sound I spent nights developing. The first thing was Level 42, obviously, and the second one was a Corsican band called I Muvrini. That sound I spent nights developing. You cannot maybe realize, but what it’s doing, it is not like an organ sound, but like a pulsating heart that would be beating between left and right, not just doing a vibrato, not just doing a tremolo, but more than that, it is moving within itself. If you had cans on your ears you would be surrounded by something which would remind you of being in a rock type situation. When those Corsican guys called me, they heard that Level 42 thing and they knew it would work for their song. That is what I like about being able to craft your own sound. Benji B Everyone has their own line in the sand about intellectual copyright and where that starts and ends. In your mind, do you feel you really have to create your own sound to feel your music is truly your own? Wally Badarou Yes, probably because I’ve been raised that way. Even today, most people assume that I am very good at sampling. I am not. People think that because I have a Synclavier I have a huge library of sounds. I do not. Most of the sounds that you hear me playing are sounds I have created either from scratch or from the very basic sine wave tables. But it is something I really want to develop. I am not saying that everybody should be doing it; maybe you could be happy with using other peoples’ sound. But I wouldn’t be satisfied using other peoples’ sounds because I know I can do it myself. And, as a matter of fact, I’ve been part of developing sounds for companies like Arturia, the French-based virtual synthesizer makers. People of my generation want to believe that when you want to do things you can do it from scratch. Why buy sounds when you can do it by yourself? Benji B Which brings us on to the question of sampling and how you feel about that? Wally Badarou That’s an issue, because I am going to make a lot of enemies here, but when sampling was invented we thought that it was an opportunity given to us musicians to explore things that have never been done before, and that has been achieved to some extent. But then, that is probably not what most people have been using sampling for ever since. Most people actually use sampling to build upon other peoples’ work. There is nothing wrong with that. After all, anything that I do was also inspired by other peoples work. If you listen to “Chief Inspector,” all I was trying to do was emulate Lalo Schifrin’s “Mannix.” (music: Wally Badarou – “Chief Inspector”) ...mixing, having the musicians all together and everything. And, um, at first I felt uneasy about it. For quite a long time actually. But then I realized that doing that, you can still create something. It is not just building upon, you can actually retrieve things that the original work didn’t really pursue. So it could be an entire direction on its own. And as long as the original composer or artist is actually rewarded his own regular share and has been granted permission to do so, there is no problem. The issue here is that it’s kind of a delicate issue. If you listen to Stevie Wonder’s “Pastime Paradise” and then to Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise,” I would say, what I liked about “Pastime Paradise” is it went through all those changes, it’s not just a groove, it had a bridge and I love all those things about it. But if you asked Coolio, he would just say, no, it’s the groove, and we can just do the thing on the groove itself. It’s a different way of looking at things. I am more sensitive to what it was originally than to what it ended up being with Coolio. Yet I understand that there is a beauty to that as well. Being a first-hour fan of James Brown where I can listen to “Escap-ism” for hours, or tunes like “Sex Machine” around the clock until six o’clock in the morning. I am sensitive to just groove-based music as well. Benji B You mention James Brown and obviously, whole generations of people spent their lives extending the breaks in the middle of those songs, and that goes for your songs too. Are you aware of the fact that a lot of your work with that rhythm section of Sly & Robbie had on the hip-hop generation? I’ve got a couple of things here... (music: Kool DJ Red Alert beat-juggling Grace Jones “Pull Up to the Bumper”) Wally Badarou I do not relate to this personally, like on a musical level. I would relate to it more in terms of a reward. Anybody who will take any of the work that I’ve done in the past and using it is showing interest and that is enough of a reward for me. They don’t even have to justify. Years ago, I would have said, “You want to do a remix of my tune? OK, well, can I listen to it?” Nowadays, I don’t even do that anymore. You want to do your version of it, please, be my guest – do it! Should I appreciate what you do? In terms of music, I don’t know if that’s the issue. Whatever you do, I know that you are paying tribute to what I did, and that only is enough for me. When Stanley Kubrick took the music of Johann Strauss for 2001 Space Odyssey everyone thought it was a great idea. It’s not just a classic movie and a classical piece of music, but the combination of the two is a classic piece of art. Now, I would love to know what would Johann Strauss think of it. Maybe he would say, “This guy did not have a clue about what my music is all about.” Benji B We’ve got a good example of the blurred line between sampling and the cover version. Or sampling and the remix. What I’m about to play comes from one of Wally Badarou’s solo albums entitled Echoes and if you are not already familiar with this album, you may well recognise what I am about to play via a different source. This track is called “Mambo.” (music: Wally Badarou — “Mambo” / applause) (Massive Attack - “Daydreaming” / laughter) When there is sampling on that level, as the artist – how do you feel about that? Wally Badarou Great! [laughter / applause] They took the whole lot, right? But it was done on purpose, this had been discussed before they did it. I had no problem with that at all. I believe it’s a tribute and that’s how I should look at it. Benji B And on that level, just to touch on some of the more boring, business side of things. For people that are in the process of starting their own creations, be that on labels or through digital media or whatever, are there some basic business pitfalls to watch out for that you may have learned from? Wally Badarou I wish I had some recipes or secrets but I don’t, really. My only advice is – you are out in the bushes; it’s a jungle out there, right? Depending on who you meet, on who you work with, depending on your personality, depending on so many parameters, things are going to change. Sometimes, you need to be forceful about things. Sometimes, you need to let things flow. All you need, I believe, is to keep your eyes open, no matter what. It’s a really, really crowded world out there and it is very difficult to get noticed. Each of us believe that people should take pay attention to what we do. Maybe the secret is to be able to accept that this might not be the case all the time, but it will be the case once. When will that be? How will that be? Who with? You cannot plan, no matter how hard you try. Even today, listening to these things, sitting here in front of you guys, is overwhelmingly difficult to understand to me. What did I do? I mean, look, this piece, “Mambo,” do you know how it was crafted? LinnDrum, that was a drum machine. I was just fiddling with the machine, trying to work out how to store the programs and I had that thing and I had the “Chief Inspector” drums and that was it. It’s as easy as that. Then in the studio we had a ball, the engineer and myself, listening just to drums and that was why you had that long introduction to the melody. I did not expect that tune to go any further than, say, a few Hollywood people who might think it could be a good soundtrack to a film. And that was it. Then, for Massive Attack to have used it, it was unbelievable. It was not expected. That is the beauty of it, when you do not expect success, that’s where you can really nail it. Anything which has been forged towards success, to me, never really works. Look, I worked with Mick Jagger. Has anyone heard that tune that I did? Can I play it? (music: Mick Jagger – “Lucky In Love”) Well, well, well. He was lucky in love. [laughter] That never really did it, really. But I feel privileged that I was part of his first solo effort. I worked with Fela, it was a good album, yet it didn’t sell massive. Things that really worked for me were not “prestigious,” they were simple things, like the Level 42, I never thought that it would work. The Chief Inspector thing, and “Pop Muzik” was refused everywhere. That guy fought hard to have a label release it. Robert Palmer, “Addicted to Love” was supposed to be a failure up until we had the video. “I Want To Know What Love Is,” that was supposed to be a failure too. I mean, the album was so expensive that the record company, I think it was Warner, thought that the album would go down the well just like Titanic. It was supposed to be a Titanic album and it sold millions. Benji B So what is success to you? Wally Badarou It is just that unexpected thing. It is that thing that you go with your heart and you do not really plan anything other than to be true to yourself and put down what you think is good. That’s it. It’s a magical moment in time and space where what you do meets what people are ready to listen to. It’s a cross-section between those two curves. How much you can plan what people are going to be available to and what you actually do... How can you plan those two? There are people called record executives, A&R people, who are paid to understand those curves. I wouldn’t like their job, not at all. I prefer mine, I tell you. No matter how successful or unsuccessful I may be – because believe it or not, I have more failures than successes, even though all those things show like, “Oh, well he can do anything. Anything he does just goes beyond...” You know? That’s not true. Before I get that, there’s been a lot and a long string of unsuccesses, or failures. You have to take your part of that. Benji B I just want to go back to the film thing for a minute, because you just reminded me, talking about 2001 and the soundtrack for that, that you’ve also scored for films, right? We should definitely mention that. Wally Badarou Yes. Benji B I think for a lot of composers, that’s a dream thing to do, to score for a film. What’s the difference in the discipline of scoring film and composing a song for a record? Wally Badarou Well, it’s almost the total opposite. It’s a job on its own. Quite honestly, I don’t know that I’m successful at it. I believe that I’ve been lucky to work on films that were successful. I don’t know how much that has anything to do with my own scoring, although people would say differently. I believe that scoring is actually adding your imagination to somebody else’s imagination, and that’s the very difficult part of it. It means that you actually have to bring something that that person doesn’t even express up until you actually express it for him. That’s what makes it so difficult for film directors to pick up a composer. They are very, very, very sensitive to that. Music is such a powerful medium. With music you can destroy a movie as much as you can elevate it. It almost has nothing to do with composing. It really is co-painting with the film director, and it’s very hard because the film director has his own idea of what the movie is all about, and it takes more than collaborating with another co-composer, but it takes structurally go into somebody’s visions of things that can be preset way before you actually get into the picture. Some people are really good at it, and I really admire them. OK? I admire John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, all those great composers. There’s a fantastic great composer, a French composer, Vladimir Cosma, who I happen to know, and he told me, “Wally, you are blessed. You are blessed because you can do things without somebody else’s imagination. It’s yours that comes first. Mambo.” Ever since, I believed that if I can score for a movie, that’s great. It’s a dream, because we always sit in a chair. We always enjoy the John Williams behind Star Wars. But, if you can make music that will make people fly in their imagination, that’s even more powerful. So, that’s it really. Benji B Can you tell us some of the films you’ve done music for? Wally Badarou I’ve been privileged to work on Kiss of the Spider Woman, that was a movie by Hector Babenco, which granted an Oscar for Best Actor to William Hurt. And, that year, that was 1985, I was part of those people who can make Oscar-winning movies. Then I was flown first class, and I had a limousine, I had five-star hotel, all that year because people just wanted me to be on board their movie, without even knowing the kind of music I did. That’s strange. Benji B Is it a very hard world to penetrate, the world of music scoring for film and television? Wally Badarou I think it is. It’s like anything else, really. You have clubs. If you have a good agent, then you can make it. If you don’t have a good agent and if you haven’t been lucky enough to come with a hit movie, then you stay nowhere. It’s like anything really. It really is. I’m still puzzled by that process of scoring movies. I still wonder what it is that is required to make a great score. I’m just like you guys. I’m still learning. Benji B So let’s talk about your solo albums. There’s three main ones, right? Wally Badarou Right. The first album that had those numbers that you know, like “Chief Inspector,” “Mambo,” was really rhythm oriented and was going different places, which I wanted to explore later. Then “Chief Inspector” had sort of success in England and “Mambo,” and I was afraid to be reduced to just a groove thing, and I just wanted to make sure that people understood that I could do something else as well. So I came up with a second album, which was more classical-oriented and I could show also more of my programming sound. Can I play something? Just one section, won’t be long. Benji B And this is also on Island Records. Your relationship with Chris Blackwell’s Island went on throughout the ’80s, right? Wally Badarou That’s right. Benji B And it seems to be quite a fruitful relationship. When was this one released? Wally Badarou It was 1988, 1989. Oh, Echoes album was 1983 or ’84. Benji B Right. Wally Badarou Then ’88, ’89 was Words of a Mountain. For instance, this thing that I was crafting, (music: Wally Badarou – “Wolves in the Urals”) So this album is really made of all those textures, of sounds evolving, morphing, from one to another and also, it was more melodically-based. Again, I didn’t want be reduced to that neither. And then I also wanted to show what it is that makes me an African artist as well. So I came up with a third album in 2001, which had something like... Do I have it here? No, I don’t have it here. Something in the vein of this. (music: Wally Badarou – unknown) OK, so those are the three things that I’ve been basing my work on, which is, I could do some hip-hop, R&B, jazz, soul. I could do some real orchestrated work as well. And I do also some African thing as well. I just didn’t want to be reduced to any of those three branches. I just wanted people to understand that that was those three things at the same time. Benji B So I guess this brings us onto the title of this session, really, “Where’s Wally?” Because evidently there’s an unbelievable body of work throughout the ’80s, up until ’89, and then there’s nothing until 2001. Wally Badarou That’s right. Benji B Kind of missing in action. Why did you decide to take your foot off the gas for a minute? Wally Badarou First of all, I was quite happy and lucky to have gone through the ’80s the way I went, which is working with great people and coming up with great projects. Yet, out of the ’80s, I felt that I wanted to just concentrate on my own work. And by that time, I was not looking for a direction, but I was accumulating material that I wanted to build upon. And I was called to produce people. I did quite a lot of African artists and Brazilian and Indian production. They didn’t get noticed, but they were there, so it didn’t feel to me that I was actually taking steps back from the scene. But, it just didn’t happen. I’m still working on my own next project, solo project. And in the meantime, I discovered stage acting five years ago. And I thought that this was, at long last, a way to bring the stage performance together with music because, as I told you at the beginning, I’m a studio man, basically, when it comes to music. I’m a solitary worker. I work just by myself, and I love that. I love to collaborate with people also, but it remains a studio-confined effort. I didn’t do much live work as a musician. I never toured with Level 42, for instance. I discovered stage acting because somebody made me believe that I could direct a movie one day. I said, “Oh my God, if that ever happens I better know what it is to be an actor before I pretend that I can direct an actor.” So I went from the basics, I took lessons and discovered a new love, which is stage acting. Which is unbelievable. That explained also that I am taking longer to complete my next musical project, but it will happen. Don’t you ever worry. Benji B Thanks then. Well, I think at this point we need to say thank you. [audience applause] Wally Badarou Thank you. Benji B It’s not quite over yet, Wally, because I am about to open the questions up to the floor. Please, please don’t feel shy about asking questions. I know this is the first lecture, but it’s highly likely that anything that you are interested in finding out the answer to, the rest of us are as well. Is there anyone that would like to elect themselves? Great, OK. There should be a mic on it’s way to you soonish. Audience Member Hi, Wally. Thanks so much, that was an incredible speech. I’m sure we all really appreciate it. I’ve just got a question in particular about this record here, Nightclubbing. This is probably one of my favorite records ever. It’s actually Nina’s record, but I’ve got this back at the hotel as well. I’m sorry I’m rambling on here. My question is with the stuff that you did, the pop stuff that we played earlier, it’s very much the US sort of influence, and then you had the Level 42 was to me a very English sort of sound. But this record here when I first heard it, it was just a very exotic sort of sound to me. I guess working with Sly & Robbie that was a very sort of Jamaican sound. On that record in particular, the outstanding track to me was “I’ve Seen That Face Before.” That was just a very exotic, French sort of sounding record. Can you talk to us about that record? Wally Badarou That was the point actually. When Chris Blackwell had that idea of making me and Barry Reynolds, the guitar player who used to work a lot with Marianne Faithfull, to join Sly & Robbie was to actually create that sort of cocktail of influences. It was not going to be a regular reggae session. It was not going to be a regular disco session either. I remember when we flew together, Barry and I, and discovered Sly & Robbie, we were fighting because we knew that these guys were Jamaican and they were going to ask us, “Can you play reggae?” And we would come in and say, “Well, we don’t know that we can play reggae, but can you read music?” Anyway, that never happened. Actually, there was a sense of uneasiness at first. Then the whole thing started to gel from “Private Life.” Then we realized that there was a groove and there was some sophisticated synthetic electronic palettes upon the groove. That’s what made it so different. So that was the key. Audience Member Yeah, that’s fantastic. Thank you. Benji B A good tune to illustrate that work. Wally Badarou She needs a mic. Audience Member Thank you. I just wanted to ask more about the actual creation of sounds. Listening to your stuff is breathtaking. I was wondering with all the incredible people you get to work with, do you ever take stuff from the sessions? As far as sampling, I know that’s a touchy issue, but take like, say you work with an amazing singer or vocalist, when you have those strings coming in on that sound it almost sounded like you couldn’t tell if it was a violin or a voice. Do you use, from working in these sessions have you ever taken people’s things and worked them in to these incredible soundscapes that you’re making in sounds? Wally Badarou Most of the time I would develop all those sounds by myself. I’m glad you are raising that issue, because it has always been a question on how I would work. Developing a sound takes time. It’s a time-consuming process. Most of the time you have producer, the artist, and everybody sitting here just getting bored to death, because it’s not very spectacular. It’s not entertaining at all. I mean, it wasn’t. That’s probably where being familiar with your machine was key first. Secondly, working with people who understood the process was very important. Chris Blackwell, who produced those Grace Jones albums, realized from day one that I needed my space before myspace.com was ever invented. He just left me alone. He said, “Wally needs his space. That’s Wally’s part now, everybody out of the studio.” I was privileged to have all the time I needed to do my own thing. When I worked on Foreigner, “I Want To Know What Love Is,” I had what we call slave tapes. I had my own studio within the big studio. When they were cutting all the drums and everything I had my own thing where I could develop my own sounds. So that was key, yes. Most of the sounds that I would use, even though I might not create them right on the spot, were created by myself either from other sessions or in my own home as well. It’s a combination of different sources. Some of them I would create from scratch. Audience Member Something like strings of a violin. I found some of the best synthesizers today had such a hard sound to come up with, and yours sounds so warm. Are you building on ones that are already synthesized or are you actually getting strings in to your bass? Wally Badarou Layers. Layers of different things, but it also has a lot to do with the line that I’m trying to do as well, so the sound will depend a lot on the line itself. The type of layers that I’ll be coming up with will be dependent on that as well. How to put it... It’s a combination of different things. Sometimes I would just muck about and fiddle with nubs and fiddle with the bank presets, but I would create. Then things will just pop in and I will say, “Oh, that’s cool. Let’s keep it.” That’s what happened with “Addicted to Love,” for instance. Most of the time I would try, I would think of something that I wanted to do and would develop a sound in respect to that thing I wanted to do. Audience Member Thank you. Wally Badarou Yes, please. There are two more over there. Audience Member Hi. Wally Badarou Hi. Audience Member As someone who has worked with as a composer and producer, in terms of making a record how would you weigh at the importance of composing the ideas and producing how those ideas are realized in to the final piece of music? Wally Badarou It’s the most difficult part, especially if you work by yourself. There’s a reason why I think it’s very important that no matter how you proceed that you get people to listen to what you do. At least listen to, if not produce. Producing has a lot to do with listening. Listening to what is actually happening. I found myself on the verge of losing it if I didn’t have somebody to come in and just listen to what I was doing. Just by the body language telling me how far I was to the point that I wanted to make. Producing is very hard. Self-producing is very hard. It’s like self-directing. I don’t know how Woody Allen does his movies. He’s incredible. He’s not just a great actor, not just a great movie storyteller, but he’s also self-directing, which is unbelievably hard. I believe that he must have, he too, him too, people who can watch. By just their body language, he can tell that he’s there or not. Yes. Does that answer your question? Audience Member Yeah. What I’m looking for is how you weigh out the importance of composition of the final production. Wally Badarou Composition is first. I know this is a strange place to say it, but composition to me is key. Production is important because it will make the value of the composition reach the world. Yet, if an idea doesn’t make it by your production, it may happen with somebody else’s production. As long as you have the gems in the can, which is the idea first, then you’re there. That’s how I think of it. I may be wrong. Sometimes I know that I’m wrong on that issue. This is what I want to believe. I feel more comfortable that way. Thank you. Audience Member First of all, I shall say that this is one of my most favorite albums ever. I guess, the first question is what’s it like when you first put those synths and Grace just, she was just here or synths first or what? How does it all work? Wally Badarou Grace would cut the tracks with us. Actually, the whole of the album was done very conventionally, which is that she would do guide vocals as we were playing. Chris Blackwell would sit as well in the studio with us. Then, parts would be fixed here and there, basses, guitar. Then I would have my own shot, fine-tuning, revising, redoing some of the parts. Then, she will do the finished vocals. That’s how it usually worked. Sometimes, she would do her vocals before I do my little icing things. Take for example that tune called “Libertango, I’ve Seen That Face Before.” That one actually was sung before I did most of the synthetic part on it, which allowed me to really be doing those things in between her vocals to highlight them. Pleasure. Audience Member How did you feel when you were at the table or are you sometimes on the guitar? Wally Badarou The way I write is very, very specific. I would proceed almost like Josef Zawinul, which is that I would sit on the acoustic piano and develop ideas on the acoustic piano, record them, and forget about them for years. Then, in the back of my mind without even knowing, ideas will flow out of those ideas to complete them, to make them richer, to develop them. I’m very grateful that you’re asking this question. I believe the composition has a lot to do with just that sparkling little idea at first that was magic even before you knew it. It’s a very simple, little tiny, little melody, chord change, sound, rhythm. It could last five seconds or half an hour, depending on how great you felt about when you did it. I know my weaknesses. I know that, just let it go, I will probably kill the thing without even knowing what was the real value. That’s why I never rush any of my production. That’s why it’s taking so long actually. I just leave this thing, age like good wine. You’re French, right? Yes. I like that. I leave it to rest like a good wine, and if three years later it still talks to me like it did when I did it, wow, I know I have something. Audience Member Can I ask another question too? [inaudible]? Wally Badarou Oh, no, actually, I tell you what. I’m glad you’re talking about it. We never watched the movies, no. We were doing those things that were called kilometers music. Music aux kilometre in French, right? Which means that all we were required to do was just any music, really. Just play music. We just had a long jam. We never watch any of those movies, sorry to say. Yes, anybody? Audience Member Hello? Wally Badarou Yes, hello. Audience Member What do you think about this virtual… Wally Badarou Synthesizers. I think they’re fantastic. They’re getting better and better and better and better. They lack one thing. Physical. Again, it’s a matter of generation. It’s a matter of getting used to whatever you have. People, you want to believe that you needed to fee; the knobs in order to actually come up with a great sound. It’s true, to a certain extent, if you’re used to it. Then, you can also do it differently. I used to have a Synclavier years ago. A Synclavier was what, a big keyboard, one knob. Loads of push buttons that you needed to activate in order to go to page number 23 in order to do this shape. I mean, it took forever, it could take forever. But then you could develop strategies to actually get faster to this or that aspect of things, which is not slower or more time-consuming than actually using your mouse or your trackpad. It’s a matter of getting used to whatever medium you have. Benji B If you have to take the Pepsi challenge on it, with a blindfold, are you really honest that you can’t hear a difference between the two? Wally Badarou Oh yes, you can. I’m not saying that you cannot. I’m saying that they’re just as good. I don’t want to develop a cult of vintage, I keep my vintage gear because I know it, that’s all. I could almost blind program the Prophet 5, I know where the knobs are, “OK, OK, alright.” Because I know the Prophet 5, I’ve been using it for so long. There’s also a distinct sound out of it. Whether the emulation of the virtual copy of the Prophet 5 matches or does not match the Prophet 5 is no issue to me. It has its own distinct thing as well. I’m sure that one day people are going to look at those virtual synthesizer as being just classic as just the Prophet 5 ever was. I remember when the Prophet 5 came in, people used to laugh at it also, saying, “Well, it doesn’t have the meat that you can have on the CS-80 Yamaha.” Yes, but today, it’s a classic. What the fuss, sorry. Excuse my French. Yes? Audience Member I just have a question about performance. It’s refreshing to see you not getting stuck on the warmth of analog and vintage gear. But as far as performance is concerned do you, what do you value from your performance? Do you ever go and change the velocity of something that you thought you were doing it with your fingers or change the sounds of something that ... Or do you ... Are you really dedicated to getting it right with your fingers in the performance? Wally Badarou It’s a combination. Actually, are you talking about live performance? Audience Member No, I’m talking about like your productions. For you is that something that you focus more on getting a performance right, like, if it’s not right. Do you go and play it again? Or do you like fix it in the computer now that you’re using a computer? Wally Badarou I do just as much as you do. The issue is I can play keyboard to a certain extent. I’m glad I can do that. It really helps a lot. Yet, I know that at some stage it’ll be preferable to keep the magic of the past that I did and just fiddle with things like the velocity, the filters, and everything afterwards. So I do just as much as you do. It’s just that it all really depends on how. It’s all a question of how much I spend actually doing the main substance. Yeah, I can be fast on that, but see I’ve seen Herbie Hancock once in the studio doing a pass on a Manu Dibango album. Everybody was like, “Wow listen to this!” One take. He’s got it. And the man was not happy. “No, no way, you’re not going to keep this. I need to re-do it. Please let me do it again. I mean it’s just so bad let me do it again.” He did it fifteen times and at the end of that the thing was dead, even him. You know Herbie Hancock, as big, as great as he is, was capable of destroying his own work. Luckily enough, we kept the first take. Now we all have to learn, OK? I can still improve my playing just as much as you. Probably, I mean don’t know but, you know I do not consider myself the best keyboard player ever. I have things that can work that I know how to do and I can achieve quicker than other people, but I still have to work on it. Yeah. Wally Badarou Yes? Audience Member About the creation of the melody, does it generally come from your voice? Wally Badarou Nowadays, yes. Most of what I did in the past came from the keyboard. Out of playing and jamming and just practicing. I would spend hours just practicing. No aim, nothing in sight other than just feel good about keeping my fingers unrested. And an idea would pop up and I would capture that and that would be it. Then, I would develop on it later as I said earlier on. Nowadays, I’m more into developing ideas from within or from guitar. I can play some guitar as well. Ideas that I get from playing guitar are very, very different from the ideas that I get from the keyboard. Very different, because the guitar somehow I do not master as much as I do keyboards, and also it’s definitely more basic. So melodies… Oh, can I play something? Benji B Please. Wally Badarou Quick Wally, people are waiting. People are waiting. They’re not going to wait any longer. [mumbles] There it is. (music: Wally Badarou – unknown) This is a soundtrack. There is no keyboard in it, only strings, guitars, and my voice. Very different. [applause] Thank you. Audience Member You didn’t tell us and Mary anything about your work statement in France, but let me search up Michael Maslow. Wally Badarou Oh yes. Audience Member What kind of work would you do with him and what. All the works you would do in France… Wally Badarou In France ... Audience Member You also told. Self-production is hard and is it harder to work with a guy who is a self producer? Wally Badarou Oh, no! OK. There are two questions in your question, okay. Yeah, the work that I did with the French people are known to the French, most of the time, because it’s in the French language. I worked in Los Angeles with a singer called Alain Chamfort and Serge Gainsbourg was doing the lyrics. That’s how we worked together on that project. And, working with a self-producer, that’s a very interesting question because that’s what I want to do. Today I’m interested in self-productions because I believe that there is nothing more exciting than people who know that what they have to do, they have to do it by themselves first. And then, get somebody else in to just balance some of the decision, some of the direction, just make sure that they are into something. Audience Member How do you feel if you are working with someone? Wally Badarou Yes. Absolutely. Actually, that comes from the fact that I do not believe that as a producer I should be doing the down work, which is programming the drums and all that. That to me is not just producing. This is writing. So if we’re talking about collaborating on the writing level, then fine. Let’s do that. But it’s a much longer process. If you’re talking about producing, I mean, I’m not going to play anything other than just some icing you want a bit of my personal touch here and there. I would be glad to do that. But, I shouldn’t be doing the core of your work. That’s your right. Audience Member You started talking about co-production and the line... Wally Badarou Yeah, the line is very thin between the two. And actually, I do more core production in that respect, nowadays. So if you have anything that you want to show to me and you want me to be core producing with you, please. [laughs] I’ll be down to do that. It means to me ... As long as you know that sometimes my share of the work can just be, “OK, OK, what you’re doing is great you don’t need to do more, keep it that way, let’s go and release it.” If you’re ready to take that from me, if you’re ready to take that word from me, then we can work together. But, if you believe that I have to actually go and analyze and put everything, tear everything apart before you have something out, there’s no point calling me. That’s how I work with Salif Keita. Salif Keita has a band, a fantastic band. He said “Wally, we want you to come in here and have a listen, what do you think?” And I said, “This is great. Don’t touch it. Let’s go in the studio, you want to do it?” “Yes, lets do it!” I did virtually nothing else than refrain people from overplaying. That’s all I did. That was my production. [applause] Thank you. {to audience member] Go ahead. audience member You space it out into the main product. A lot of respect for the space. Is that something like [inaudible] or is it like, you know come back in after the vocal is done? Wally Badarou You’re talking about the studio work that... audience member Yeah. Wally Badarou If I understand your question. audience member Sorry. Wally Badarou Yes. You’re trying to figure out... audience member It seems like you have a great spec for the written section in space. Wally Badarou Yes. Well it’s something that is natural to me. I mean, I don’t, I like to be more precise. When I first started, I was a very busy keyboard player. I would play everything, put clavinets everywhere, I would just fill the tape with just takes, OK? I was a clavinet guy, you know I used to [sings a beat]. I wouldn’t leave one little thing. And I realized that I was going the wrong way. I realized it and what helped me realize that was those guys, “Private Life,” Sly & Robbie. Loads of space. Now, I must say something here to the memory of that guy. His name was Alex Sadkin. He engineered those fantastic albums: Nightclubbing, Warm Leatherette, Joe Cocker, Sheffield Steel, Talking Heads. All those things were engineered by that guy and what that guy did was even before MIDI was invented which allowed us today to be able to sit back and listen to things that are almost already mixed. This guy, out of the tape machine was capable of putting almost finished mixes every time. Each time. So, when I was working I had almost the finished version already. The drums, the bass sounded magnificent before I even started putting my keyboards, when I did “Private Life” overdubs. That way, I knew that I didn’t have to fill things, you know. We used to do that a long time ago where you only have the proper rough mix, so you did not know where you stood, right? So, you would just fill the tape, just in case. You know, just in case we need something here, let me put it. That’s wrong. I mean, to me it seems wrong today. Right? Nowadays, it’s easy to figure that out because it’s so easy to have the great sound right out the box. But in those days, it was... So I made it something very personal that I will always fight for something that would be as sparse as possible. Very, very sober. Benji B Do we have time to play a quick example of that? Yeah, we can’t finish without playing a bit of this and I think that this is a beautiful example both of your point and also the talk about engineering and sonics. (music: Grace Jones – “Nightclubbing” / applause) Wally Badarou Thank you. Well the sound was pretty much there when we did it all the way through in the control room. So it was... Yeah. I mean, Alex Sadkin, he did it. He changed my life, in a way, because he helped me understand that you didn’t need to just crowd things up. If you have it, it’s there, and it’s large, it’s wide, and it helps having all the dynamic coming through. That’s key. Benji B Anymore, for anymore? Audience Member I also noticed you saying you make your own sounds and what have you and you’ve been doing this for a long time. I was wondering if you have like a catalog of your own sounds, like a pamphlet or whatever you put it. You start up from scratch with a sine wave or whatever it might be to get the sound you want to. Wally Badarou Both ways, actually. I have a catalog of things. Definitely. But, I try as much as possible not to use it. It will depend on the emergency. [chuckles] The degree, I mean degree of emergency. If I’m asked to do something quick for advertising and stuff, obviously I won’t be spending much time developing sound from scratch. But, as much as possible I try to avoid it because I try to avoid repeating myself. As much as I understand that it is a trademark that I can benefit from, and still I’m always trying to do something new to make the challenge. The beauty of the thing is each trip is a new trip. No matter how much times I go through the same channel or I wanted to make it different. Audience Member Do you always try to make little signatures to make sure... Wally Badarou No. Never. Never, ever. It comes just naturally. This certain type of ego that I’m trying to avoid actually what matters is the beauty of the music. No matter, regardless of who that is for. Whether it’s for me or for somebody else. I’m looking to serve the music first. Inevitably, I will have a trademark being developed down to process. I don’t have to fight for it. Because there’s a certain type of sound that I like. Yes? Audience Member This is my last question. [giggles] Sorry, I was so fascinated with that last track like as far as the depth of the keyboard and where things sit in the mix and I watched you engineer this. As far as reverb is concerned, I mean that’s something that digitally I struggle with constantly. With your sounds, are you recording room sounds that you’re adding in as well? Or do you use a reverb unit that software that you prefer, it’s probably one of the most criticized that’s inside computers. Wally Badarou In those days we were not working with software. It was all analog. The long AMT Lexicon 24480. Yes, Alex Sadkin use of live room reverb and added outboard reverb as well to the thing. It’s a matter of ears, it’s a matter of balance, it’s a matter of how you feel about what you have. It’s about the very fabric of the sound itself prior to adding the reverb, so it has to do with how Sly would hit the snare drum. Oh, yes. And he has a very distinct way of doing it, believe me. Which is not the same as Tony Thompson, the drummer of Duran Duran would have on the Power Station would have his own way of doing things. You won’t be in the same room as Tony Thompson. When he hits the snare drum, you better be far, far away. It was just massive. Reverb, like production, depends on what material you have to deal with at first. Benji B Are you going to be able to hang around a bit this evening if people have got more things… Wally Badarou Oh yeah that’s great. Definitely. Benji B Because we’re gonna have to wrap it up now, but I’m sure there’s more, much more that people want to come up and ask you personally. I must say at this point please don’t go anywhere because Gerd is going to come and talk to you about the RBMA radio, but I must say, on behalf of absolutely everybody in the room and myself, thank you so much for making the trip from London, thank you for sharing your time and wisdom, Mr. Wally Badarou. Wally Badarou Thank you.

Wolfgang Voigt (2008)
Founder of Cologne institution Kompakt and heralded as a frontrunner of the minimal techno movement, Wolfgang Voigt has made his mark on the world of electronic music. Inspired by the acid house explosion of the late ’80s he heard while in London, Voigt began producing music as Mike Ink and in 1993 co-founded the record store Delirium in Cologne, which eventually became Kompakt, a name with global cachet. With over 160 releases and more than 30 aliases to his name, Voigt is the definition of prolific. He is also eloquent and insightful, with an unmistakable passion for the music he has built his life around.
In this lecture at the 2008 Red Bull Music Academy, Voigt talked about the similarities between German forests and a packed club, pared-back production techniques and why minimal music is nothing without that human touch.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt Most of you will know him as probably the hardest-working man in the techno business, please welcome Mr. Wolfgang Voigt. Now, sorry for you lot that don’t speak German because we decided on short notice that for comfort reasons we do this in German and subtitles will be on page 320. Actually, we might have to go back to German now and then, to use the odd word, and we’ll try to translate them as best as possible. We have this tendency to come up with these nice little terms that sum up so much in about three syllables, and we found the English language not as efficient. Wolfgang Voigt Funky enough. Torsten Schmidt Oh, we’re going into the deep water straight away. So, when we were telling you on the first day that this is also a place where people come together and talk about things, even though they see each other every single day on the way to getting their milk, to yoga, to God knows what, getting their vodka at night, this is another occasion. Wolfgang, you’re actually one of the really few people that live in the quarter of Cologne that actually are from Cologne. Now, when you have visitors over to make them understand why the city runs the way it does, where do you take them usually? Give us a little tour. Wolfgang Voigt Well, I take them to my quarter. Where I live, it’s very easy because, you know, the territory is very small. When we say everything is very interesting is where you can throw a stone in Cologne. So it’s very easy. It might not be as amazing as people might think it is, because what they might know internationally from the musical side or from the culture side. Because it’s a very fine, but very small territory, you know? And the important part is much smaller than a city, of course. So it’s hard to say. There are just a few places, as you say, a few interesting places, which might not be the places that everybody expects. Big discotheques, or amazing big areas, where interesting new music is running the whole day. It’s more like different alternative places, like the yoga place you said. No, like cafes, and of course, our wonderful, let’s say, little tower in the center of Cologne, where we live and where we do all our things together. Me, my friends, my colleagues, all under one roof in a way, and just hanging around in places, which are really close. Some favorite restaurants, some small favorite clubs – but not a big thing compared to, let’s say, to Berlin, for example, Cologne is a village, in a way. It’s a very nice and fine village, but it’s a village, you know? Torsten Schmidt Where do you take them for tourists’ things? Wolfgang Voigt To the cathedral, of course, to the galleries. No, I would say, if we have visitors, or friends business-wise, first of all you show them around in your own house, in your own territory and then you bring them to your favorite restaurant and to a few pubs. There is a certain interesting tradition in Cologne, where the music we stand for, and also the minimal techno scene or the ambient scene, it’s much more played in pubs, for example, than in clubs. Because the situation from the architecture side is very difficult in Cologne. Venues are very expensive. They close very fast and on the other hand, there is a certain contradiction in the Cologne tradition. There hasn’t been so many good clubs that people might expect from the musical side, which we have. But from time to time, when there are good places and good clubs, they might not be open for so long, because on the other side, Cologne people are very special and very lazy, in a way. They all want to go out inside the center in a way and don’t want to go too far to places, compared to Berlin, for example, where people every night travel many kilometers by trams or taxi to go to their favorite clubs. In Cologne this tradition is different. They’re used to go very close, next door to the pubs with few people, hanging around. Secret places, that are not so well-known, drink their wonderful Kölsch, which is a local beer in Cologne, and just hang around in pubs listening to this kind of music… and some dancefloors are full with just ten or 15 people. Torsten Schmidt A lot of talk, less sweat, then. Wolfgang Voigt Sorry? Torsten Schmidt A lot of talk, less sweat. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, both. First talk, then sweat. Torsten Schmidt What does the visitor have to do, that you’d take them to the city forest? Wolfgang Voigt Sorry? Torsten Schmidt What does the visitor have to do, that you’d take them to the Stadtwald or the Königsforst, or something? Wolfgang Voigt What does he have to do? Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Wolfgang Voigt Maybe just ask me to bring him there. It depends, I don’t know how many people are interested to come into a city and to see a forest because, first of all, this seems to be like a contradiction, you know? Especially, I guess, you asked me because people might know that I got a certain interest in forests and especially in the forest around Cologne. Like, in every big city there is also a nearby forest, which I used to spend my free time in to get inspired for my work, in a way. But normally, I’m not so much into inviting people to go there, because this is just a private space of inspiration, you know? It’s nothing so public, even if it’s official and everybody can go there. Torsten Schmidt So, it’s really a special one when, you know, “I’m going with Wolfgang to the forest.” Wolfgang Voigt You have to do a lot for it, but I don’t want to tell you [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless, Cologne is a relatively green city, due to various historical occurrences, and there’s been a strong fascination with Germans and their forests for quite a bit now. Now, I understand that you have been looking into that for quite a bit as well. Could you probably enlighten us what the role of the forest is in German mythology, maybe? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, it’s hard to say. On the one side, I’ve got a certain personal relationship to this, and on the other side, in cultural history in Germany, there is a certain tradition, which is well-known for coming from the romantic period of the 19th century, of course, where there is a certain romantic idea of art in pictures and in literature, which built this mood of the German forest in a way. Where people, artists, or maybe even writers find their inspiration in the fantastic way, in myths, in fairy tales, of course. Which is also represented in a certain kind of music and in a certain very serious kind of dark and even sometimes nearly depressive music. If you see, for example, the music of Wagner, which is inspired by these impressions in a way, and also some kind of literature out of this time. In a way, it’s still a living tradition. Even some musicians of today still feel inspired by this tradition, on the one side, or it might be even the certain kind of German mentality. People like me, for example, from time to time feel very inspired by the surroundings combined by the idea – based on this historical tradition, on one side, and the personal impression you might have if you just walk through the forest and get inspired by these surroundings to explain your art, your music, your pictures, whatever. Torsten Schmidt Is there some chance already to get something, get to listen to something that’s inspired by the forest? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, should be. I think I got the example of this for you here. It’s, of course, the release under the name of Gas, which is missing one record. Where is it? Ah, OK. Here it is. You can see there is also a forest build-in structure on the sleeve, which is also the idea to show the visual side of the forest in a way of the electronic loop thinking and structural thinking. This is a track, called “Zauberberg”, which is a reference to a book of a well-known writer Thomas Mann. (music: Gas – “Zauberberg” / applause) Wolfgang Voigt There might be two main interesting things to say about this music. Everybody might have heard that on top of the well-known bass drum and the bassline, there are some classical sounds, classical strings and harmonies in full length on top of this music. The one point why it’s so remarkable, why these strings are so much ahead, is to make clear the difference between this kind of music and, let’s say, classical ambient music – for example, like Brian Eno or Kraftwerk – because for me, it is very important to understand that the idea behind this is to imagine that the club and the forest is something that comes together. You should imagine that there is a club situation we all might know from the dancefloor… there is fog, you know? There is only some less light and you can’t really see what it is. What I want to combine here is the idea of getting lost somewhere in the forest with no certain address, you know? Somewhere between trees and leaves and combine this with the idea or the impression you might have when you used to go to dark techno clubs. And for me, it’s important to say that it’s the idea to combine electronic beats and real, old classical music. Not just ambient – so, no electronics, no keyboards – it’s real samples, you know, and it’s the idea to bring the forest into the disco, or the other way around, whatever. To merge it in a very special and fantastic way. Torsten Schmidt Now, you’re taking this whole concept live and you already did it in Leipzig. Well, tonight there is another occasion, which is slightly different. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, it’s really different. Me and my wonderful video companion and artist Petra Hollenbach, who is sitting over there, did a wonderful animation of the visual side of my Gas project, which she made into one-and-a-half-hour video, which hopefully everybody will like. We got a chance with this wonderful invitation to play tonight in Park Güell, of course, here in Barcelona. Which is first of all, definitely not a typical place where you imagine this project Gas might be shown, might be happening – because normally it’s a total contradiction, you know? It’s a hall, it has columns and it’s stone, it’s not wood, it’s not a forest. But in a way it’s wonderful, because these columns, you might think, if the visual side will work and if we have a wonderful projection on them, it might hopefully look like a forest tonight. It’s interesting to find out how this show, this music, this whole atmosphere, and, of course, the pictures might work in this venue. Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless, Gaudi was one of these architects that put great emphasis, like a 150 years before it became fashionable, to build environmentally friendly and to integrate nature in the building, as weird as it may seem, especially when you live in Cologne. Wolfgang Voigt Sorry, once again? Torsten Schmidt Especially, when you live in Cologne, like architecture-wise, there is this thought of integrating nature into man-made structures, in a way. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah? You think this is very representative in Cologne? Torsten Schmidt No, not at all, that’s what I mean. Wolfgang Voigt [Laughs] OK, yeah. Yeah, it is hard to say. It depends on what you make out of it. I don’t see so much contradiction between architecture and nature. I see these borders flowing in a way, you know? Not that hard, like black and white. Even in this music, for me, it’s nice and it’s very serious sometimes in the same moment. It’s friendly, but it’s also tired, sometimes in the same moment. This is the same contradiction in the material you use, or the projection you use, so for me it’s what I see, what I make out of it. Torsten Schmidt How do you deal with time during these kind of tracks, because they do take a little bit of space? Wolfgang Voigt Hmm, you mean the length of the tracks? This music is meant to be very, yeah, let’s say hypnotic, narcotic, in a way. It takes the time, and you as a listener should have the time to listen to it. The question is interesting, because people might know, of course, I am coming from techno and techno used to get faster in the ’90s, harder, you know? The patterns went shorter and shorter, and people lose their passion even more and need more information and the music goes faster and faster, and this goes back to a very relaxed tradition of music, which is really hypnotic, it’s relaxed and it takes time. Normally, it doesn’t make sense to step through these kind of records. Normally, you should start at the beginning and listen to the end and then you might know what it’s all about. But I don’t think we have 15 minutes per side to find this out. Torsten Schmidt At the same time you’re using very little elements in there, but at the same time it’s a pretty maximal sound. I mean, there is not much space left in the frequency spectrum in it. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, it’s filled. It’s minimal and it’s maximal at the same time. I think, it’s very overloaded minimal, if you like. It’s minimal in that way, because it’s just a few little elements and the beat – as long as there is a beat, not all these tracks have beats – are going on and on, without too many breaks or variations, or whatever… on top there is very elegiac soundscapes running through, which build their own structures, because I let them run in a way, but only in a certain frame. I control this, because I want to fill the whole room. It shouldn’t be transparent in the end, but minimal at the same time. Torsten Schmidt Back to the reference points. When the Romans came first to Germany – who actually founded Cologne – they wrote about all barbarians sitting in the trees and waiting to give them a good beating. The trees and the woods, that’s all we had for centuries, literally. Wolfgang Voigt Most of the time, yeah. Torsten Schmidt And it became a little bit more prominent when you said the romantic idea was also to create something bigger, a little bit more unifying thing and it was a certain longing, Sehnsucht is the German word, which is a very strong feeling. It’s almost like it was the nation’s puberty, in a way, as far as culture goes. I mean, to a certain degree, you could see parallels between that and what touches people when they start listening to music at age ten, 12 or whatever. Where did you find parallels there? Wolfgang Voigt It’s hard to say. First of all, it’s right what you say, like we already said earlier, that in German tradition and culture there is that certain longing, what certain people think they might find in the forest in a way. But I don’t think that we invented this. It’s just every people all over the world, you know? They’ve got their relationship to their kind of nature and any artist all over the world might some day walk through their natural environment and get inspired by trees, or by the ocean, if you like, or by mountains, or whatever. It might be that especially in Germany there’s such a strong, worldwide well-known tradition, even in literature or in pictures, that it’s very popular to bring this motif of the forest, this idea and this mood into art. I cannot say if even the younger generations, or whatever, that the tradition is going on, that they all go back to this point feeling inspired by this. What I found out – when I re-released this music, which is mainly around ten years old and it has been released half a year ago again – that it was really great to see a lot of very young people, around 18 to 20, compared to my age, they get into this music and they really like it and they take it and understand it – as far as I can see – as it is what it is, what it’s meant to be. Which is a good surprise, if you think of the way people, especially young people listen to music today. If you think of MySpace, YouTube, you wouldn’t combine that first of all with this kind of music. But it’s definitely also happening there, and as far as I understand, they really get into it and they understand it in their wonderful new way. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of wonderful new ways, going back to youth and youthful things, there is a certain parallel in the motives that drove what is happening here [nods to the turntable], and in the same way the stuff that you listened to when you were a teenager, right? Or what were you listening to as a teenager in the first place? Wolfgang Voigt Oh, yeah. I listened to every kind of music. It’s just for my age, it’s a typically long way through the music history. I started listening to and I got educated with German folk music on the one side, glam rock on the other in the early ’70s, and then I go via rock music, I came to jazz. I used to listen to jazz music, later to free jazz music and then I got in touch with new wave and pop music, electronic pop music in the ’80s, before I fell in love with acid house music and techno in the late ’80s. Since then, even still, even the techno is around 20 years old, for me, it’s still the bass drum [that] is steady and it has never changed. And especially the tradition of techno music, music based on four-to-the-floor bass drum took half of my music life… Torsten Schmidt I mean, do you have any idea of how many records you actually did? Wolfgang Voigt No. There are some guys around on MySpace, they know. I don’t know. Not really. A lot. Maybe because I made most of them in the fast times in the ’90s when we all were very inspired, you know? And we were very wild, too, you did a lot of records, which you’re happy you have forgotten today, so this might be the reason, yeah. Too much, I guess! Torsten Schmidt I mean, we tried to count at least the different pseudonyms that you used and the different identities and even there we got past 20, easily. And, I mean, technically that would mean... Wolfgang Voigt Do you know them all? Torsten Schmidt God, I’m not from Russia. Wolfgang Voigt OK. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, there are some enthusiasts around the world who know them all, but that means, if we would just like to present them all, every single one of them for like three minutes, we would be done [for time], just without any talking. Wolfgang Voigt Time would be over. Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, but it might not be necessary to show the whole musical spectrum and the variations I did on this music. I would say like five might be enough to show a relevant spectrum of what I did. There are also lots of funny new names, which not only I used, but also of my friends. In the ’90s, it was like using pseudonyms or identities, which might be really nice and funny even, if you like, for just a few weeks, or just for two releases and then they’re gone. The good thing at this time was that you don’t need to create big identities, you know, just if you feel you want to make this kind of music now, you know? We learned in the ’90s that some kind of musical ideas, or trends or whatever, might only be interesting for a few weeks, and then something new should come. Today, I would say this is different again. It’s going back to more solid and longer terms of ideas of using music, but in the ’90s the short terms were also interesting. Torsten Schmidt But despite the short terms, all those identities were pretty defined. Like, you could pretty much differentiate, “Oh, this is rather a Mike Ink track, or a Studio 1 track,” or something. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, of course. Maybe the difference is, let’s say, fast-working and inspired young techno producers, that some of them might use like ten different names and do ten different records, but they all sound the same. They’ve all only got different names. In my case, it was like I felt really inspired by this music – and also this easy kind of production makes me very fast working in a good way, you know? But I always tried to make a real difference between the project and the names. Of course, like you say, Gas is something different to Studio 1, as you mentioned, for example. You can’t really compare this. There is only one thing that has the same information, which is the bass drum. The rest is different. Torsten Schmidt Do you have an example, which is as contrary to this as possible? Wolfgang Voigt Of course. This is something very different, more fun… Thank you very much. But it’s also very ongoing music, you know? It’s very minimal, so I guess everyone can imagine it’s going on like this more or less. So, we might stop it here to go on with the discussion. Torsten Schmidt I mean, Studio 1 came at an interesting point in time as well. What made you do it, in short? Wolfgang Voigt Well, this record is from ’96, and this was, exactly like you say, it was a very interesting and inspiring time. The mid-’90s, where most of the main things I did and some of my friends did and other people also did, was happening these days, because music was changing very much in Germany. Techno was the big thing in the mid-’90s and all kinds of people from other cultures, rock culture, independent culture, even from the art scene, they came into techno because they felt inspired. Five years later, of course, like the normal techno kid already was from the early ’90s, but it was a great moment, because a lot of interesting people and interesting inspiration came in and yeah, techno gets popular and pop in a good way, these days. Because a lot of, let’s say, good and interesting people from different scenes were coming to this music. When this came up it was one of the very early examples of making techno really minimal. Until this point techno was very hard, and it was already communicated as some kind of minimal and very simple music, but it was not that much minimal. Here, it was a certain kind of… also the arty idea of bringing down, the main techno idea to bring it down to its very basics. To try to invent a music which had as less variation as possible. To strip it down even to the bass drum and rebuild the whole architecture of techno and what we know about techno after the mid-’90s was basically very small and very minimal samples and mostly from very unknown samples – because it was not interesting any more, and it’s stripped down to the most minimal way these days. Because there have been no names, no sleeves, even no titles for the tracks. It was just the whole language, the whole secret language of this kind of music, which started working worldwide in the mid-’90s, was just the most minimal loop information – which was as little information as possible. It was the maximum and the minimum at the same time. And it was, of course, a certain kind of aesthetic, which was very, very strong and tough, which has something to do with very minimal architecture, in a way, you know? And at this point the glamorous side of this music, the popular side, which makes people dance in clubs to this and, let’s say, the more intellectual arty side, if you want, has come together at the historical point and this was the interesting thing at this time. When me and some other people started doing this kind of music, which later got very popular in thousands of variations under the meaning known as minimal techno – which I have to say is the leading club music worldwide. Because like the most of you might know, most techno is working very basically, without any vocals, without any information, just sound. Little noises and structures. Which people understand… Torsten Schmidt Yeah, it’s a pretty archaic, not a ritual, but an archaic mechanism, I guess. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, it was meant to be as pure as possible. Me, for example, I had an idea to make it as radical as possible. Until the mid-’90s, techno was getting louder, harder, faster, bigger and even less transparent. And then there was a point when it didn’t go much more ahead, and you had to go somewhere and the idea was to strip it down back again to the basic information, which is the four-to-the-floor bass drum, nothing else. And then to rebuild very carefully and control every sound. Just one hi-hat, one clap, one sound, nothing less. The idea was not to use more than three ingredients. If there would come a fourth element, then you’ve done something wrong. You have to tell them an interesting story in about ten minutes, with just three ingredients. Like, let’s say, very minimal soup, which needs only three ingredients, in a way. My idea was to find something like the beautiful art of nothing, or the art of leaving out, if you understand. The art of being really minimal. To explain a story, a full surrounded story with nearly no elements. The interesting thing was to make this music funky and working and danceable with what you have not said in your music and not what you put on it – more what you leave out. Torsten Schmidt A term you coined at the time was “die Endeuphorisierung des Tanzbodens,” which translates like ”the de-euphorising the dancefloor,” or something like that. Wolfgang Voigt What you meant was I think some ideas we had at this time, were to leave out the certain kind of too much hysteric energy of the dancefloor. To make funkiness more mathematic, in a way. Not so much like beating on the drum until everybody is tired. Like, leaving out, like being very organized. It was more like smart techno, like staying cool. It was cool and it was danceable, but it was more like finger snapping – it was not so much hands in the air and it was not even sweaty any more. This is what I meant at this time, but it was just a beginning of an idea. I am happy to say that the direction that this music takes was very much after this time. It was very much euphoric again, and today people really get hysteric to very, very minimal music. Just to the bass drum and one noise, and this for me is the main information on techno with really nothing, just signals that only a few people might understand on the dancefloor, you have so much effect on it and feedback, of course. Torsten Schmidt A lot of your work is about dealing with contradictions and living through paradoxes. There is always like antagonism to the one thesis and trying to somehow find out what is in the middle. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, of course. Someone said that the most constant thing in my work is a contradiction, in a way. This is why I used so many project names, because you’re searching for something, maybe in music or in art and when you find it, then you got it. And then you have to stay away from it and look for something else, even the opposite to make this musical idea more clear. And so this is contradiction is also a style element, in a way. This, for example, is very minimal and transparent. When you did it, directly after you might look for something which is the opposite, which is really not transparent. It’s really fat and big, because the contradiction between the flanging in between, if you like, is an interesting thing, you know? You’re looking for something and sometimes what you search for is not exactly on the point when you try to find somewhere beside, you know? I would explain it like, you’re looking for certain rules and the moment you find these rules, you break them. And then it’s interesting enough, because then it’s wild again. You’ve got an idea what you’re looking for, but then you’re looking for a certain point when you don’t understand it really any more. And then it’s interesting. So sometimes, the main truth to a certain idea in art for me is beside of the middle. It’s not exactly that. When I said, “I’m looking for the absolutely black, or the total beat,” then it’s the only way to search for it that is the interesting thing. When you find it, you got it and then it is not interesting any more. So you keep this in motion. There is a kind of “doing a documentary” of the way you’re searching for [something]. What I want to show is not what I found, but what I’m looking for, what I’m searching for. So this is always on the way. It is never there, because this is much more interesting. It keeps you alive, in a way. Torsten Schmidt Another one of these eternal quests is, you can call it “Mensch Maschine” or electronic funk, or this whole dichotomy between having this calculated thing and the funk/soul aspect, which is rather the total opposite of it. Now, how are you dealing with those two poles? Wolfgang Voigt Both sides, of course, have their truth. When you say the “Mensch Maschine,” for example, we all think of Kraftwerk, which is very quantized machine music, with not so much human elements. For example, if you use references from funk music or from music which is so-called human touch, the interesting thing is to combine it and to make machines human, in a way. So, combining means, you got today in modern music software, you got a lot of buttons that you have to push and then you got a certain kind of human touch. It makes you swing, or it makes you boogie, or whatever, and it’s really groovy, but it’s not really human. The good idea of using the tradition of techno and using the machines, is always to misuse these machines. To animate them to make mistakes, then it might get funky in a way. It might get groovy. Of course, one thing is that a lot of this kind of music is based on samples. Samples from other people’s records, from other peoples’ music, which is hand-made and really grooves and has this typically human touch. And if you combine it with this music, it still has this human touch. But in the end you have to have this feeling, you have to have this groove. You understand, while you do it, you know? It’s even there if you listen to music in clubs – you feel inspired to dance on certain tracks or you don’t. It depends. It’s just feeling. Torsten Schmidt Now, as this music emerged at different places of the planet at around the similar time, for many of the people that started getting into music in the late ’80s or the early ’90s, they were looking very much towards Chicago and to Detroit – and who ironically enough were looking very much into Europe for what they’re doing. So, how did you find your spot on that map? Wolfgang Voigt In the late ’80s until this music was invented, of course mainly in Chicago and Detroit, later in Berlin and so on, there was a very fast move worldwide. You know, techno was a language, which was very fast getting all over the world, and people played back their ideas. There might be a certain record coming from Detroit, which might have been listened to by somebody in Berlin, who felt inspired by this and so on, and back again. It’s really ironically in the late ’80s there was like a lot of people, me too, for example, we really were inspired and impressed, for example, by Chicago acid or Detroit techno. When you met these people first, who were responsible for this music, they even were impressed by what we did, or some people did in Germany or in England, for example. It was really interesting and it was the time, when music runs forward that fast, that the history was not fast enough to give the right... how can I explain it? There was not enough time to bring all these categories together carefully where it comes from. You know, because it was very fast. There came out so many records in those days, that it took a long time later to find out where the roots of something might be, where was it coming from. We used to say at this time that techno is very new, radical, a non-verbal international language, where certain identities, or even pop stars’ identities, or even a certain kind of language, or even nationality, is not necessary any more. There is only musical information, and either you like it or you don’t like it. Or you understand it or you don’t. It was not important so much any more, because these kind of friendly machines, where we used to produce it, gave a lot of people in a very good and democratic way that chance to produce this music, as long as they feel it and as they feel inspired and they got a certain kind of musical talent, of course. Torsten Schmidt I mean, obviously after listening to glam rock, etc., which is just a little bit about the main ego there on stage that totally buries it all, there is something, as you said, pretty radical about this stance of taking the persona totally back and creating some sort of avatar character that just acts so that you just have some sort of information to differentiate things. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, yeah. Until techno, in pop history it was really necessary to understand the instrument and to have a certain identity, to have a certain knowledge. You have to build an image, and you have to convince a mighty record company what you did to bring out the record. You know, with techno it changed radically, because people start with really less money and easy alternative, radical and anarchistic ways to produce their music. They don’t care any more about what people said. They just did it on their own, they press a thousand records, you know, which started to get affordable at these days and so this makes the music market very wide, wild and radical, and makes all these old structures not necessary any more. You don’t need companies, or some big guys in the record industry, who will tell you that your musical idea is worth bringing out or not. They just did it and this frees a lot of people all over the world and inspired people, “Hey, this is really great, I can do this on my own,” you know? And it makes an idea of the free-flowing inspiration of art in a way which has never been like this before. You know, just because the production is getting easier, getting more alternative, and most of all people don’t care so much about sales any more, they just want to do this music, no matter if they get their money back or not. Fun was much more important than, let’s say, selling records or whatever. And this was really good for the music. Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless, the market was big enough so that all these different characters somehow could afford at least to press the record, more or less. Nevertheless, sales were big enough that if certain characters pressed the record, even in small amounts, it was enough to go and do the next one. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, it was just a non-profit thing, it was just because of the music. You know, you could be happy if the money you spent on the record you did maybe let’s say last month comes back to afford the next one. Torsten Schmidt Obviously, you had to learn a lot of these things, as far as the production process goes. Can you still recall the tribulations of pressing your first one or two records? Wolfgang Voigt The first one was really an adventure, yeah. When we started producing our own records in the very early ’90s, at the beginning it was a bit more like an adventure, you know? I remember we had to do it all on our own, do the mastering and go to the certain pressing plants, and it was, yeah, it was a lot of jobs to do in the early beginning. But it started getting easier because there were structures built very soon in the early ’90s – even distribution, production plants and studios, which made it a lot easier, because there was a certain kind of worldwide alternative market started, which makes all these things possible. In the beginning, it might be a bit difficult – you have to learn a few things to do this all on your own, because before there were a lot of people between you, your music and the production of music. And then you start doing it all on your own… But it was a very fast thing that people learnt these days and just with a little bit of knowledge and a little bit of strength and power, you could do it on your own. Torsten Schmidt I do sense a bit of euphemism in there, because I mean, you kind of refined it to a stage where even in this building the people that haven’t ever heard consciously one of your records would know about Kompakt as a label, or Kompakt as the mini empire. Now, it’s kind of a harsh reality, that in this independent market, you have to put in a lot of effort to get to a certain stage. And then, as soon as you get to a bare minimum, where you can live off it, like all the haters are coming down on you again. And you’re like, “Oh, hang on, we’re just trying to give people jobs here in a way with what they’re doing.” Can you take us in like a short installment of the process of how you learned to integrate all these things in your own house, literally? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, when you first see yourself as an artist, or as a musician, and then at a certain point things happen that we spoke about and you make a decision to produce – to make your music free, to produce on your own, take your own risks and try to involve as less people as possible in the production and even in the outside of music. Yeah, then one day you have to make a decision and then you make your first tries and then you build your first label, of course. Let’s say, we, me and my partners, my friends, we have been involved in this music since the very beginning, so we have always set up the parallel to the whole movement from the very beginning. And it was in a very natural way we built up our own label, our own company. And, step by step, we built all these departments because we found out it’s really better to do it on your own and not to involve too many people. Because it’s easier, because you got a very hard break-even point on those kind of productions. So less people involved, the better it goes to protect your production and even your money, if you like. So, you slowly build up your record company, in a way, and start thinking about the business side of these things because you have to be organized, otherwise you cannot afford to do your own music. So you have to get in contact, or to build certain structures even of marketing, of publishing, of licensing and all these things, which might sound also boring, in a way, because these was all these points that you want to run away from, because you don’t want to get in touch with so many music-business people, you want to do music. On the other side, you have to learn on the point that you have to do these things and to learn these things in a certain way, even in another way, like generations before, an alternative way just to survive in this music. In the ’90s when this music got popular and DJ culture was really big, and vinyl gets a strong market and there was a worldwide DJ and dance market coming up, we have been lucky to be a part of it, with our special Cologne department and our Cologne idea. We’ve been involved in the international techno from the very beginning, but we always had this idea to find our own sound in the borders of techno. We always said, “There is a typically Berlin sound, a Detroit sound, a Chicago sound – why shouldn’t there be a Cologne sound?” So, for us, especially for me, it was important to invent a known slang in this international music language techno, we tried to find our, what we call, “Cologne slang.” Like others found their Frankfurt slang, or the Detroit slang, or whatever. And at the end we found out that was the best what we could do because people really mentioned that we didn’t try to copy other peoples’ music, or not to try to sound like Detroit, or whatever. We tried to take this wonderful inspiration, we took this ball coming from Detroit and kicked it back with a certain kind of Cologne attitude or whatever. And this brings us a good feedback and real respect from the other side of the world. So, this is, I guess, why labels could work when they find their own style, their strategy and their own kind of music. Torsten Schmidt Can you recall certain key moments when you understood, like, “OK, there is no sense trying to be Juan Atkins or, God knows, Larry Heard –I can do only Wolfgang”? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, for me as an artist, I went to discotheques, I went to galleries and I felt inspired. As an artist, you need inspiration, of course. You get into clubs, you listen to something and with this idea of the last night you go into studio the next day… But yeah, it depends. There are a lot of techno producers who really are brilliant in sounding like this one, or that one, and they’re doing it in a good way. And it is also possible in techno to work like this, but for me it was always the other way around. I never had an idea to copy anybody’s music in that way. Of course, there is a certain sound, there are rules, there are certain kinds of instruments. If you use an 808, for example, a drum machine, or you use a certain machine, like whatever, like a 303 or today, if you use Ableton, if you like, of course, there are similarities in the sound. If you take the same sound, of course, you sound like somebody else. But it is not important that there are certain elements in the music which sound like somebody else, it’s important what comes on top. What is your own part in your music, what do you make out of it? Also, it’s not important who you sample, it’s important what you make out of this sample. I’m happy to say that in techno, there are a lot of people who might not really understand this in a full way, but they understand by heart that there is something very special in this music that somebody has their own idea in their own musical language. But this was not a strategy I might have some day or for somebody else, it’s just my nature, you know? Torsten Schmidt Now, people do learn generally a lot through emulating things, and so as a good German, you now and then try to… doing music that moves you in the hip region isn’t exactly our most nature-given thing. I mean, Germans by nature aren’t the funkiest people on the planet. Wolfgang Voigt Of course not, no. Torsten Schmidt If you look at the body of your work, you dealt with it quite offensively and went through like very particular elements that are as far away from the funk as possible, and try to incorporate them into a dancefloor scenario. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? Wolfgang Voigt Funkiness is a very special thing. We had, also in the ’90s again, we had a lot of discussion about... Torsten Schmidt Damn those ’90s… Wolfgang Voigt Damn those ’90s… like, what is funky? Funky is a certain kind of rhythm and feeling, of course. First of all, funk is black music, coming out of the disco tradition from the late ’70s, but it’s just to explain a certain kind of groove. You can be funky with machines, of course. Today you got plug-ins with certain patterns – they’re funky, because the software is programmed like that, you know? So it’s hard to say where is the border of being funky. Of course, a lot of my music has been funky in a way, or people thought it was funky. There is a lot of ways of being funky, you know? It’s hard to say – still the bass drum is steady and it’s very mathematic. There are more mathematic, let’s say more German, groove ideas like we might know from Kraftwerk, for example, combined with funkiness. If you just scratch around with beats and listen to it, then you see if you cooperate with the sample and your machines right, then it might get funky very fast, just by accident, or by influencing or pushing machines to make certain kinds of mistakes. So, grooves get laid back and so we are very fast into funky music, which does not mean, for example, me like not funky, normal German, I play bass – educated like a funky bass player from, you know, from the human side here. It’s combined with machines. Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless, this is probably an interesting point, not everyone learned to play jazz in somewhere near the southern states near the Mississippi, or the blues, or whatever, and most of us here come from somewhere else than where the music that they idolize is actually coming from. What are the tactics in doing you and putting your own influences and your own identities in there? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, with sampling, for example, with the production way of sampling, you can use the whole music history in a way – even, if you like, in a respectless way. Like, a big supermarket where everything is available. Of course, we all are influenced and educated by English and American pop music from the ’70s and ’80s, and these were the main influences, of course. In the end, when you start doing your own music, me, for example, I never tried to be like my idols from the ’70s or ’80s, or whatever. As you already said, I tried to combine it with my own ideas and tried to mix traditions and styles and also I always tried to mix contradictions. For example, let’s say funky-based music, coming from disco music from the ’80s or ’70s combined with, let’s say, even with German Schlager or Volksmusik, which inspired me to combine the music which is normally forbidden to combine, or it might be a certain contradiction, which you might not understand. Torsten Schmidt You would need to elaborate on Schlager or Volksmusik because they’re probably not the most well-known terms around the world. Wolfgang Voigt Not the most well-known terms, yeah, of course, yeah. I heard that the term Schlager or the term kitsch, for example, is a very well-known term. Yeah, it is typically German language-based pop music, which my parents used to listen to. I don’t know what an English world is for Schlager because I understand why this term is not existing in a way in the international music language. Even, let’s say, like marching music or maybe like polka music, or folk music, even though the influences might not fit techno or funky music. But for me from time to time it was interesting to combine these tendencies, which are normally full of contradiction. Torsten Schmidt On the interesting side... Wolfgang Voigt How would you explain German Schlager music to the people? Torsten Schmidt I think, it’s not really... Wolfgang Voigt Unfortunately, I have no listening examples of this kind of music, which I might play to you. Torsten Schmidt But I guess it’s probably, I don’t know, adult pop music, in a way? Wolfgang Voigt Sorry, what? Torsten Schmidt It’s probably adult pop music in a way. It’s pop music for people that aren’t into youth culture. Wolfgang Voigt It’s pop music for your grandmother, you know? Torsten Schmidt The interesting thing is, I mean, obviously it’s hugely popular and Saturday-night shows are filled with it. And interestingly enough, the steady bass drum, the electronic steady bass drum rules supreme in that genre these days. You can’t listen to any of those Volksmusik shows on TV without getting electronically produced beats in there. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, well, the four-to-the-floor bass drum, it’s existing in any kind of music, even in trivial ways of music and into strange entertainment music, you know? And what we call beer-tent music, for example, and for drinking hymns and whatever, it’s all based on a certain kind of techno. Even the worst and strangest and most trivial things are based on techno beats. Not all of these tendencies are really worth listening to, but some I found are not so uninteresting, in a way, because it also shows how far techno has gone… Torsten Schmidt That’s probably a good way to come back to Studio 1 and some of your older productions. Those were, to a certain degree, almost a political statement as well as for that little irritation that for years people have been fighting to make techno a major force in popular culture. And all of a sudden there it was so popular from those Saturday night evening shows to two million people at Love Parade and walking tampons and giant inflatable mobile phones and all these atrocities. That was like, “Hang on! Is this really what we want?” So before, there was this almost political element to reducing it to strobe light, the fog machine and the bass drum, in a way. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, I’ve always felt that we have to see that every musical trend has to move forward in a way to stay interesting. On the one side, of course, techno comes from very underground. It was very pure, minimal for a certain kind of so-called well-known people, or the ones that have been there. It was very alternative, minimal, radical, and at the beginning it was just strobe lights, bass drum and a few people and then it’s getting more and more popular. I would say, when the direction techno takes, when it gets more into pop music and it gets to a very… even into Love Parade, to two million people dancing on the street to techno. In the very beginning for me it was a good direction, because it was the music we stand for and it was good to see how popular it could get. Of course, the more popular any music trend gets, you know, the more problems come. The more people get involved, also the more silly people maybe get involved, of course. But after all these years when techno has been very commercial, it has also shown very strange and, let’s say, very ugly sides of getting popular, but it still exists, for me it’s not new any more, but it’s still the most important kind of dance music worldwide. I think that techno is still very vast, still able to get back to its roots again and again – to get stripped down back to the underground, to the basic only, to the bass drum and invent itself new every few years. Not that it’s much any more like in the early years, of course, but if you see other musical trends or tendencies, like I don’t know, rock music or whatever, they never been refreshing and getting underground again and again like it is with techno music. That’s my feeling. Normally, after 20 years, a musical trend is definitely dead and it’s only established. Techno for me is established on one side, but it’s still the most radical dance music available. This might be only because there is nothing new really that comes instead. Normally, after a trend, the next trend comes. For me, in the musical history, techno was the last cultural trend which mobilized a lot of people worldwide. And so at the moment we got to the point that it’s not new any more in a way, and there might be a lot of people who stay away. But there is nothing newer available. There is no alternative. I like to say after techno always comes techno. Torsten Schmidt So jumping 12 years back to the first Studio 1 releases, you’re quoted as saying, “After six years of producing music technically and aesthetically everything is said and done – it’s just about the refining it.” Now, this is 12 years later, so twice the time... Wolfgang Voigt At this point you mentioned, for me after a few years of getting really inspired from a lot of records and a thousand variations, there was a point that from my side that everything was said and done in this music. Which does not mean that I was not interested any more, it was just that I wanted to stop my creativity in a way and fix on another point. And I got interested in the marketing side and building up the label and the business side, which was also a big chance. And it was interesting for me after years of only doing music, getting a bit more organized.
Also pushing a lot of young artists, young producers, which surrounded me in these days and sent wonderful inspiring demos which were based on this kind of tradition in the kind of new techno music, which I wanted to do like this, because I felt like I’d already did it. Also, I found enough fresh energy and fresh ideas in younger peoples’ techno productions, which I – me and my friends – decided to push and to bring forward and to release on our label Kompakt, in Cologne. And for a few years, I concentrated just on creating a certain frame, a platform for other people’s music, but it still was techno and it still was progressing, and it was still coming up with new ideas from fresh young producers. Even if it was only a new generation of software and a new generation of the way they produce, there were still enough things to say. It was not that glamourous any more and not that radical and new and revolutionary like it has been years before – but it was still the most revolutionary option we might have. Because for me it was never the question to go back to jazz or to rock music. Torsten Schmidt Did you at any stage or moment where you thought like, “Oh damn, I used to be Mike Ink, the producer, and now I have to be Wolfgang, the business person”? Wolfgang Voigt As we said already before, my career has been full of contradictions, so it was not really difficult for me. I could combine this all in one person, all under one roof. So it was really not a problem. Torsten Schmidt But earlier, when you started elaborating on this, I saw a few alarm bells going off, like, “Damn I want to be a producer. I want to be at my studio, doing my thing and – contracts, Excel sheets, all that stuff – can someone else please take care of this?” Wolfgang Voigt No. At a certain point, yes. After all, I’ve done this and I found out how to handle Excel sheets and statements and whatever you want and I fell in love with the bureaucratic side of music. It was really interesting for me for a certain time, because I handled it in a way like art. In a way, for me it was like... Yeah, I did it with the same energy I used to do my music. Before I used to handle these more boring things and all these Excel things, like you say. Until a certain point, every period needs its certain time. I really felt inspired and had to say a lot of these things, it was fun with my friends to build these companies, these structures and on top of this give a lot of people the chance and the platform to bring out their wonderful music. But then a certain point comes, when I said now it’s enough. Meanwhile, I was surrounded by good people who supported and helped me like it is in the traditional companies – you get bigger and there are people who might come in and do this job much better than you, organizing all this paperwork and other stuff, which gives me the chance to follow my upcoming feeling again to get back to my creativity and get back to my music. When the break was long enough, your creativity comes back and your ideas come back and the need and the strength and the power to go back to your own music. When it’s strong enough it finds a way, and then there is only one way to go back to your music. Torsten Schmidt When you’ve ever found yourself surrounded by businessmen, or in one room full of businessmen, you’d be surprised how many times you hear the word “creative.” And everyone is like an artist in there. Can you run a company creatively? Wolfgang Voigt Of course, of course, business and creativity for me is no contradiction. It goes very well together. I’ve been always very creative while also being a businessman, you know? Because this is where my energy comes from, you know? I never started being interested in some sort of business thing and it was never my main goal just to rule a successful company, just for business, or just for money, you know? I would say, yes, we have been successful in what we did – because we said music comes first and then comes money. Of course, it’s important if you want to have a free and successful company, you have to understand some certain business things. Of course, it’s important. But it’s not the main thing. The main thing is to understand music and to understand how to handle music. Torsten Schmidt Can you probably give us an idea of the way we are now? Take us on the virtual tour through that building that the people on the streets of Cologne call ”Der Bunker.” Wolfgang Voigt ”Der Bunker”? Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Wolfgang Voigt You mean from the business side, from our building. Torsten Schmidt No, let’s just say we open the door, what are the things have we got under one roof? Wolfgang Voigt Under one roof. What have we got? Yeah, we got our wonderful company Kompakt, of course, which is for Cologne more or less a wonderful big building in the center of Cologne. Yeah, what he says by “all under one roof” is that we live and work and eat and produce and sell, or whatever, our idea of music. Which means that we got our wonderful record shop downstairs and the distribution, where we handle all the physical techno market with records and CDs. We got a big creative floor on the first floor with all our offices, with all our departments, booking and licensing, label work, artwork. All these things. Production. Yeah, and then we got a wonderful communication at the second floor, where we got our kitchen, where we all come together around like 20 people, who are working for us, in our still alternative music company. Yeah, on top of the roof, we got our living areas, of course – more like a factory. I would say a factory, where living and working comes together, without any certain borders. And in the basement we got our top-secret production studios where we still try to invent new music all the time. Torsten Schmidt It looked like someone was trying to break into those studios because I think for about two years there were big diggers constantly, right in front of the building. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, we had to do a lot to build the studios, because the architectural situation was very difficult and we had to fix some certain laws with the government, because we had to build some strange things to get allowed to build. The laws you need, especially in Cologne, are very strict and very hard. Torsten Schmidt So, at that stage had you ever have any moments when you were like, “Oh, gosh!”? Wolfgang Voigt Yes, of course. I had more than one time. Sometimes it was really too big, it was too much work and too much unnecessary work. But when it’s done, you know why you did it and then you feel well. Torsten Schmidt OK, but in the second when you can’t really see that it will ever be done, how do you keep going on? Wolfgang Voigt When you’re stuck in the middle of this production process and you see the big diggers standing in front of you, saying like, “Hey, what have you done? Is this techno any more?” But, yeah, you start it and then you get to the middle, and then you just have to do it. Torsten Schmidt Now that studio is finally done, who are you sharing your rooms with? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, I share my room, or we share our rooms, of course, first of all, with our in-house producers at Kompakt in Cologne, which is of course my old colleague Jörg Burger, maybe somebody might know him from his production the Modernist. My brother Reinhard, Michael Mayer, of course, and a guy called Superpitcher that somebody might know, we’re all stuck together in the studios, downstairs in the basement. We all got our rooms and we got the center and a recording room and we got a little bar, which we need, everybody can imagine. And from time to time we got some guests – national guests and international guests – which we produce over there or produce together, just get creative. And we also got real natural instruments in our studio, like real drum kits and real bass and stuff, not only computers. For handmade music. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, there is handmade elements and there is also a little club area as well in one of the rooms. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, in my room there is standing a real club PA. First of all, it’s big fun having your own discotheque in the house. This is always good when you produce music like this and, of course, you need it just for technical reasons, because you need a realistic reference. If you want to produce club music, the best thing you could do is, if you have a chance while you’re producing to listen like it would sound in clubs. Therefore you need a club PA. And the difficult thing is when you live in the center of a private house in the center of a big city, you can imagine you need really special isolated rooms to run a club PA in your rooms, because you got neighbors, you know? Torsten Schmidt Now, Jörg Burger and you are collaborators for quite a while, on and off. And I think the first time people heard about you was when people like Sven Väth and DJs in Berlin as well started to play Burger/Ink records in like, what? ’91 was that? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, right about ’91 we had our first relevant, let’s say, successful record, which DJs, like you mentioned, they really played it. They liked it and it was like the first step in this kind of music where we both, me and Burger, were getting popular with this music, yeah. Torsten Schmidt Getting back to the influences on how you do you… remember this great Jörg Burger quote when he talks about seeing his first 909? You know that story? Wolfgang Voigt Tell me. Torsten Schmidt Ah, OK. I hoped for a first-person account. But I think in essence he tried for quite a while to get certain kinds of drum sounds and a certain punch and so on, and listening to records, and trying to imagine, like, “Uh, what is this thing?” Wolfgang Voigt “How did they make this?” Yeah, when this all started, it was really a secret how certain producers, which we really loved for their records – especially the Detroit producers – how did they do this, you know? And we were wondering in studios trying to find out what kind of machines did they use? Because it was not really known. There was no really communication around, via magazines, for example, and we couldn’t read: “OK, this producer is using this instrument,” like you have it today. Today, if you want to know how a new producer is working, you just look through certain magazines and you know, or to his website, or whatever. But, back in these days it wasn’t possible. It took you a long time to find out how they used it. We tried to do this music, definitely with the wrong instruments and never sounded that good, like our idols, you know? Until, of course, my friend Burger, who was much more involved in instruments and equipment in those days, he found out about legendary Roland machines, like the 303 and the 909, and the first time we touched machines like this it was really like getting in contact with God. Torsten Schmidt I also remember him being slightly disappointed, as in like “What?” Wolfgang Voigt “What, that’s all?” Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, yeah. It was really this little machine makes that wonderful sound, you know? I never was interested so much in learning an instrument. It was not so much my thing, and Jörg said I was too lazy to learn all these manuals and stuff. But the first time I got the 303 and I was a massive acid fan – on the first view it looks complicated, but for me it was totally clear – “You have to learn this, you want to understand this machine” – and I did. I really got disciplined to learn this machine, it was very important. But it was the first time. The time before I used to play drums. Just these sticks and you push on the drums. It was a lot easier, you know? Torsten Schmidt So, how long did it take you to realize, like, “OK, we don’t get that fat, booming 808 or 909 sound, but we might have something of our own that’s worth something”? Wolfgang Voigt You mean before we got these instruments? Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, until the moment we got them and we heard them the first time, we used to go to a studio in Belgium in those days and produce our first tracks and then... Torsten Schmidt How did you find out about that studio in the first place? Wolfgang Voigt We used to work together with a German producer, who lived around the corner and he invested in our creativity and said, “So you want to do this music?” We gave him some demos, and then he found out the right studio, which was the one in Belgium, and he sent us there. And then we got in touch with those legendary machines for the first time. And at the moment you pushed the buttons, you found out that you can never sound like your idols, or anybody else’s record, if you don’t have these machines, because it’s the only way to sound like this. Torsten Schmidt And then, how did you find your own machines? Was it more like techniques and the way you used other things? Wolfgang Voigt These days, these machines would be already what we would call today vintage, you know? You have to check out the secondhand market, because these machines at this time already were a few years old, and the equipment market is really fast, they were already sold out. You couldn’t buy them new in the shops, because they were coming from the early ’80s, from hip-hop music, of course. Yeah, and then you have to check the secondhand market and these instruments are getting very expensive these days – because the guys who got these machines found out that they’re very rare and popular. They don’t get reproduced any more by Roland, for example. So they get very expensive, very fast. Even more expensive in secondhand than the price was when they were new. Torsten Schmidt Now, unlike Jörg, you’re not exactly the biggest gear head in the world. How do you actually use your tools? Wolfgang Voigt Oh, I would say like, very anarchistic… No, it’s hard to say. Normally, when I used to produce together with Jörg, he was much more into his equipment and I am lucky to say that he was the one who builds all the situations and combines the stacks and he was able to link a MIDI situation and all this stuff. I was always the one who came in when it was done, in a way. In the early days. Later, when we started working more with our first computers with all these early programs, like Creator, we learnt in parallel and then I got much more educated in these things. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of education, is this probably a time to give the voices a rest and listen to some Profan, for example? Wolfgang Voigt For example, it depends what you want to hear. I have some examples from noise to nice. Hard to say... Torsten Schmidt Noise, nice, where do you want to go [asks the audience]? Wolfgang Voigt Noise, nice? Get awake, or want to sleep? Audience members Noise! Wolfgang Voigt Noise? You want to have a noise example? Loud noise. I’ll give you something really special. [looks through his records] OK, where we got this... You know, I’m the best DJ in the world, I don’t find any records. By the way, I’ve never been a DJ, you know? I was never able to combine with two record players music, because I’m only a producer? I never understood, how they could do this. I was always impressed. OK… Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless, you seem to favor vinyl heavily. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, vinyl? Torsten Schmidt Yeah. What did you call it, the “king medium”? Wolfgang Voigt Thank you. It’s good to get awake again, isn’t it? Torsten Schmidt Yeah, Michael Mayer beware, there might be some competition in your own house now. Wolfgang Voigt Of course, he might get jealous. Torsten Schmidt Um, questions, anyone? Audience member What is that record called? Wolfgang Voigt That record is called M:I:5. Originally, it’s from ’92, this is a repressing from ’95 on the label called Auftrieb. Torsten Schmidt How do you translate that, into English? Wolfgang Voigt Sorry? Torsten Schmidt However do you translate Auftrieb into English? Wolfgang Voigt Auftrieb, hmm. Torsten Schmidt Air that lifts you up? Wolfgang Voigt Yes, air that lifts you up, but it’s coming from somewhere else. Normally, auftrieb on the one hand means, of course it’s a German word, it means air that’s moving up, it’s the push from coming on, the air that’s coming on. And the second meaning is when, in Bavaria, the [farmers] bring up the cows in spring, for the summer season, into the mountains, you know? To eat the grass. What they do this is called auftrieb… Torsten Schmidt So, what’s M:I:5? Is it another section of the KGB or CIA or? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, yeah, it has two meanings. On the one side, it means Mike Ink #5, and then it’s, of course, MI5, the English secret service. I only can explain that in German, it’s called ”Maßstab eins zu fünf.” It’s a term out of, can you explain it? What means ”Maßstab eins zu fünf?” Torsten Schmidt It’s measures, right? If you use a map, it’s like something that’s magnified by a ratio of five to one. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, and it’s coming more out of the architecture language, and this record is not a good example. I’ll give you one last example for something, what I mean with M:I:5 is… Under the project name M:I:5, I used to use a certain theory in music while I used to push the rhythmic sample based on the loop, just ”boof boof boof,” you know? I let it run on the original key in the original speed. And then on top of it I push the same button five notes below, from C to G. Torsten Schmidt That’s a large fifth. Wolfgang Voigt Yes, exactly, exactly. This gives a certain kind of relation in rhythm to contradicting beats which run together and build a new beat. And this is the relation one to five, because it needs five notes down. Now, I can give you an example for this. Might be interesting. This is what was later popular under the name Abstract Techno on the label Profan. This is just drum beats, combined in the measure step of five notes below, which sounds very strange, of course. Wolfgang Voigt OK, this is how M:I:5 sounds when it’s only beats. Then it sounds very easy and you can understand it. The same idea, or the same method sounds like this when there’s also harmony involved. Torsten Schmidt Do we have some questions from the floor, please? Where is the mic? There is a mic. Wolfgang Voigt Yes? Audience member I’m not really a great fan of techno, but I’m a great fan of house music, on the whole. I was wondering if like, in terms... OK, let’s look at me. I feel like the music that I make, I feel very emotional, sometimes. I was wondering, is there any particular emotion that you would describe, you feel every time when you make that music? Wolfgang Voigt You mean, what kind of emotion... Audience member Yeah, what kind of emotions, yeah, yeah. Wolfgang Voigt I would say, I never could imagine, or I don’t remember that I ever did music without any emotion, or without any emotion getting involved. It depends on what kind of emotion. I absolutely understand if anybody doesn’t understand the emotional aspect of what I do, or what anybody else might do. It’s a very private thing. You know, like emotion is, it’s very subjective in a way. On the one side, I’ve got a very theoretical thing going on, also. This is very much about thinking, for most of the music I did. But it never happened without any emotional side or aspect. For me, this is all full of feelings and emotions and I used to say, I never did any music without giving my heart’s blood into it, you know? I’ve never made cold music. For me… I’ve never listened to cold music. But, of course, this is a question of taste, you know? Even in techno music, music which people might think is cold... I will give you an example, which might be interesting. Where a lot of people might say, “Where is the emotional side in this kind of music?” Because there are no harmonies involved and there is nothing. It is a very radical example for a minimal track, which I think is one of the most emotional tracks I ever did and I’m known for. I guess, you might not hear what I mean, because for me in a very fantastic and emotional way, it’s really nearly nothing – but in the best way you could imagine what nothing could be. Audience member Yeah, I must say, I really found it interesting that you feel very emotional in this art of nothing. I like the term that you put like the art, you know, the minimal art, you know? Because you can feel it’s a very solid product, and to someone else, it would feel very emotional, or doesn’t make sense. To some people, I find people wouldn’t understand my music as well. But you’d find me in a state of crying sometimes, but someone else would be like, “Hey you’re mad, you crazy.” So, you know, yeah. Wolfgang Voigt Of course, I think it’s really clear that it’s easier to explain to people that, say, a wonderful ballad of Smokey Robinson might be more emotional on the first view, first way of feeling, than this, of course. I would agree on this, because I love ballads of Smokey Robinson, for example. But for me this is also full of the emotion, because I’m not able to produce any music, any art without an emotion. You see all these great pictures hanging around here? Which is only to isolate the acoustics. For me, they’re totally warm and nice. Because I like this grey very much. It touches me. For me, it’s full of emotion. And it’s a question of taste, you know? Audience member Yeah, thanks very much. Wolfgang Voigt You’re welcome. Torsten Schmidt Looks like good German steel. Wolfgang Voigt Warm steel, yeah. Audience member Hi. Wolfgang Voigt Hi. Audience member I’m not either a fan of techno music. Actually, like this last week, I’ve been listening to more techno and house than in my whole life. Since you talked about Kraftwerk many times, and I’m a big fan of Kraftwerk, I’d like to know why this drum pattern in the electronic music, like dance music as a whole, has never changed? Kraftwerk had many different patterns, like that influenced Miami bass, and all that funky stuff. Wolfgang Voigt You mean by techno, why it’s always the same beat? Audience member Yeah, I mean, I get many differences of the synthesizers and a rhythm as a general, even in percussion and all that, but I would like to know, why you think that it never changed. The same bass drum, like straight up. Wolfgang Voigt Because this is a heart of techno, you know? The main thing of techno is the four- to-the-floor bass drum. If you leave that out, it’s not techno any more. This is, you know, this is the main idea. This is – how can I say? – this is the religion of techno, if you like. Audience member This was like at the beginning it was set up. OK, everybody, who is doing techno has got to have this straight up drum pattern. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah. There is one non-verbal worldwide main language, which combines people in techno. This is the bass drum. Anything else on top of the bass drum, even thousands of beat variations are allowed on techno, but you can never change the bass drum. It’s an untouchable rule in a way. This is very important for this music, otherwise it’s not techno any more. In other ways of music, even in hip-hop, you know, they got so many interesting amazing great beats and they’ve got many opportunities of doing variations – being faster, being slower. Being laid-back and steady and very abstract, and it’s still hip-hop, because you will recognize hip-hop on different sides. But in techno it’s still the bass drum, you know? There is a certain idea, when you run around on the side of clubs, or you’ve been in the parking lot in front of the techno place, but you always hear the bass drum. When your neighbor listens to techno, it’s the bass drum. The rest is free, you know? Audience member OK, thank you. Audience member Hi, I was wondering about Kompakt. Two things really. Just generally, I’m curious about where you are taking Kompakt next in the future, the next couple of years? Also I am wondering about all the sub-labels, it seems that they’ve been kind of shifting shapes lately. Like, a sub-label for Kompakt that would be known for putting out really hard techno and then would release an ambient tune, all of a sudden. And a sub-label that was known to release new artists would release really old classic Kompakt artists. Was that like a conscious thing to confuse record buyers and listeners? I’m curious about that and the future of Kompakt, if there is any plan. Wolfgang Voigt Maybe the second question. Of course, we’re well-known for surprising people. You know, we invented these sublabels, first of all, for a certain kind of sound idea. Even for hard techno, or for ambient stuff. At a certain point, we feel like surprising ourselves and even our audience, yeah, with surprises in breaking these rules. As I explained in the different example earlier, when rules get too established, we all get bored by rules. First our own, as artists, the one who did the label, then our audience. And then sometimes we have to wake them, you know, and surprise them with an ambient release on the hardcore techno label. On the other side, we have to face the market reality, because the musical market, especially for physical records, as most of you might know, has changed radically in the last years. In the earlier years it was much easier to sell records because records were the main way to transport this music. Now, we got all these files and all this MP3 culture, which makes it harder to sell physical records. So you have to be very careful and have to make decisions, unfortunately for marketing reasons, which you might not have done years earlier, you know? And to come to the first part of the question – the future of the label in general is, first of all, to go on like we are, to stay interesting, to surprise ourselves and our audience and the people. But, of course, we also have to face the reality and also the problems in the market. Also, the market has changed our release policy, of course. But I think as long as this music is existing like this we will go on like this. Audience member I’d just like to add that also one of the biggest techno tracks of this year by Patrice Bäumel, “Roar”, I don’t know if you heard it – it’s on Get Physical – it has no kick drum. Wolfgang Voigt Oh. But it got still a four-to-the-floor-feeling measure. Audience member Kind of yeah. And I think he was a [Red Bull Music Academy] participant as well. Wolfgang Voigt It’s interesting to come back to this question. From time to time, let’s say, every ten thousand techno release, it’s even possible to leave out the bass drum between another two tracks with bass drum. If you go on thinking of this idea of techno, it’s very radical. Of course, it’s possible to leave out the bass drum like in breaks, you know? In techno the bass drum only goes out to come back, you know? When you stand on the floor, it’s wonderful, when it goes out just to come back. Very rarely and in very good tracks it’s possible to leave it out – to use this special release between other tracks, but you keep the feeling, the DJ can keep the feeling. It keeps existing, even if people don’t hear it. But the feeling is still techno. Audience member There are some of very interesting rhythms in this track that sort of just take it away from the bass drum, and I think it’s cool, but thanks. Wolfgang Voigt You’re welcome. Audience member I would like to know if you’re in love with some kind of special analog equipment from the ’60s, made in Germany [laughs]. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, there is still this nostalgic thing we all have with all these old instruments, like the Moogs. It’s not even from Germany, but also the well-known German machines. For me, I never had such an emotional relationship with these kind of machines like some friends I know, who have them in glass furniture and clean them up every day and kiss them every morning, you know? I never had that emotional feeling to machines. I was always in love with the sound they make. And when I listen to records, which I really love and they influence me, and I found out, “OK, it’s this machine, I’ve got to have it,” you know? But I’m not the one who is praying every day, “Thank God for these machines.” I like them, but honestly, I can also live without them. Audience member Thank you. Audience member Hey, I wanted to ask whether there is a sexuality in Kompakt? Whether it’s camp, or whether it wants to be kind of ambiguous and whether that comes from, say, the history of Cologne clubs, or whether that now comes out as a kind of personality, that was played out in the new Pet Shop Boys release that you guys have? Wolfgang Voigt You mean the sexual side of Kompakt? Where we stand? Audience member No, just whether that is a part of the stylistic part of the aesthetic? Wolfgang Voigt Of course, for us it’s very important to be very open-minded. We always used to look for very good roads in every direction, you know? This is just one reason why I think we represent the whole palette, if you like, of every option, in every direction, of course. We’ve got no certain direction and we’re not afraid of any tendencies. Audience member Yeah, because I think there is an interesting kind of thing, if you got certain kind of a very camp feel in some kind of Italo disco, and then that kind of world you can have this kind of Detroit techno being quite masculine and male. But if I think of all of you guys, you, Michael and Axel and things, there is a bit more fluidity, you know? There is conscious desire to be ambiguous. Wolfgang Voigt Aha, yeah. I cannot really explain where it’s coming from. It’s just our feeling, our lifestyle in a way, which you feel in a way we do our music, you know? It’s – for certain times we are looking for these kind of musical languages, styles and sometimes more on the other side. I can’t really explain it. It’s coming by nature, you know? There is no certain, how can I say, no certain idea or... Audience member Is it maybe more real on the dancefloor? Wolfgang Voigt Yeah, it’s really. It’s just happening. Audience member Thank you. Torsten Schmidt Any more participant questions in the place? And yes, for the record, Cologne is a gay capital if that’s what you asked. We’re happy with that, all of us. Audience member So in the Kompakt building, in the basement, you have a room with a cool PA system and it’s completely sound-isolated. So, it sounds like a great place for after-parties there. Wolfgang Voigt You mean in our shop? Audience member Yeah. Wolfgang Voigt Yeah? Audience member So do you have after-parties there? Wolfgang Voigt OK, sorry. We used to have this earlier. To be honest, this tradition is gone a bit. But in earlier times and earlier years, we used also to have spontaneous after-parties, or parties directly in the shop, you know? In front of all the best records you could get, it’s easy to do. Yeah, drink some beers with the customers, and then you close the shop and the party starts. Today it happens really rarely. We’re equipped to do this in the shop and, of course, we’re allowed to do this. But honestly, after all these years it’s getting more rare. In the earlier years we had this like every day. No… twice a week. Audience member Cool. Torsten Schmidt Which brings us probably to round this off into a new paradigm, because obviously you talked a lot about earlier, about this youthful energy and stuff. I mean, obviously without hinting at anything, but you’re definitely not 17 any more, and a 17-year-old definitely has a totally different life style. Nevertheless, a lot of your music is consumed by people at their peak of energy levels and stuff. How do you prevent – despite being techno with body and soul – becoming a Rolling Stones character within a techno scenario? Wolfgang Voigt Maybe I’m one of the first that we find out that it’s possible to become a Rolling Stones character in techno, or I might get to Cologne, the Mick Jagger of techno. I don’t know. I don’t think that age, really, and I say it really from the bottom of my heart, it’s not important in this music. It’s no question of age, you know? For me it’s a question, of course, of credibility and the question of lifestyle. Of course, I’m not 17 any more and, of course, I’m not so much interested in having a party like 17-year-old guys, because the energy is totally different. But, on the other side, there is really a constant connection in techno, between all these generations. I mean, we have three, four or five – depends on how you see it – generations in techno and there is still a strong connection. I live in techno. I do nothing else. I’m involved in techno every day more or less in different kinds of ways. So it’s just a question of, yeah, credibility. If people don’t want that any more, or don’t want you any more, or don’t feel you’re credible any more, you will find out very fast, in a way. It’s a combination. On the one side, you’re getting adult, in a way, and older with techno, and you find new positions, even in supporting younger artists and pushing them. But, on the other side, there is still this wonderful experience, where we are all the same on the dancefloor, you know? Torsten Schmidt Well, I’d say raver fists in the air and thank you Wolfgang Voigt. Wolfgang Voigt Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]
(music: M:I:5 – Unknown Track / applause)
(music: M:I:5 – unknown)
(music: M:I:5 – unknown)
Of course, it’s very abstract and you can imagine, not so many DJs will play this music. [applause] Thank you very much.
(music: Wolfgang Voigt - unknown)
You think it’s emotional? OK, what do we have? It’s absolutely minimal, you know? I can stop it here, because I can explain it. It’s nearly like an endless loop, you know? I could really have cut it like a loop. But what’s happening is a very rare thing. Just a little bit of emphasizing of really nothing. The ingredients are definitely cold. It’s coming from a Yamaha machine. It’s even not sampling, you know? So, there might be a lot of reasons why we can say this has no certain warm quality. No heart, no emotion. But, for me, it’s full of emotion, you know? I’m standing in this loop feeling surrounded by tons of emotions. But, of course, you have to feel it and it’s a question of taste. I understand if everybody would say, “I feel nothing with this.” I understand. I even take it like a compliment, in a way.

Sub Pop
If there’s a Seattle sound, then it’s the sound that was powered by Sub Pop. Known to the world as grunge, it turned the sleepy northwestern city into the epicenter of guitar music for years, and gave the rock world one of its most enduring icons in Kurt Cobain. In conversation at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy, Sub Pop’s Carly Starr, Mark Arm and Megan Jasper tell us about the label’s growth and the city’s transition, of the storm that was whipping up around them and how they survived once the public eye turned elsewhere. It’s an incredible story of how indie labels grow and adapt in an ever-changing musical world.
Audio Only Version Transcript: NICK DWYER Right now it gives me great pleasure to welcome Carly, Mark and Megan. I’m sure anyone who had television in the late ’80s, early ’90s knows about Sub Pop in general, one label that has immortalized Seattle on the music map. [applause] Are you all well? MEGAN JASPER We’re psyched to be here and we want to thank you guys very much for having us here. NICK DWYER A lot of people in this room have been to Seattle or lived there, but a lot of people in this room might never have been there and have no idea about it. Carly, you weren’t born in Seattle, Mark you’ve lived here for quite a while. What do you like most about Seattle? MEGAN JASPER The thing I love most about it is it offers everything you’d want from a city, but it’s small and manageable. We were joking with Nick earlier about how so many of the people who are working here in the city with the Red Bull Music Academy are people we all know, and that’s because there’s so much overlap in the music community here, and that makes what we do far more meaningful and fun. The other thing I love about being here is that you’re right next to nature. You can split and within 30 minutes you can be snowboarding or hiking and just doing so many incredible things that I would not be able to do in other cities, and I appreciate that. NICK DWYER Megan, what’s your role in the Sub Pop empire? MEGAN JASPER [laughs] I work as a general manager there but half the time I just feel like a mascot. MARK ARM Don’t we all? MEGAN JASPER The company is a funny place in that it started out, like so many other small businesses, as a very small organization. It became large fairly quickly at one point, then we ended up downsizing. For the past five or six years, we’ve really not grown, we’ve ended up being a medium-sized company of about 25 people. I worked to hire some of those people when we need someone new to come in and just deal with basic operations. NICK DWYER Mark, tell us about yourself? MARK ARM I play in a band and put records out on Sub Pop. Now I work at Sub Pop and play in a band and put records out on Sub Pop. NICK DWYER And the band that you play in? MARK ARM Mudhoney. NICK DWYER Just to give people an idea of the foundations that Sub Pop was laid on, what was the music scene like in Seattle in the late ’70s and early ’80s? What inspired Sub Pop? MEGAN JASPER I think Mark might answer this better than me because when I moved to Seattle, it was in ’89 and I’d never been to Seattle until the late ’80s. So I know what my impression was like, but I think you might be better speaking on that because you were playing music then. MARK ARM There were a lot of cover bands playing in bars around town and a handful of people who weren’t into that, and they would rent out halls that would get closed down because people would steal meat from the freezers or fuck up the toilets. Every once in a while someone would open up a club, that might last a year or so. Then the Teen Dance Ordinance came in which shut down all-ages shows. Luckily, the people I was hanging out with had mostly just turned 21 at that time and there were one or two places that would let our bands play on Tuesday or Wednesday nights, you know, the hot nights of the week. [laughter] And that’s kind of what it was like in the mid-’80s. NICK DWYER Are you talking about the teen dance laws? Tell us a bit more about this movement. MARK ARM There used to be a disco-y place called the Monastery that some of the kids came to, and the older people would feed them MDMA. Some of the kids’ parents were freaked out by this and I guess they had ties to people in the city government. They came down hard and passed these insane laws, that if you wanted to have an all-ages show, you had to have like a million dollars worth of insurance. Making it basically impossible to have an all-ages show, and that drove things further underground, which in a way was really good. NICK DWYER What bands were having a major influence for the scene? MARK ARM I can’t talk about everyone else, but I was listening to the classic rock sort of stuff that was on the radio, but somewhere along the line I discovered punk rock, and that changed my life. So I was going to see a lot of bands like Black Flag when they came around on tour. But then the hardcore, play-as-fast-as-you-can thing got really boring and I rediscovered music I hadn’t really listened to before, like Black Sabbath and the Stooges, who I knew already. If you were a punk kid, one of the first band you knew about from an earlier era was the Sonics. After a while you just get tired of hearing Minor Threat clones, as good as Minor Threat was. MEGAN JASPER Do you mind if I jump in? MARK ARM Please do. [laughs] MEGAN JASPER The thing that was really amazing to me coming from the East Coast and moving to Seattle was it really felt like two different worlds at the time. On the East Coast, specifically in Massachusetts where I lived, we were coming out of a very good economic time and into a very bad one. It was not uncommon to have construction just lying unfinished in the road. There were people who had lived in Massachusetts for generations who were leaving because there were no opportunities. When I moved to Seattle in 1989 it was totally different because it still felt very isolated, which I’m sure it must have been even earlier than that. Larger bands would skip over Seattle, they’d play in San Francisco, they’d play in LA… MARK ARM They’d play Minneapolis, maybe they’d get to Denver. MEGAN JASPER So I felt very lucky as a kid because there was a time when I could see those bands. Thank god, when I came here I was 22 so I could see more shows than what underage kids could access and enjoy. It was strange because you had this small city that was in the process of being built up. There was so much construction in Seattle at the time, everyone was working so there were tons of opportunities. At the same time there was a really funny – to me – dark side, which was where a lot of the music was happening. Seattle seemed like a different place by day than by night. People were going out, there was a sense that there was a very lively and thriving scene for musicians and people who loved music. NICK DWYER You mention the geographical and musical isolation. Did this have an effect on the sound that was beginning to emerge that was kind of localized? MEGAN JASPER It’s funny because I think a lot of people have a tendency to say bands in certain cities sound a certain way. There’s some truth in that, because a lot of people who play in bands play with each other, or sonically they inspire each other, there’s some type of overlap that exists. At the same time, as someone who loved a lot of the bands from Seattle, I never thought Mudhoney sounded like Tad or Tad sounded like Soundgarden. So when people decided they were going to have this lazy shortcut and call it all grunge, most of us thought that was laughable. MARK ARM And yet you perpetuated it. [laughter] MEGAN JASPER That was the fun part. NICK DWYER Where did the term grunge come about? MEGAN JASPER That was from Bruce Pavitt. Someone called up to interview him. Bruce had this long cord on his phone… NICK DWYER Who is this mystery man? MEGAN JASPER Thank you for asking, sorry, I didn’t do the background. Sub Pop was founded by two people, Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman. Jonathan was here earlier and had to split because he was going to New York today. Bruce actually founded Sub Pop and Jonathan joined in, they were working together in the office from early in its history. Bruce is just wonderful and crazy and bright and creative and just out of his mind. Some people would sit in fear because it wasn’t uncommon for him to come up to people and be like, “So what exactly do you do around here?” There were like six or seven employees and everyone knew what everybody else did. But Bruce sometimes forgot. So one day he was on the phone doing an interview and he was asked, “What’s the name of this music you put out?” And he rolled his eyes because it’s the same question again and he said, “Grunge.” Great. And then it became this weird epidemic. NICK DWYER At this point should we watch a video, give people some idea of where we’re at at the very beginnings of Sub Pop? MEGAN JASPER I would love to break this up and share some stuff. The other thing I’d say is, if there are any questions, we would love to answer them. MARK ARM And sit up straight, come on. [laughter] MEGAN JASPER So maybe let’s start with one of the videos. Can we have the Dwarves’ “Drugstore” video. (music: The Dwarves – “Drugstore” / applause) NICK DWYER So tell us a bit about the band we just saw. MEGAN JASPER The Dwarves were not from the Seattle but they were the second band to sign to the label after the Afghan Whigs. MARK ARM The Fluid. MEGAN JASPER Oh, the Fluid, that’s right, so they were the second or third band signed. [laughs] The thing that was so great about them was they would write songs that were just seconds long, as you can see. Live they were one of the most exciting bands I ever saw. There was something very raw and scary and maybe even dangerous, almost in a GG Allin-type way. You never knew what you were going to get. MARK ARM I think after seeing them a couple of times you knew what you were going to get. MEGAN JASPER Yeah, maybe there were a few surprises. [laughs] But the thing I loved and really appreciated about them was, even though they came off as really flippant, irreverent and in a great way kind of retarded, they were also some of the most intelligent people I’ve ever worked with. [Singer] Blag is a complete brainiac and will just go off on whatever subject he’s interested in at length and intelligently. They were just really into conceptualizing stuff and really fun to work with. At one point they believed Sub Pop owed them quite a lot of money and they were just, “We’re gonna come up there and trash the fucking joint, you people better run.” [laughs] “We were all like, yeah, OK.” I think maybe one person left – Milo, the kid who worked downstairs – but everyone else stuck around. And when they came up they were total pussycats, like, [weedy voice] “What’s going on?” And they took a can of spray paint and this is how they trashed the joint. I mean, come on, just throw something, but they didn’t. They took a can of spray paint and wrote on the tiled section of the floor, which could be cleaned up, “You owe Dwarves money.” [laughter] That is not trashing, come on! But it made for fun times. I wouldn’t mind playing some music if you guys don’t mind. AUDIENCE MEMBER What year are we talking about? MARK ARM Probably about ’89. I’ve got another Dwarves story. We were playing with them in San Francisco and afterwards the singer of the band, Blag, invited us back to his apartment for a party. We figure this is going to be wild, drugs, girls, everything. We get over there and he keeps telling us to be quiet because the neighbors are complaining. [laughter] So that’s how rad the Dwarves were. NICK DWYER Before we go into another track, one of the common themes with guest lecturers is that whenever there’s been a revolution, radio has played a major part. What was the role of the radio in Seattle around this time? MEGAN JASPER I would say there was no part as far as radio. None. MARK ARM Even KCMU, which is now KEXP, was pretty much an anglophile station at the time, they played a lot of the Cure. In the early days they weren’t playing much local music at all. Jonathan had a local show where he’d play demos by local bands, but not until stuff got noticed outside of the country and in other countries did anyone here really give a shit. And then they really gave a shit, which was annoying. NICK DWYER Do you want to play something now? MEGAN JASPER I’d love to. I thought one of the songs off Sub Pop 200 and Tad’s “Sex God Missy” might be good, and maybe the Thrown-Ups. [laughter] Or not. You want to pick another one? MARK ARM Definitely start with that Tad song. Sub Pop originally started off as a fanzine that Bruce Pavitt did and a couple issues of them were cassette compilations. This is the second comp that originally came out on vinyl. The one before that wasn’t really local bands, it was more national, groups like Big Black, Skinny Puppy, which was weird, and the U-Men were the only local band, I think. NICK DWYER What was the major reason Jonathan and Bruce decided to join forces? Bruce, as you said already, had the fanzine and was putting out cassettes and he’d already put out the Green River album, I believe. At what point did they go, “Right, let’s start a label?” MARK ARM They were already working together when they did the Green River album. Bruce was really into Green River and Jonathan was really into Soundgarden and they decided to pool their resources, as far as I understand. MEGAN JASPER Jon was promoting shows in town and was spending a lot of his time doing that. Bruce was writing and they were two people in a very small group. MARK ARM And DJing. MEGAN JASPER And DJing, right. I forgot about that. They originally thought Sub Pop would just be a singles-only label and they would release 7"s but their ideas changed quickly and they ended up releasing full albums. NICK DWYER Did they originally want to focus on Seattle artists or did they feel there should be no boundaries? MEGAN JASPER I think they felt they were around all this great music and there was nobody to put it out. Bruce had already started in some ways with the compilations and they were doing the singles. Finally they realized there was a need for people to hear this music and people wanted to hear it, so they just kept going with it. So we’re going to hear a song by a group called Tad and in my opinion they were one of the most amazing bands in Seattle at that time. (music: Tad – “Sex God Missy” / applause) NICK DWYER Tell us a bit about Tad. MEGAN JASPER Did they start in like ’87? MARK ARM Probably not until about ’88, they started up after we did. MEGAN JASPER The thing I loved about Tad, for any of you who don’t know anything about this band, the lead singer Tad is, shall we say, corpulent, and extremely so. The first time I saw them play was in New York and he had the token “Sub Pop Loser” T-shirt on. Here was this guy who just looked like an obese lumberjack, facial hair. You hear all this shit about Bigfoot and Tad was the closest thing I’d ever seen to maybe really being a Bigfoot. MARK ARM I’ll pass that on to him. MEGAN JASPER Please do. And then he got up on stage and totally floored me because he played this incredible gritty but amazing music. I was a huge fan. Nick Dwyer One thing you mentioned before, you said that when Bruce and Johnathan first started the label they were really just thinking of putting out 7"s. There was this thing, the Sub Pop Singles Club, tell us a little bit about that. Megan Jasper The Sub Pop Singles Club was... Those guys loved doing 7"s and there were a lot of people around that time who believed that, really every release should just be a 7", because the idea was that most albums really consisted of two great songs and so much filler in between. That’s not why the Singles Club existed, it existed for a couple of reasons and actually one of the reasons was quite practical, is that the label needed money. They needed money really badly, so they figured if they set up this subscription service with bands that they were really excited about, they would have a constant incoming stream of cash. The other thing on top of it is when you work at a label, you can't work with every single band that you really, really love, and so one way to reach out to so many of these other bands is to just do a single with them. It sort of worked with their philosophy as well as just a more practical... Nick Dwyer How many people around that time were actually on the subscription? Megan Jasper There were... I should know this... Nick Dwyer Was it overseas as well, or was it just America? Megan Jasper It was overseas as well. I believe I remember it at one point being like... Oh my god, I think maybe there were like seven or eight thousand at one point. Then it sort of whittled down by the very end, it was maybe around 1,500. nick Dwyer Some of those records are, obviously, worth a lot of money now. Megan Jasper Yeah. The weird thing is that there were some singles that Sub Pop did, non-Singles Club singles but regular ones. There was always some bit of limited-edition something, so weird-colored vinyl, or black vinyl that was more rare than the colored stuff, they'd try to switch it up and play around with it. There were some 7"s, back in the day, that they couldn't even give away. They sat and collected dust and... Nick Dwyer We're not going to name names or we are? Megan Jasper I'm going to name them. One was the Smashing Pumpkins, we couldn't give them away if we tried. We'd use them as coasters, we'd throw them as Frisbees. The other one was a Hole 7". Couldn't give it away. It was unbelievable. Eventually the bands became so huge and they sold out, there were some people that were very happy to get the last couple copies. But I'll tell you, if I never see those covers again, I'll be psyched because I had to look at them for way too long. NICK DWYER A lot of people have this warped sense of reality about Sub Pop, that you were extremely successful and it all went boom right away. But the first four years were tough, weren’t they? MEGAN JASPER They were extremely tough, and as much fun as they were, it was very stressful. Sub Pop had this hype around it, and that's why people thought it was a very successful place. And there was money coming in through direct sales and through the Singles Club. But the reality was Bruce and Jonathan were huge music fans but not real businessmen, and they learned as they went along how to run a business, but they didn’t realize there might be smart ways to make ends meet, such as, create a budget and work within that budget. They spent money as they needed to spend money and there were many, many times when things were very stressful at work because we didn’t have money and we needed to get the new Tad record out or we needed to make sure a band could get to Europe and their flights were paid for. I’m making it out to sound horrible and there were days that were, but most of the time it was really fun because you were around these incredible, creative people or there were these incredible musicians who’d come in all the time because they needed something or they were downtown and wanted to hang out. There were good times, but it seemed to get steadily worse before it got any better. The reality was many people got laid off. It went from a 25-person operation down to a four- or five-person operation almost overnight. Seattle is, especially at that point, a very small city and so you’re talking about friendships. They were difficult times for both Bruce and Jonathan and it affected them in ways that I believe neither fully recovered from. NICK DWYER You were there at that time? MEGAN JASPER I was, and I was laid off at that time. NICK DWYER One common theme through the last 20, 30 years of music history is that it often takes someone from another country, generally a magazine, to start getting excited about it and then the hype starts building from there. This is what happened with Sub Pop, there was a journalist from the Melody Maker. So tell us about that. This was just the start of what was to become this huge media explosion. MEGAN JASPER Yeah, there was this kid called Everett True. MARK ARM Kid? MEGAN JASPER Not really a kid. He always had this old vibe about him, huh. I call everyone a kid. So there was this freakozoid from Melody Maker called Everett True. Everett was really intrigued with the stuff Sub Pop was doing. MARK ARM He was also a huge fan of K Records. MEGAN JASPER That’s right, he loved Calvin Johnson. He started a record company called K out of Olympia, Washington. He was a in a band called Beat Happening and released many of his own records. We’re leaving some of these CDs with you if you’re at all curious, there’s a Beat Happening song on the Sub Pop 200 compilation. But Everett came over and interviewed people at that time and did this article on Seattle and Sub Pop and that led to one thing, led to another, led to another. MARK ARM John Peel was playing some of the singles before Everett came out too. MEGAN JASPER So he probably tapped into that. Basically, people overseas were getting into it before many people here got into and realized something pretty cool was happening. NICK DWYER Obviously, what followed was a musical media circus of a kind that hasn’t been seen since. For you, being firmly entrenched, at what time did you think this was all getting a bit pear-shaped? MEGAN JASPER Really early, actually. MARK ARM Probably around ’89, ’90. MEGAN JASPER By 1990 it became intolerable. MARK ARM And then it got worse. MEGAN JASPER That’s exactly what was happening, you’d talk to people and say, “Does this seem crazy?” And people would go, “Yeah, it’s pretty gross.” You’d say, “But it’s probably peaking right now.” Then you couldn’t imagine how it could get worse, yet it did. By getting worse, what was happening was there were A&R men coming in and signing every single band from Seattle. NICK DWYER Just because they were from Seattle? MEGAN JASPER Yeah, and sometimes great bands and sometimes bands who just made you think, “What the fuck is that person even thinking?” MARK ARM Candlebox. [laughter] MEGAN JASPER Yeah, exactly. So that was going on and just when you thought that it had peaked something even weirder happened. One day I was walking to the club Re-bar and this car stopped and pulled up beside me. They had weirdo Marysville hairdos. You probably don’t know what that means, but it’s a suburb hairdo. On the East Coast you make jokes about whatever the local suburb is, that equivalent. And they pulled up and said, “Hey, do you know if Mudhoney or Pearl Jam are playing anywhere tonight?” I was like, “Are you kidding me? No, I don’t think so.” And then they go, “Do you know where…?” And they had this list of venues in Seattle that they thought they might be able to and find some musicians. It was clear there had been this list someone had developed where they’d said, “If you want the grunge experience, do your bangs like this and go to this places. Drink a microbrew, you’re gonna be psyched.” This was fucking gross, for a number of reasons. The obvious, you had to deal with that. But also it took what was at the time a very rich community and forced it to disperse. A lot of the musicians were approached or it projected a lot of shit on them, people thought a certain thing about them. A lot of people just wanted to stay home. NICK DWYER What was the response of the community to all these A&R people sniffing around? MARK ARM Mostly amusement. For some people it was, “Hey, this is my chance.” We [Mudhoney] signed to a major label. We met a lot of very amusing A&R people and we met with one really cool one. NICK DWYER I hate to bring this up, but you’ll be immortalized forever in Google searches as the mastermind behind the whole grunge hoax, the grunge-speak thing. You’ve probably told this story a million times, but it’s the epitome of the extreme of how bad things got. MEGAN JASPER I actually haven’t told it in a while. This was in ’92 and Jonathan called me and said you won’t believe this, there’s a reporter from the New York Times… MARK ARM Judith Miller. MEGAN JASPER No, no. MARK ARM Just roll with it. [laughter] MEGAN JASPER OK, Judith Miller, you may have heard of her. No, I can’t remember the real kid’s name right now but he was curious in getting a lexicon of grunge. He believed in every culture there’s a way people speak and code words for things, and he wanted to tap into the grunge world and learn how to communicate properly with Seattle musicians. So Jonathan said he couldn’t answer his questions at all and thought I might have fun with it. So literally a minute later the phone rings and this kid is asking me if I’ll share the lexicon of grunge with him. I said, “You’ve got to be kidding me.” He said, “No, no, we’re doing a grunge piece and we’re including a lot of fashion.” So I said, “Give me the word and I’ll give you the grunge equivalent.” So he’s shooting out, “Girlfriend.” I think I said, “Tuna melt,” just giving him these horrible and obvious lies. I kept thinking at any minute he’s going to go, “OK, joke’s over.” But he didn’t. He didn’t print them all, he left out the ones that were a little too spicy. NICK DWYER Just to give you an example of how blatantly obvious they were, there was “swinging on flippety flop,” “bound and haggard” and “lamestain.” MEGAN JASPER Yeah, that was just when someone’s being a loser, you call them a lamestain. He asked, “What do you say when you call your buddy up to go out tonight?” “We call it swinging on the flippety flop.” And all I can hear is this [types on keyboard], he’s typing everything verbatim. And they printed it. And when they printed it, I was psyched! I just thought, “I’m done, nothing this good is ever going to happen to me again. I’m done.” I couldn’t believe no one questioned it. Two or three months later this publication called The Baffler, done by this kid called Tom Frank, who now does The Nation and lot of NPR stuff, he called up and said, “I know this is bullshit, I kind of want to pretend I’m breaking this big story.” Shortly after the editor of the New York Times phoned me up screaming because I’d lied about the grunge lexicon. I said, “Do you not have fact checkers? Because if you look at that it’s obviously not true.” Then they told me they knew it was a joke. So I said, “Then why are you yelling at me?” They couldn’t answer that one so we agreed to disagree. NICK DWYER Should we play something else, maybe another video? MEGAN JASPER Yeah, it was a time when you put the city under the spotlight. I keep saying it’s a drag and a bummer and everything, because as a music lover I could see a lot of stuff that I loved going away and that was upsetting to me. But there were many good things that came from it in the long run. It also forced Seattle to in time really reinvent itself and not just have second-rate Mudhoneys come up. Instead, you had Mudhoney and all these wonderful bands that came afterwards, like Built to Spill come from that, and Modest Mouse. So many bands that didn’t follow in the footsteps so much. For all the things I was saying were a bogus-ity, there was a pressure for them to do their own thing and find a way to do it really well. It felt gross at the time but things didn’t get old the way they could have. [discussion of which tracks to play] You want the Nirvana one? Why don’t we have those back to back. (music: Nirvana – “In Bloom” / applause) NICK DWYER Before we go to the next video, tell us a bit about Nirvana. Any media hype needs an icon, a focus. I read an interview with Jonathan who refers to Nirvana and Kurt [Cobain] in particular as the perfect storm. MEGAN JASPER You might want to jump into this one. MARK ARM Or not. [laughs] MEGAN JASPER This is where it gets difficult. [pause] Let me start by sharing a conversation. So much time passes and I still don’t know where to begin addressing this, so forgive me if I sound like a dunderhead. But when something becomes incredibly hyped – and it wasn’t just hype, there was true substance, that music touched people in a way that was transcendent – but when one person becomes the embodiment of a generation or a movement or a belief system, everything that any one person wants or desires or wishes are projected onto that one person. For years and years that’s almost what Nirvana were to me as it was with everyone else because that’s what you’re inundated with every day. That’s what you see on television and in magazines or whatever. Working with Nirvana was the same as any other band. These were great guys, funny guys, irresponsible guys, sometimes quiet, sometimes not quiet. They were like anybody else in that sense. Not to be irreverent about Kurt or Nirvana, but they were no more special than any of the other people or bands. It’s just that timing had a way of figuring out how to catapult them into this place that was almost unfathomable for anybody. MARK ARM But it wasn’t just him, you know, it was also Eddie Vedder at the time. It was pretty much the two of them and if it had been the other way around, if Eddie Vedder had killed himself instead of Kurt, it would’ve been his face on T-shirts around the world. [pause] It didn’t happen for that guy in Material Issue though. [laughs] MEGAN JASPER But working with them was really fun and they were a great band and undeniably Kurt was an incredible songwriter. When Jonathan talks about that perfect storm reference, he meant every element was in place for it to happen. The timing was right, the music being played on commercial radio was in desperate need of some actual fresh blood, something new and exciting. MARK ARM It always seems to be like that though. I mean, a year later commercial radio was like, what, Bush? MEGAN JASPER And now you can turn on commercial radio and sometimes you can hear the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Death Cab for Cutie, or Modest Mouse, just because the timing is right and there’s a need for something new. That’s what was happening at that time for bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana. AUDIENCE MEMBER I’m 27 now so this is my generation. I still remember the moment that Soundgarden and Nirvana were hitting our hearts, in one way we saw it happening. In the beginning there was this new music for us and it was very fresh, then there was this hype, then there was this icon. I saw it growing. Can you tell us something about it, because you were closer? Did you have the same idea? What happened? MEGAN JASPER It’s interesting for me listening to you because for any of us in Seattle, we were so close to everything that was happening that it was hard to see in a linear way. It partly felt surreal and then it partly felt like you were trying to measure what was happening so you could understand it and attempt to function within it. So when you say you’re aware of those stages and its growth, that’s amazing to me, because I was unable to do that. For people like me there were tons of us who just had jobs and were trying to do things day to day. It’s difficult because you’re trying to guess what’s going to happen next and you don’t quite know. I always feel like a dunderhead when I talk about it even though I’m supposed to be able to shed some insight, it’s difficult because you’re really just doing what you love to do and find a way to participate, in your job and the city you live in and not to get swallowed up in it and think it’s something that is going to last. This was something that came quickly and was going to go quickly, so you just kinda waited for the burn-out to happen. That’s what it was like for me, rather than seeing true growth. AUDIENCE MEMBER You said it was gross to see everything exploding, but I grew up in Israel and only after Nirvana exploded did we get into the sound and start exploring Sub Pop and the singles and Mudhoney and the Melvins and L7, the Tads. That was all because we got exposed to the Nirvana explosion. MEGAN JASPER I think I keep sounding like I’m super negative, and I have to apologize for that. But maybe a better way for me to describe it is, you know when you find a band that not many people know about but you really love? You can’t stop listening and you hang on every lyric. I felt like that with the music that I was around. I really felt that I was around a number of exciting and brilliant musicians and creative minds, like Jonathan and Bruce and my friend Erica, Charles Peterson, who was a photographer. I felt like I had totally lucked out and fallen into this situation that blew me away. But suddenly the band you love starts to become more popular and there are people you think you could never have related to are wearing the T-shirts and singing the songs. When you get older you realize that’s a good thing, the more people are listening to wonderful music is a reflection of a better world. That’s an optimistic way of looking at it. But for me at the time I felt this community that was so rich and thriving, I could see elements coming in that I did not think were positive elements, and pulling it apart and diluting it. At the time I felt somewhat resentful. That’s me, just as a goofy kid with a job. If you were making music and were closer to it in an artistic sense, there must have been more of that push and pull. NICK DWYER What did Sub Pop do as a label? Did they try distancing themselves from that? By then a lot of those groups had signed with major labels, so did they try to go in the opposite direction? MEGAN JASPER They actually decided to head three hours south to Portland and sign a ton of those bands. So they remained in Seattle but they were like, “Oh my God, there’s this thing called I-5 South and if you stay on it for three hours you can see these bands the majors don’t know about.” So within what seemed like 40 seconds, they signed Pond, Sprinkler, Hazel, another band that I forgot the name of, the Spinanes. It’s almost like they took complete ownership of Portland. Seattle’s this big [makes small ‘O’ shape], Portland’s this big [makes tinier ‘O’ shape], so once they signed up all those bands they went, “Hmm, the East Coast doesn’t look so bad.” So they signed Six Finger Satellite, Green Magnet School and a number of other East Coast bands. What they realized was that they needed to branch out and that’s what was happening. NICK DWYER A lot of people don’t realize that Nirvana and Soundgarden were signed to Sub Pop, then Mr. Geffen comes along and does his thing. But Sub Pop still did alright out of that. Is that what definitely happened? When they got signed there was still something in it for the label? MEGAN JASPER Absolutely. For a long time Sub Pop saw itself as a launching pad, so you come to the small label that does artist development, release one, two or three records and then you should have your choice of whatever label you choose to work with. To some degree, that was true and Sub Pop could benefit in that if Geffen or Warner Bros. or whoever took this band and did right by them and expand what they already have, then Sub Pop benefits because Sub Pop has catalog and you can see their sales increasing. So there was money coming in, and who doesn’t want some extra operating money? It worked out well for everybody. MARK ARM And if the band sticks around for long enough, eventually they come back. [laughter] MEGAN JASPER It actually makes us really, really proud that we’re releasing Mudhoney records, not just because it’s nice to have a band come home, which is how it felt to us and hopefully for you guys, too. [laughs] But it makes for a great story and it means something. As much as people think of Sub Pop and think of Nirvana – or now young kids don’t, they think of the Shins or the Postal Service or Iron and Wine – but at that time it was Mudhoney. When we did tours, we described Sub Pop as the house that Mudhoney built. Before Nevermind came out and Sub Pop was in such a severe financial crisis, it was the release of Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge that Sub Pop belived would pull it out of the slump and get it back on its feet. So it’s great to have a band like that come back and release records. AUDIENCE MEMBER Do you still release vinyl or have you moved onto mp3? MARK ARM We’re talking about releasing records on vinyl and getting a code, which lets you download stuff for free, so you can own the vinyl and still have it on your iPod or whatever it is you have. NICK DWYER Do you still want to go to the video? MEGAN JASPER Do you guys want to see the Beat Happening video? (music: Beat Happening – “Hot Chocolate Boy” / applause) AUDIENCE MEMBER I heard a story about Jack Endino recording a lot of the early stuff for like 600 bucks or something like that. Did he record any of the Mudhoney stuff as well? MARK ARM Yeah. AUDIENCE MEMBER What’s he doing now? MARK ARM He just released a record. NICK DWYER Can you tell us a bit about Jack because he was the producer for that whole era? MARK ARM He was like the house producer. What do you want to know [laughs]? MEGAN JASPER He worked with everybody and what a lot of people don’t know is that he was a musician himself. Back in the ’80s he worked in a band called Skin Yard and they were on tour a lot, but he’s always been a musician as well as a producer. Is Phil Ek still here? MARK ARM Phil Ek, who’s that? MEGAN JASPER Phil is a producer who’s lived in Seattle all his life and was Jack Endino’s intern, his only intern and assistant. I just wanted to point that out. MARK ARM We should bring him up to tell some Jack Endino stories. MEGAN JASPER Do you have any? [inaudible response] Jack worked in this small recording space called Reciprocal. It still exists today, it’s owned by Chris Walla and Josh Rosenfeld. Chris is in Death Cab for Cutie and Josh has Barsuk Records. But it’s a tiny, tiny space and that’s where so many of those records from that time were recorded. MARK ARM I think Chris is trying to go for that real grunge-y sound. [laughter] AUDIENCE MEMBER [inaudible question] MARK ARM You know what I thought of it: I thought it was an overproduced pile of poop. I much prefer the sound of Bleach to the sound of Nevermind, but then I prefer the Stooges over Gwen Stefani. AUDIENCE MEMBER [inaudible question] MARK ARM That was Jack Endino and that was Chad Channing, not the original drummer, but the one who played with them for a few years. MEGAN JASPER Nevermind was ready to go as a Sub Pop record for a long time. We had to wait to put it out and by the time we were going to, they were already well into conversations with Geffen. And when they were signed to Geffen, they were first drumming with Dan from Mudhoney, then Dave Grohl came in after that. But they re-recorded the entire record for the major label release. AUDIENCE MEMBER Just for that major label, “you’ve got to do it again” kind of thing? MEGAN JASPER Partly that, partly because musicians always want to do things differently if they get the chance. But they wanted Dave on that record. AUDIENCE MEMBER Is the original around? MEGAN JASPER You could probably find it somewhere if you really looked. I don’t know where it is but I have a cassette of it somewhere at home. There were a lot of cassette copies that were passed around because it was a finished record at the people and people were hoping to get it ready for release. NICK DWYER When the grunge term disappeared from view I think a lot of people felt the Sub Pop label went with it into grunge obscurity. But the reality was Sub Pop was still growing. It wasn’t the best of years; the second wave was coming later. What was going on during these middle years? MEGAN JASPER One thing that happened is internationally it totally disappeared. When Sub Pop did a deal with Time Warner, they were supposed to be releasing a lot of the records internationally. They passed on many of them, so the only option was finding another label to license stuff. It was too much work, too messy, so there were many, releases that came about during the mid-’90s that never saw the light of day overseas. In some cases that’s probably a good thing. NICK DWYER Any names? MARK ARM Oh, there’s a list. MEGAN JASPER That’s the thing, where to begin [laughs]? But there were some great records that came out then – I thought Sebadoh made great records – but for every Sebadoh record there were a million [from other bands] that were just like, “Oh my god, what were people thinking?” NICK DWYER Were you working there at that time? MEGAN JASPER No, thank God. MARK ARM Just wanted to clear that up. MEGAN JASPER Yeah thanks for that. [laughter] NICK DWYER Something that did happen at this time, the man with the biggest beard I’ve ever seen, Bruce Pavitt, at what point did he leave and why did he leave? MEGAN JASPER A number of reasons. First off, once I was with him in Portland, post-Nevermind, it had been out for five or six months, and he said, “Where do you go from here? What next?” You could tell there was this pressure that he was feeling from someone or something to do it again and find a band that would be the perfect band at the perfect time and I don’t think he was excited about that pressure. On top of that, there were changes at Sub Pop, it was growing and transforming into a small version of a major label, and that grossed him out. When he started doing Sub Pop he never wanted that corporate feel or the static, gross comfort that comes with it. He felt an ongoing disconnect. Nick Dwyer How was it to Johnathan kind of taking the reigns by himself at this period? Megan Jasper It was really difficult because at the same time Johnathan's dad was dying of Alzheimer's, so Johnathan was at a point where he was slowly starting to check out just so he could emotionally cope with his family stuff as well. He's left with this obese organization that needs to streamline quite a bit and go on a big employee diet. I think he was feeling ill-equipped to deal with that because emotionally he just wasn't there, and he was by himself. Nick Dwyer A former fired employee came back, I do believe. Megan Jasper Oh yeah. I'd like to take full credit for all of the success. Nick Dwyer What stage did you come back in and what was your role when you came back into the company? Megan Jasper I came back in in 1998 and I came in as the head of the marketing departments. I believe that Johnathan brought me back, not because I was super qualified and there weren’t a million people who could have done a better job, because, to be honest with you, there are. But I think he trusted me and we were good friends and I understood the spirit of the company, I think he wanted to bring some of that back in but not make it an old Sub Pop, he wanted to sort of recreate it. I think I was lucky because I could be considered some new life and I was old life as well. I was very fortunate and lucky in that. Nick Dwyer If I may ask, what is Bruce doing now? And how long is the beard? Megan Jasper He trimmed the beard and he... Mark Arm It's gone. Megan Jasper Yeah, there was just stubble the last time he was around. It was kind of weird. So if anyone was hoping to have a little snack from 1989, not living in his beard anymore. We used to call him a pinata because you could smack his beard and crumbs from like two weeks ago would fly out. Anyway, probably don't want to know that. Right now he is... He switches between living in [inaudible] and living in Seattle. He's a dad, he has two kids. He'll always love music, but he listens to lots of different types of music and just follows his passion, whatever that is. AUDIENCE MEMBER I would like to go back a little. At the moment the hype was so big, when everyone was talking abut the marriage of Kurt Cobain rather than the music, I was getting interested in dance music, because I just wanted to hear something else, just a stupid reaction. Was there a similar thing in Seattle, that people were playing, like, techno? MEGAN JASPER I’m glad you brought that up. In the mid-’90s in Seattle, there was a huge and growing number of people into dance music. There were new record shops popping up every other day it seemed on Capital Hill. People will argue that it was Seattle that broke bands like the Prodigy. There was such support at the time. Sub Pop wasn’t really doing it at the time, they released records by Pigeonhed but never really delved into that genre. But there were communities in the city that totally embraced that. NICK DWYER As a backlash to the hype around the music they loved so much? MEGAN JASPER Probably just as a need for something new. It wasn’t grunge, it was exciting and new and young and it was thriving here. AUDIENCE MEMBER Is that where the sound of Postal Service, for instance, came from? MEGAN JASPER The Postal Service consists of Ben Gibbard from Death Cab For Cutie and Jimmy Tamborello, who does more electronic-type music in LA. I think that’s something that just happened through their collaboration. I know for a fact that they didn’t set out to do this fucking kick-ass dance record, their sensibilities just melded in a way that created that record. They’re both so smart in different ways, but it was something unintentional and truly natural that happened and made the record what it was. NICK DWYER Tell us about Sub Pop when you rejoined. What artists were you going for when you came back in 1998? Was there a particular kind of sound? MEGAN JASPER We were going for younger bands who required smaller budgets. Let’s work with younger bands that don’t have a whole lot of the baggage that Sub Pop created [laughs] and let’s not do contracts. Let’s not work with bands who want five-record deals. Let’s work with bands who want one-, two- or three-record deals so there’s a constant shift and rotation, new life in the label’s roster. So it was more of a philosophical thing that was happening. NICK DWYER Have you got any music from that era? MEGAN JASPER You know, I was going to bring some but then I just thought that was an ugly time. [laughter] NICK DWYER Why was it an ugly time? MEGAN JASPER Well, not an ugly time, I’m being [inaudible]. That time was truly about a shift in the label’s practice and philosophies. What that means in the real sense when you implement those philosophies and make some change is the phasing out of some bands and the bringing in of some new ones. I almost grabbed stuff, but as far as some bands go, it almost feels like a death, so I just tried to stay away from it. There are some great aspects to some of those bands and some great music that a lot of those bands made, so in a twisted attempt to be respectful I walked past that part of the catalog. NICK DWYER Was there a particular record after this ugly period when you felt you were onto something again that could bring back the vibrancy of the earlier period? MEGAN JASPER Yeah, it was short-lived but it was Looper, which was Stuart David from Belle and Sebastian and he did a record called Up a Tree and it was new, it was not like anything Sub Pop did at the time. They didn’t need a big budget and it felt exciting at the time. Shortly after that we worked with a band called the Beachwood Sparks and after that the Shins, none of these were bands that many people had heard of. So it was a gradual change to try finding younger, newer, smaller bands. MARK ARM Was Zen Guerrilla about that time? MEGAN JASPER I loved Zen Guerrilla, that was about that time. They’d released records, they were from San Francisco, and they had played maybe one of the best live sets compared to any other bands. I mean, mind-blowingly incredible live band. AUDIENCE MEMBER Afghan Whigs would be a good example of that process of changing, because they had that punk rock background, but they brought that Sonics sound, they had the soul and gospel thing, so it was an evolution. I mean, they did a Barry White cover. MEGAN JASPER The bands I was thinking of who had to be phased out were bands like Combustible Edison and even the Spinanes at the time, as much as I really loved stuff they were doing. We also started working with the Jesus and Mary Chain, which was exciting, but maybe not the smartest signing for Sub Pop, as big a fan as I am. NICK DWYER This is many years after [their most famous releases]. MEGAN JASPER Many years. But it was more those other bands, Friends of Dean Martinez… MARK ARM The Cocktail Revolution. MEGAN JASPER Yeah, a lot of that stuff needed to come to a screaming halt. NICK DWYER Shall we watch the video of Afghan Whigs? (music: Afghan Whigs – “Her Against Me” / applause) The bands we were talking about just before the video bring us to the present day. So where do Sub Pop see themselves now in the greater musical universe? Tell us about the Sub Pop of 2005. MEGAN JASPER It’s hard to know what’s to come because so much depends on a company’s mindset and from there you find things that work and fit those ideas. We love releasing music but what’s changing for us is the distribution of that music. We do far more digital sales than we did before. NICK DWYER Jonathan says you guys are into the internet and he talks about a digital meritocracy. How has internet sales affected your business? MEGAN JASPER People believed mp3s, and even just releasing them, was negatively affecting sales. But there’s no way around people sharing music, so if something is taking its natural course and you can’t control it, you have to work with it. So we tried to embrace that and make it part of our marketing, but what we’ve found is – I belive it has something to do with the fact we did it, but also because we’re working with great bands who are making great music – is our sales started to increase. When bands are fighting for radio time, just outlets so that people can hear what the band’s music sounds like, it’s easier to give them a listening station in whatever form works. We saw our sales increase digitally and physically. But our philosophy is, this is becoming the norm, it’s the way people are buying and listening to and sharing music. We have to find a way to work with that and not against it. Being a small company and having the possibility to change quickly and react quickly is a true luxury. So we try not to fight those things, we try to embrace them and redefine what Sub Pop is. nick Dwyer Can you tell us a little bit about the roster now in particular, and for the three of you, what artists are you particularly or albums are you really, really into? What are the artists that you're happy to be working with? Megan Jasper I love working with a bunch of artists but sometimes for a very different reason. Sometimes people are just so extraordinary that you just... It's just fun to be with them. There's music that I love, more than even just talking about... At least for me, the bands that I love that Sub Pop is working with, I think I love even more the fact that we can work with a band like Wolf Eyes or Comets on Fire, and at the same time work with a band like Iron and Wine and have truly two ends of the spectrum. And music that, I feel, is truly transcendent for different reasons. Nick Dwyer Also, something else that's quite interesting on the label is a man named David Cross. Megan Jasper Yeah. Megan Jasper It's not just music that Sub Pop releases. Tell us a little bit about... And I do believe it's not the first album of that kind that Sub Pop does. Megan Jasper A while ago Tony Kiewel, who's one of our A&R people, said, "I want to work with this comedian David Cross." He does the Mr. Show with this guy Bob Odenkirk and a lot of people are fans. Some people didn't know what Mr. Show was, but the people who knew were really excited and Tony literally found David Cross’ phone number, called him up and said, “Hey, would you ever think of doing a record?” And David said, “I’ve actually been dying to do a record and I would love to do one, so let’s make it happen.” The decision was made really quickly. David Cross has made Sub Pop proud for so many reasons, not just because he’s sharp and quick and on his feet all the time, but even more so that he has the balls to really talk about the things that are happening in the world in a very honest way and to call attention to George Bush or the Catholic church, many of the things that are true issues. He doesn’t gloss over for fear that it might negatively affect his career, he says, “Fuck it, these are issues that need to be addressed.” And he does it in a way that makes you laugh. For that we feel very proud to work with him. NICK DWYER Do you guys get a lot of demos? MEGAN JASPER Oh god, you have no idea. Yeah, more than we could ever make our way through. We try to listen to them sometimes, if we’re making a trip to Portland we’ll put one in after the next. After three hours we’re just like, “Uhhhhh!” Actually, we bring music that we all agree on just so you can take a break and go “Phew,” listen to two songs before you go back to the demos. Sometimes you’ll find things, sometimes there’s just one song that’s amazing and the rest is eesh. I think there are only a couple of bands that Sub Pop have worked with through listening to demos, and the last one is Hot Hot Heat. NICK DWYER What exactly are you looking for? MEGAN JASPER Whatever it is would have to be something that felt truly relevant, and not just of the moment, or not just timeless, but truly relevant. That can mean so many different things. That can mean David Cross, Sam Beam, that can mean Wolf Eyes. Something that needs to be out there, we believe, for a number of different reasons. NICK DWYER We’re coming up to 20 years now that Sub Pop has been around. What are the biggest lessons that the label has learned over those years? MEGAN JASPER The biggest one we talk about all the time is that it’s really hard to be so good at what you do. Nah, just kidding [laughter]. The biggest lesson is that you take the lessons that you learn to heart. You’re always going to fuck up, you’re always going to make mistakes, so as long as you’re making new mistakes and learning new lessons, that’s the most important thing. There are things we’ve done as a label that we’d never do again, the amount of money spent on a band, things like that. But also, you can never say never, and you have to be open, flexible and fluid, open to change, ready to change. If you think you truly understand the music industry, how it works and how to make a band successful, then you’ve dated yourself and it’s over. You always have to be learning and understand that you never know exactly how things work because you don’t. NICK DWYER We’ll wrap things up pretty soon, but tell us about your staff. Sub Pop seems – sorry if this sounds cheesy – like a great big happy family. MEGAN JASPER I actually love talking about this and I know I’ll come off like some weirdo cheerleader who you want to smack in the head. I would just please ask you not to. But I cannot believe I work with the people I work with. I think this group would appreciate it because I think there’s a similar environment here. There’s a structure, but it’s a loose structure. You can switch things up if it needs to be switched up. There are normal boundaries, but it’s a very loose structure. We don’t sit there and look at the watch when every employee comes in in the morning. There are two people who suffer from chronic tardiness and it drives people nuts, but for the most part, people come in, they do their job, they do it well. The people we have are so frigging good at their jobs. We try to promote from within and provide an environment… These guys are feeling embarrassed. MARK ARM I’m just trying to figure out who the other one is. We’ve determined one. MEGAN JASPER I’ll tell you later. [laughter] Now my mind is wandering. There are other people who had the same problem but they fixed it. We create an environment where people can put their best foot forward and develop their own strengths, determine their own job description. It can be frustrating for someone who comes in expecting a clear job description, line by line by line, but we don’t like doing that. We believe it’s better when someone comes in and though they know what’s expected, how they execute that job is up to them. They have to develop the smarts and figure out how to do what is best. When you bring in a band – and this week we had the Elected come in, talking about their new record – and you listen to people tell you what they expect from the marketing staff, and I swear I sit there and just can’t fucking believe that these people are here because they’re amazing and they understand and they get it. I feel they are talented, fun people to work with. NICK DWYER Lastly, what’s exciting about Sub Pop for the future? MEGAN JASPER I think the thing most people are excited about right now is that our boss has decided to splurge in the biggest way he ever has and he’s taking us all to New Zealand. NICK DWYER How many staff is that? MEGAN JASPER Twenty-five people. We’re just so excited, we have some people who’ve never left the country before. Alyssa never has, she’s just this incredible woman and she promised herself that by the time she turned 30 she’d make it out of the country and she’s a year out and she’s been told she’s going to New Zealand. She’s super happy, everybody is, we’re all excited. But not just about us, but the bands [laughs], there are a lot of exciting things happening now. Phil has been helping out with the new Shins record that’s coming out next year. Sam Beam, who’s incredibly prolific, is finishing up a tour, then he’s putting out a new record. There’s a new Wolf Eyes record coming soon, lots of great things happening. And you know the Flight of the Conchords. We signed them and the Brunettes, two bands from New Zealand, and we’re really excited to bring them into the Sub Pop family. NICK DWYER Megan, Mark and Carly, thank you very much for joining us. [applause]

Title: Tony Dawsey

Tony Dawsey
Tony Dawsey is the guy that people like DJ Premier and Jay-Z (and many, many others) look to when they need perfect sound for their records. You could spend hours with this super-humble New York engineer talking about frequencies, analog versus digital, half-inch tapes and studio monitors to try to catch any possible secret of mastering. But through his sharp and on-point answers in this lecture at the 2004 Red Bull Music Academy, you’ll mostly find out that mastering is not a magical process but rather the “icing on the cake.” A very tasty one though, in this case.
Hosted by Jeff “Chairman” Mao Our guest today, you've inevitably heard his work on various projects, too numerous to name, but if you've ever heard any records by Jay-Z, or productions by DJ Premier, or even the trailer to the film Gladiator, you've probably encountered his stuff, we're very excited to have him here, so please welcome Mr. Tony Dawsey. [applause] Tony Dawsey Thank you, thank you, I appreciate it, thank you. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So Tony, your field, your profession, sound mastering. If I was from outer space and I came down and saw your name on a record, how would you explain in the most fundamental terms to me what it is that you do? How come your name is everywhere? What do you do? Tony Dawsey Well, to me, mastering is like icing on the cake. I say that to quite a few people because it’s something that is very understandable. If you ever had some cake before, a little icing on it, if it’s a good cake, makes it that much better. And that’s what we do in the mastering stage. I’ll take what people give me and I try to make it a little bit better. A little sounding better all across the board. It’s a craft, it takes a lot of time. For years, I worked at being where I’m at. It’s not something that happens overnight, so to speak. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now, you work at Masterdisk. What are some of the other well-known mastering houses in New York along with Masterdisk that people would probably be familiar with? Tony Dawsey Definitely Sterling Sound. They are our competition. There is a lot of them now. With the Pro Tools machine coming along, there is a lot of them who opened up over the last few years. But in New York, you have Sterling Sound, Masterdisk, you have The Hit Factory, Absolute Audio. There is a quite few of them, really quite a few of them. There is also a lot of them that have a Pro Tools rig and they're calling themselves mastering engineers now. There is quite a few of them also. They range from all over the place, you have the low-budget ones as well as the high-end stuff. Masterdisk likes to think that we’re one of the best. There are about six engineers that work there along with myself and a wide range of music. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Who are some of the other guys who work over there? Tony Dawsey Everybody's familiar with Howie Weinberg, who does a lot of stuff like Nirvana and all that type of stuff, the Beastie Boys. There is also Andy VanDette. There is Dave Kutch there now. Lately, unfortunately, we've had one room that has been rotating with a lot of engineers. For a while, it was Leon Zervos, Greg Calbi. We once had Bob Ludwig, who is still regarded as one of the better mastering engineers out there. He left and opened up his own place up in Maine. Jeff “Chairman” Mao OK, OK, and he is still working though, he is doing stuff like Bruce Springsteen? Tony Dawsey He is doing a lot of big, big rock stuff. People that don't have a budget when they want to master records. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. Well, I think your story is pretty interesting and how you got into this. Maybe you could you jump into that? You’ve been a music fan your whole life, but it wasn’t like being a sound engineer was your goal from the start... So, maybe you could tell everybody how you got started in the business? Tony Dawsey It’s been an interesting journey, I guess. I didn’t start out wanting to be a mastering engineer or engineer, period. At this stage of my life, I thought I’d be a photographer, really. That’s what I wanted to do when I left high school, is to get into advertising or fashion photography. But what happened is, I got a job at Masterdisk as a messenger/mail-room person to support me through photography school. And a month later they started showing me how to do things in the music world. Back then in the day–I’ve been there for 24 years now, I started in 1980–back then, quarter-inch tape copies were the standard way to make cassettes from. And that’s what I started doing way back then. Making cassettes, reel-to-reel tapes and so forth. And one thing led to another. I put the camera down, and I got involved in the mastering end of the business. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So that is pretty remarkable, starting in the mail room and now you got your own room at Masterdisk. You’ve been there for 20+ years. From doing the tape copying, how did it progress as far as you learning the ropes and everything? Tony Dawsey Well, at first I want to say that I’m a very lucky and blessed man. I want that to be known. Music has always been a big part of my life. Always. From way, way back. As a kid, my mom used to go to work at like midnight and she would turn the radio on and leave it on in the house. So, not only did I go to bed to music, I woke up to music. As a young man–growing up as an 11-, 12-year-old—the group of guys I hung out with, that's all we did was listen to music. We’d go to each other’s house and just play music. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You grew up in New York? Tony Dawsey I grew up in New York, Spanish Harlem. Back then, records were only four dollars. So, me and the group of guys I grew up with, that’s what we did. We got money–I used to work at a paper route as an 11-year-old and we’d go downtown and buy records for four dollars. All types of music: Hamilton Bohannon, James Brown, The Stylistics, Parliament/Funkadelic, all that type of stuff. Records were cheap and that’s what we did. Listen to music, music, music all day and all night. I ended up leaving New York City and went away to a prep school in Maine. And while I was there, I got involved in a show called “American Spirit,” where we used to tour up and down the East Coast all the time. Again, it was a nice experience to learn and so forth. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You said “show.” What type of show? You know, was it a traveling review or something? Tony Dawsey Yes, it was a musical revival. We did song and dance and were driving up the East Coast during the summers and even throughout the year. So, that was just another bit of exposure to the music business. And again, I didn’t think I’d be involved into it, I did until I’d set out to do so. Leaving that school, I wanted to be a photographer. That’s what I wanted to do. But all stages of my life I felt like, it's helped lead me to where I’m at now. Whether we’re talking about my mother leaving the radio on at night, me buying records as a young man with the group of guys I hung out with and then being involved in that show. When I got a job at Masterdisk, it was just to support me through photography school. And back then in New York, the club scene was really happenin’ it was really poppin’. I spent a lot of time at clubs dancing and having fun and doing things that a 18-year-old person did. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What places did you go out to back then? Tony Dawsey Oh boy! There was a whole lot of clubs. You know, some people call ’em “discos”–I hate that name. We just called them “clubs.” A place where people go and meet to dance and have fun. It was Paradise Garage, Justine’s, Neil Gwinn's. Just a tremendous amount of clubs and a big party scene in New York. It’s not quite like that anymore. But all of that stuff I think, contributed to me knowing what sounded good, and then, as I started at Masterdisk and I got involved in this, I was trained by some very good individuals: Bob Ludwig, Bill Kipper, Alan Moy. I just saw it as a plus: I was like, “I can do this!” The more I learned and everything, I was like, “I can do this because I felt I know what sounds good.” You know, it was just a matter of learning the equipment and then perfecting my craft, so to speak. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you remember what the first record was you worked on? Tony Dawsey I really don’t remember. Because what happened back then is people who had a preference would call up and choose to work with one of several different engineers. And we had something called “C.O.D. clients,” who were people who came in off the street and just wanted their record mastered. They didn’t care who did it, really. And that’s what I did. I started out doing those type of records all the time. Before I progressed into making a name for myself and having a clientele. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So that would be any genre pretty much? Whatever the person wanted? Tony Dawsey All types of music, all types and everything. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Well then, I guess, you know, walk us through the process. Has it changed? How much has it changed from back then to now? Is the fundamental concept more or less the same? Tony Dawsey Technology I would say more than anything. Technology just doesn’t stand still. When I first started in the ‘80s at Masterdisk, probably 90% of the music came in on quarter-inch tape. Either 15ips or 30ips. For those of you who don’t know, ips stands for “inches per second.” From there, years later, it became half-inch. Half-inch tape. After half-inch tape, the digital age came about. It was F-1 Beta and VHS tapes. From there, we got involved to open-reel digital, came into play, and years later the CD came into play. So, it's changed quite a bit since the 1980s and now you have all kinds of digital computers are into play. In terms of people are recording and mixing their music onto that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So, the technology has obviously changed a lot. But as far as your approach to what you do, has that changed at all from back then? Tony Dawsey Not at all. As I said earlier, I feel mastering is icing on the cake. So when I get a project in from anybody, I take what you give me and I just wanna try and make it a little better, if there is room to do so. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So what constitutes “good sound” or a good-sounding record in your estimation? Tony Dawsey I think it’s important for everything to be clean. Bass-wise, I like my bass tight, punchy–not muddy and tubby so to speak. I like my top end open and airy. And the mid range nice and crisp also. The truth is, not all records aren't created equal. Some sound better than others, that’s for sure. And one of the worst things an engineer can go through is somebody to comes in with a tape that doesn’t sound very good and then tell you to make it sound like one of the better sounding records that are on the market. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What are some of the things people are coming and tell you? Tony Dawsey “Make it sound like a Dr. Dre record!” “Make It sound like a Jay-Z record,” or something like that. And it’s not easy. It’s not easy at all. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What do you say, you can’t polish... Tony Dawsey Yeah, I have a little saying to myself, “You can’t polish a turd.” If it doesn’t come in sounding somewhere in the ballpark, you just ain’t going to get it. It doesn’t work like that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You want to play anything as far citing examples? You know, we can describe sound but maybe playing it will demonstrate things a little more clearly. Tony Dawsey If people would have asked me which format I like to master from, I still really prefer half-inch 30ips. It’s just very dynamic, it’s very open and I just love it. I know in this digital age, it’s not always cost-sufficient to do that. A lot of people are coming in with DATs and CDs or computer files because it’s simple, it’s cheap. But my best-sounding records, I feel, are still done off of half-inch. There is a new technology out that is very, very expensive and people aren’t using it because of that, and that’s a one-inch tape. I was lucky enough to work on Kelly Price’s last album and it was the first record I did that was mastered off a one-inch tape. Very incredible. Incredibly dynamic, incredibly clean. I didn’t have to EQ that record much at all somehow, which I find amazing. I have a couple of diffeent little things here I want to play you, just to let you know, what I feel is something that is very dynamic. I have a Jay-Z record here. It was mastered off a half-inch, 30ips, no noise-reduction tape. I'll just play a piece of a few cuts for you, just to let you see, how dynamic it is. (music: Jay-Z - “Change the Game”) Tony Dawsey [bobs head to the beat] I love bass, I love it! I'm sorry, I can’t help it. You see me nodding a bit, and that’s what I do throughout the session. No matter if it’s jazz, R&B, whatever, I just love me some bass. And that is how I like my bass to sound: Just like that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What else do you want to say about that particular track as an example of what you find ideal? Tony Dawsey What I love about that stuff is the dynamic range. You have a very, very low octave of bass and yet you still have a lot of top end in there too. And that is to me a good recording, mixing and mastering job. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now that was all brought in, though, already sounding decent to you. So like you said, it’s really only what you said, sort of maximizing what is already there. Do you want to play anything else off of this? (music: Jay-Z - “I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me”) (music: Jay-Z - “Excuse Me Miss”) Tony Dawsey Well, back in the day, back in the early ‘80s and so forth and you go through up the ‘90s, let’s say you have an album come in on half-inch tape; it was normally done with one engineer, and one studio and perhaps with one producer. So, it was very, very consistent all across the board. These days, you can have an album that is 15 tracks and you could have seven different producers and it could be done in ten different studios across the country. That makes it a little bit more challenging to get it very consistent across the board. Because as I said before, all mixes are not created equal. So that seems to be the biggest challenge these days to mastering engineers is to try to get a project a bit consistent from track to track. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So what do you do? What’s the most severe sort of example of there being real disparate sounds on one record that you can maybe remember? Tony Dawsey In addition to some engineers are better than others, some studios are better than others. So, you may be only boosting one track a couple of dB of top end, and in the next track you may have to boost it four dB to keep it in synch with the other one. So, it’s a lot more challenging for sure. And I definitely think music was a lot more consistent when you had one studio, one format and one engineer so to speak. Jeff “Chairman” Mao In this hip-hop era, is that more of a concern? It seems like with a lot of hip-hop albums you do have that example, but with live instrumentation is that also as severe or sort of an issue to deal with? Tony Dawsey Yeah, because you run into a problem where people ask you, “How come this track doesn’t sound as good as that track?” You know? Well, that track isn’t mixed as well as this track. This track was mixed at a not-as-good of a studio as that one. Sometimes people don’t understand that. A&R people, record company people–they don’t understand that stuff. And it’s your job to make it happen. To do what the hell you got to do to get it a little more consistent. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So, how is the person, you know, that come in and you would work with? It’s not always a producer or artist. Who is the person? Tony Dawsey It’s one of four, if not all of them. You normally have somebody from the record company come in. Sometimes, one of the engineers of the project will come in, just to make sure that his stuff is right. Sometimes the artist comes in or a producer will come in, so you have a wide range of different people. Sometimes you have a room with ten different people in there. Everybody just wanting the best for the project Jeff “Chairman” Mao I’m sure you love that when there is ten different people there? [laughs] Tony Dawsey Well, it’s not easy because everybody wants their stuff sounding right. Which is okay, that’s what we all want in common, but it’s difficult sometimes. If you thinking about trying to please ten different people and all, it’s just sometimes it's impossible. You'll get nine people happy about the way the track sounds and you get this one person saying that they want the bell to be louder or something like that. It’s a little crazy at times, but it’s part of what you do and you got to make the best of it. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Who’s been most hands-on from your experience? As far as producers or whoever, artists that you've worked with? Tony Dawsey Wow, it’s funny. I can probably name quite a few of them, but I know guys like DJ Premier. He is there from the start of the session to the end. He is very much hands-on, involved in everything that you’re doing, tellin’ you to do this or that, making suggestions. Reggie Noble is another one. When Premier and Reggie Noble are coming in, I know that I’m going to be there until five or six in the morning, unfortunately. I’m mastering records, and Reggie is, “I’m running down the street real quick and getting a sound effect for my skit,” or something. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Reggie Noble known to the public as... Tony Dawsey Redman. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What are some of the other things they'll going to say to you? Is there a consistent thing? Do you know when these guys come in that “I have to do it this certain way?" Tony Dawsey Definitely so with hip-hop more so than other things. They want that bass banging. They want it tight, they want it loud, they want it punchy. You heard some of the Jay-Z stuff I had been playing. Let me just play this for an example of something that doesn’t sound as good. And it’s no diss to this person, but… (music: Jay-Z - “Get Your Mind Right Mami”) Tony Dawsey Now I’m going to play something for you and this was a very big record. It didn’t come in sounding good and it doesn’t sound good. So, you got a vibe, a little taste of Jay-Z and how I like records to sound. I’m going to play a record that sold about 12 million copies in the United States. It didn’t come in sounding good and you’re going to see the difference. It's no diss to this person. If they find out about this, they’re probably never going to work with me again, and this record was a very big record, like I said. It sold 12 million copies and so forth, but if you listen to what the music sounds like on here, you won’t get the same vibe you just got from the Jay-Z record. (music: Kid Rock - “Cowboy”) Jeff “Chairman” Mao So, how long did you go at it then to try to get it to a place where you could be satisfied? Tony Dawsey I’d say, I normally can EQ a track where I'm happy and the people in the room are happy. I‘d say I listen to it three to five times or something like that and in the course of that, I EQ a record and get it sounding good. This took a little bit longer. It was a longer session, it took a lot more time. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now after the session–you have your standard–it obviously came out, and it didn’t bother 12 million record purchasers. What was the client saying? Were they cool with it? Tony Dawsey They were happy with it. I mean, when I EQ something, the people in my room, I play it beforehand and then I play it with EQ. So, right then and there, the people... Andy Karp came in on this, he is the A&R guy on Lava Records. Like I’d said, I’d play the record flat and with the output on the console with the EQ so you hear the difference right then and there. And they were very happy with this record. I mean, I saw him not very long ago and he was talkin’ about, “This is the guy who put the bass on our record,” and so forth. [smiles] It wasn’t quite the way I would have liked it to sound. And of course, all records aren’t created equal. I don’t try to master every record to sound like a Jay-Z record. I just don't. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I noticed that the rapping is a little bit better on this Jay-Z album, too. [laughs] What could you have done... Tony Dawsey You didn’t hear me say that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Why couldn’t you help that aspect of this record? Tony Dawsey Nah, I don’t get that involved so to speak, with the people [laughs]. Jeff “Chairman” Mao As far as the hip-hop thing goes, being a professional in this industry... Well, let me ask you this first: Your career predates hip-hop somewhat, as far being what it is now. Did you bring something different to the table or have to hear things with a different ear to work on hip-hop records as opposed to other genres? Tony Dawsey It’s kind of funny. Back in the ‘80s when I started equalizing records and mastering records and so forth, I was doing a lot of rock & roll. Then there was a time, where I was doing a lot of heavy metal and there was a point where I was doing a lot of jazz. And then, what happens is you get your name on a few records that sell a lot of copies, and then everybody wants to be a part of that. Back in 1987, I had my first #1 album that was the La Bamba soundtrack. [Audience laughs] You know, something totally different. Years after that, I started doing the Das EFX, the Redmans, stuff like that. And, of course, a lot of those records sold very well and all, and then people just gravitated to you and wanted to be a part of that. The thing most engineers hate about it is that you get kind of categorized and put into that mode. I like all types of music, to be honest with you. Most of you will probably be surprised to know that when I’m home, relaxin', chillin’, I listen to a group called Fourplay. I love their music, all their albums. My daughter is constantly saying to me, “Dad, all you listen to is Fourplay.” I said, “Baby, they got eight albums. That is a lot of music to listen to.” [Audience laughs] And I love that type of stuff. The music I’m listening to is really a reflection of my mood. I can go and listen from a Fourplay album to Yes, a little Dr. Dre or whatever. It depends on my mood, really. Jeff “Chairman” Mao But as far as the standards for hip-hop sounds, is it different? Do you bring something different to it than if you’re working in another genre or are you approaching it the exact same way? Tony Dawsey I don’t approach music any different, I really don’t, regardless of what type it is. I just take what the people give me. Out of the recording, out of the mixing session, I just want to try and make it sound a little better. I’ve been doing this for a long time so I bring a certain amount of experience to the table. And instantly, when I'm playing something back in my room, I go, “Uh, it needs a little boost on the top end,” and I start working on that. Or if I notice the bass needs a big boost, I immediately attack that. But I don’t have a different approach from one type of music to another. I really don’t, you know? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Yeah, you said not all records are created equal. I know that some producers in hip-hop are particularly known to have a grimy sound. Somebody like Wu-Tang, the RZA being one of those people. Have you had any experiences working with him? Tony Dawsey I had done a few of the records earlier with him. And you’re absolutely right, there is a griminess that he has. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Because if you play these records in a club, there is going to be an obvious sonic difference between playing these records. Tony Dawsey Definitely, you are right. I don’t know, if it’s done on purpose or it’s just the engineer/equipment that's used. But the RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan's records are definitely a bit grimy. It’s not that nice, tight, punchy bass that I love so much. A lot of people feel that’s his sound, that’s his style. I can’t tell you that that's done on purpose, I’m not sure it is. It’s just the way it turns out, I think. Same thing as you just heard with the Kid Rock record versus the Jay-Z. I think everybody wants to sound their record sounding as good as possible. Nice, tight, punchy bass, nice open top end and some crisp mids, but it doesn’t always happen that way, unfortunately. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I know that from working with rap people that there's different challenges as far as the etiquette goes sometimes. Can you probably elaborate on a couple examples? You don’t have to name names, but particular examples, particularly egregious when you came in thinking you were gonna be professional and prepared and maybe it didn’t turn out that way? Tony Dawsey [laughs] I guess the first thing that is obvious when dealing with–and I guess this happens more so with hip-hop than it does with other music–is just people being on time. Normally, I start my day at 11 or 12 o’clock. And quite a few people would show up at three or four o’clock. It’s kind of rough in terms of having a life and planning things afterwards. Because in this business, you just can’t do that. Like I said, my day normally starts between 11 and 12 o’clock and if I’m lucky, it ends between eight and ten o’clock. But many a instance, you're there until three, four, five o’clock in the morning. I can remember in the early days working with DJ Premier and maybe having something to do after work and trying to kind of rush a little bit, and it just didn’t work out. The more I rushed him, the more he went off to play some pool or got on the phone and made phone calls, so I learned not to make plans after work and just take it a song at a time, you know? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Were there any other people who were particularly memorable as far as like being in the studio? Did Jay-Z ever show up to his mastering sessions? I mean, are they following through as artists? Are they that far into the process or are they pretty much delegating responsibility at that point? Tony Dawsey It really depends on the individual. I think I worked on the last five Jay-Z records. And the first time I met him was when I was working on the first DMX album. He came in just to say “hi” and show a little support. Out of the five albums I have done on his, he came in on the last one, the one which he was supposed to be retiring from the business. He came in to, I guess, make sure that things were okay. Jeff “Chairman” Mao It was a good thing he showed before he retired. Otherwise you might have never seen him again, right? Tony Dawsey [laughs] Exactly. Other than that, they normally depend on somebody to get the job done. Whether it’s an A&R person, an engineer or one of the producers and so forth. But it’s different with everybody. Sometimes the artists will come in themselves to oversee their project, but you can always depend on a record company person being there. Almost always. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Is that a good thing? Or is that a bad thing? Tony Dawsey No, I don’t mind working with people at all, I really don’t. It’s a very creative atmosphere and I just don’t have a problem with that. But I have a very nice room. You can check it out on the website, it’s very comfortable. Masterdisk, we feed our clientele, we have a pool table, conference room table, a computer. And we just try to make it very comfortable for people. And I’m a very easygoing guy, and all I want to do is to make your record sound the best it possibly can. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Now, as far as the length of a session goes or the time, you said yesterday you have some specific preferences that probably make a lot of sense as far as when you start your day at 11 or 12, that you don’t want to be doing what you’re doing. Can you elaborate a little bit about that? Tony Dawsey I definitely don't wanna be mastering your record at four o’clock in the morning. I’m a human being and us human beings get tired. It’s that simple. I know a lot of guys that mix and record a lot of times are put under the gun and you'll being in the studio for 12, 14, 16 hours to get the job done. Those mixes don’t normally turn out to be very good. So, you guys out here who are planning on mixing and recording, try not to do that. ’Cause what happens as human beings is the top ends disappear. So what do you do? You turn it up some, and the next day when you get back to the project, you wonder why the hell is so bright. So, if possible, I say stay away from that four o’clock, five o’clock in the morning crap. And find out within yourself, if eight hours is enough for you, if ten hours is enough, before you get a little burn out. I know, it’s easy for me to tell you this and to say that, but a lot of times you’re under the gun. The record companies putting pressure on you to “Get it done, to get it done. This record has to be put in tomorrow at 12 noon.” So, you end up doing what you have to do. But I can’t say most of the time those mixes turn out very well. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So if you’re put in a situation like that, what do you do to keep your ears fresh? Tony Dawsey I drink a lot of water. I may walk away and take a break here and there. And I definitely don’t monitor very loudly. A lot of people feel like they have to turn it up crazy loud. To me, all you're doing is testing out your speakers and the amplifiers and making yourself a little bit tired. We’re human beings, we’re not machines. A machine can go all day and all night, but we're human and we cannot do that. But most of the time, the last few hours of a session, you’re putting a record together and you make the copy. So even if I’m in the studio with Redman or DJ Premier to six in the morning, the last few hours are in fact, like I said, putting the record together and making the copies of it. Back in the day, when I told you about a project coming in on a half-inch or quarter-inch reel of tape, and being from one studio and one engineer, we used to be able to master an album in four hours. Back in the day. These days, it’s not the case. It used to also be anywhere from eight to 12 cuts on an album. These days it could be up to 20 cuts and so forth on the album. Therefore albums tend to go from eight hours on up and so forth. It definitely has changed in the game in that regard. And like I said, the fact that you get tapes coming in from studios all across the land, with different producers and all that, makes the sessions go a lot longer also. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You are raising your hand urgently... Audience Member Can you give an example of how loud you monitor? Play sound and say like this...? Tony Dawsey It’s a kind of a different set-up in here, but back in my studio I have three different types of speakers. I have some nice Genelecs sitting on the console right there, couple of feet from me. I have a big system in the back of the room and I have some nice small KRK monitors, which are nice for people sitting on the couch. Now, during the course of a session, I bounce around to all three of those. Certain people come in and they gonna turn up the music and I have to accept that. Like DJ Premier always turns it all the way up. That’s what he does. There is nothing that I can do about that. But as I EQ, I just play the normal listening level. Soemthing just... (music: Kid Rock - “Devil Without A Cause”) Audience Member I was just wondering since you're getting a finished mix, if the vocals aren’t loud enough, will you request that they give you another mix with the vocals are louder or will you just EQ it a little bit different? Tony Dawsey The thing with mastering is, even while we're able to boost a lot of things in the mids, top end and in the bass, vocal is somewhat a real sticky area. If, let’s say the vocal level is two dB lower than what it should be, I cannot make up that two dB level EQ-wise. A good engineer will cover his ass, so to speak. On the master tape that they give you, they'll have a vocal up version, normally one db. It would be even smarter to have a couple of different ones. All it takes is a little bit of time. And it's a lot less time to print a vocal up one db, a vocal up two db, as it would for you to go back in and redo that. So, if time permits it, I would definitely suggest you do it like that. Is have your one vocal level, but then go and do it up a dB or two, just to cover yourself. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So you were saying early that people are not going to Masterdisk or any of those mastering houses, but are trying to go the cheap way or technologies afford them easier ways to do things. What are the drawbacks of people doing that? Tony Dawsey I’d say about 95% of the music I work on, I use an analog console. I have an old Neumann analog console with a whole lot of different equalizers and compressors. A lot of people these days are mastering their records in the Pro Tools machine that has a mastering menu. And it’s just not the same. I have done some tests. I remember engineer Richard Keller came in with the DMX album and we mastered on my console first or through my console. Then we went back and mastered in the Pro Tools machine. It’s just the warmth that you get off my analog console that you can’t get off of that Pro Tools machine or these computers that people have these days. I don’t know what to tell you about that. I think, it’s still something kind of new, I guess. The whole Pro Tools mastering thing. That machine is pretty incredible. It's helped to close down a lot of studios throughout the land, unfortunately. Because for ten or 20 grand, you can buy that machine and have your mixing console, your recording and everything just there. So, unfortunately, a lot of good studios in New York, as well as California and probably everywhere in-between are closing down because of that machine. The mastering menu, I still feel, has a way to go before you'll be on a level to get it where it's like what most of us can achieve at our console. I don’t know, I recently had some people calling me and telling me that they want to open up a mastering suite using a Pro Tools rig, but the guy was saying, I guess he was an engineer, “I can’t understand why I can’t get it to sound as good as some of your records?” And I was like: “Hmmm, that’s why I get the big bucks, I guess, you know?” [laughs] I’m not saying that you have to spend a lot of money to get your record mastered right, but there’s a level of difference, you know? I’ve been doing this for 20-something years. The Pro Tools rig has not been around that long. So, I’d say no matter what you're choosing to do, whether it’s recording, mixing or mastering, I think, it’s very important for you to spend the time to perfect your craft. You’re not going to be good overnight. We all have egos to some degree and all that, but it takes time. It takes time to be very, very good in what you do. So, I say, do your homework and put in your time to get to that level of excellence no matter what you choose to do. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you think that inevitably this technology is gonna improve to where they can give you that kind of warmth, the Pro Tools technology? Tony Dawsey I wouldn’t be surprised that it would. Something I realized in the years I’ve been doing, is that technology just doesn’t stop. On the consumer end as well as on the professional end. They are always coming out with something at the consumer end to get your money. I can remember, what was it? Used to be just Vinyl and cassettes. And then in ‘83 I bought my first CD player. After that I remember the minidisc came, digital compact cassette, just all kinds of stuff. On the consumer end they always try something to get your money. Now you have high-definition CDs and everything else. On the professional end, if you pick up Mix magazine from month to month, I feel sorry for studio owners because there is always another pair of speakers, there is always another amplifier, another mic or something that they are trying to sell you to make the whole recording process better. I think in years to come... I mean, the Pro Tools rig has come a long way from when they first came out. When that thing first came out, we had a choice to choose that machine, but we choose Sonic Solutions, we use it as a hard disk editing system. George Lucas of Star Wars fame invented it for video. We use it for music. That hasn’t kept up with technology. The Pro Tools rig has surpassed that and so I wouldn’t be surprised, if in years to come, the software gets better and that machine will perhaps take over some of the mastering studios. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So how does that make you feel on a personal level then as a direct thread to what you do? Tony Dawsey Well, like I said, I can’t stop technology and I know one day I won’t be mastering records anymore. I don’t have a problem with that. But I’m going to do it as long as I can and you kind of get what you pay for. I mean, yes, you can buy a Volkswagen or you can buy a Mercedes. They are both cars, but are they both the same? No, no. That’s the truth. Just like that person who called up asking, “Well I have a Pro Tools rig, I want to do mastering. Why can’t I make my records sound as good as yours?” There is a difference. It’s definitely a difference. I still prefer my analog console, I am not going to invest time into mastering off the Pro Tools rig. At this point at least, I’m not. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You talked a little bit about fatigue, ear fatigue, do you do anything to keep your ears specifically [protected] besides when you’re in the studio? Do you listen to music a lot in your spare time? Tony Dawsey In some ways I miss that. I think growing up as a young man, as a teenager, I think I listened and enjoyed music a lot more, now it’s what I do for a living. I may turn on the radio on the hour drive in to work and the hour drive home, but I don’t listen to music in my spare time as much as I used to. And I miss that sometimes, you know, I miss that. But sometimes I just need a little break, I guess. I’m not one to play music loud loud all the time, I just play it at an easy listening level and I think that makes a big difference. Not to say I don’t listen to music loud because sometimes you’ll see this crazy guy driving down the highway nodding his head to some jam that he’s crazy about so I can crank it up at times. And definitely, if I go to concerts and to a club or something, I tend to stay away from the speakers because they definitely turn them up loud there. So I’ll back off from that not to damage my ears so to speak. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You said to me you try not to listen with a critical ear as far as aesthetics go, but there must be times when you’re sitting there working on something and you just can’t stand the song or can’t stand the artist. And it’s got to be a challenge to try to overcome that to try to make it sound as good as you can. Tony Dawsey Well, I think you got to be professional, you just got to be professional. I think you get a point or two for bringing a record and me mastering it. So right off the bat I like it because of that. I can’t say I listen to a lot of offensive stuff, although I have a 12-year-old daughter and sometimes dealing with some of the rap stuff more than anything you get a little tired of hearing the “bitches, hoes, ass, fuck, shit, nigger” and all that stuff all the time, that gets a little monotonous. But you know, in our country there's something called free speech so you got to deal with it. I think regardless of what I get, you just have to be professional. Years ago when I used to do heavy metal...that’s not my choice of music, I’m not going to listen to that when I’m home relaxing but you got to be professional about it, you know? Jeff “Chairman” Mao There’s always a visual stereotype of an engineer being the white guy with the ponytail and facial hair. So is that a true stereotype from your experience or is it fiction, do you feel like you’ve broken some boundaries for the time that you were working at Masterdisk, when you came in? Tony Dawsey Probably not, I still get a lot of people coming in going, like “You’re black!” I’ve been on MTV, people are surprised. I don’t know why, we have a website, my picture’s on there, I’ve been on MTV talking about music before, what was it? The 22 greatest albums a panel voted in on and I was on there talking about a Nine Inch Nails record. But alot of people are surprised. And there are only two African-American engineers that I feel make an impact in the music business. That’s myself and Herb Powers. So I guess it’s not normal for a black engineer to be mastering records. Hopefully in the years to come, that’ll change. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Describe Herb Powers and what his importance is because I know if anybody here buys any dance records–12”s from the early ‘80s–this guy's name is pretty much on everything significant. If you could talk a little bit about his impact too? Tony Dawsey I consider him a friend. Many years ago when I was delivering packages throughout the different recording studios in New York, I ran into him in a control room, the mastering suite at Frankford Wayne and I was like, “Wow!” It kind of inspired me to go forth and do what I do now because I just felt like wow, there is a brother doing this, so it is feasible, it is possible. When I first started at Masterdisk, again, I had no aspiration to do mastering at all but I do remember seeing Herb in there and it was definitely a bit of an inspiration to go forth and to perhaps take advantage of the situation that was given to me. I have seen quite a bit of differences, still in the business where there are a lot more black mixing and recording engineers than what there used to be when I first started. Like you said, it used to be the ponytail with the grub on the face and that’s not true anymore. The beautiful thing I feel about music, and you’ve heard people say this before and it may be a cliché, but music is a universal language. I really, really feel that way. You don’t listen to music and go, oh, it’s a black thing, a white thing, an Asian thing or anything else. Music just speaks to all of us, all across the board, all parts of the country. That’s the thing I love about it so much. And it’s a little different than when I was growing up. Growing up, if you had some type of relationship with your girlfriend, there was a record that spoke to you about it, that you could relate to. And there are still records now that impact and affect people like that. Whether you’re going through something with your boyfriend/girlfriend or just something in life, and that’s why I just love music so much and I always have. It touches you, it kinda reaches down to your soul. Audience Member You said before that you had your first hit record with the La Bamba soundtrack, which was actually a compilation, Los Lobos. So how do you approach mastering a compilation, which is not just simply different studios, but also different artists and different sounds? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Different genres maybe, even? Tony Dawsey Well even that, again, that was back in the ‘80s, and if I remember right–it was a long time ago–it all came in from one source, from one studio. Yeah, there are different artists on each track but again, I don’t have a different approach from cut to cut. I feel a large percentage... Audience Member You have to create a homogenous sound but at the same time respect the individuality of the single artists? Tony Dawsey That’s correct. But again, like I say, I think a large portion of what I do is already done in the actual recording and the actual mixing. So most of the work is already done and I’m just there–as I’ve been saying–putting the icing on the cake. I just want to try to keep it as consistent as possible but in listening to it, do what I feel needs to be done whether that’s boosting the top, the bass or whatever. It’s not easy these days, like I said, you get a project with 20 cuts done and it's done in ten different studios with different producers, but it’s what I do and I just have to try and keep it as consistent as possible across the board. And it’s not easy, it’s probably a lot more easy to say that than what it is. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Did you ever have any ambitions to do recording engineering or producing yourself? Tony Dawsey Sometimes I wish I got involved in mixing because I’ve hung out in different studios watching records being put together. That to me is crazy, crazy... What’s the right word I’m thinking of? It’s just crazy creative at that point, I mean here you are and you’re combining the 24 or 48 tracks onto a left and right channel and that’s just very, very creative to me. Like I said, when I get it, two thirds of it is already done, I’m just putting a little glaze of icing on it and all. But sometimes I wish I did mix some, I really do ’cause I think it’s just a lot more creative than what I do. As far as producing and all that stuff, I think I’m starting to be a little too old to want to venture into all that stuff now. And I thought about it even in the mixing sense, I would end up not being home and I have a wife and a daughter, you know I already work ten or more hours a day. I try not to work the weekends, but if I got involved in mixing, then I’m sure I would never be home. And then I would end up perhaps ruffling a few feathers on people I work with. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What about the whole concept of re-mastering, what is your experience of that? I mean sometimes you hear a re-issue of a classic album and they say: “Re-Mastered, blah, blah, blah.” Sometimes there’s a difference and sometimes it sounds negligible. What is your experience with that? Tony Dawsey Well, I think again, technology comes into play. I think records these days are crazy, crazy loud, much louder than they were in the ‘80s. Some of that is because of different types of equipment that are available to you and everything else. And I think that’s some of why a lot of companies re-issue and remaster stuff that was perhaps done back in the ‘60s, ‘70s or ‘80s, just to bring it up to sync with what today’s sound is more like. I don’t really like the loudness that people put on records these days, I think that a lot of times it destroys the dynamic-ness of the record. If I played a jazz record for you that I mastered, I will never make that record as loud as I do perhaps a hip-hop record. A lot of the hip-hop guys, they want their record sounding louder than the next and the next and the next on down the line. But to me you lose a bit of the dynamic-ness of your music by doing that. I do what I have to do, if that’s what the client wants, then that’s what they want. But you just lose it. If I play some jazz stuff that I’ve done recently for you, you’ll find it very open, very dynamic and very pleasing but when you squash a record to make it sound loud, I just think you mess up on stuff. It just loses that and a lot of people feel that way but you get caught up on doing what the client wants and just making them happy. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Have you heard any of the hip-hop remasters, records from ten years ago like Nas’ Illmatic that have supposedly been remastered. Have you heard any of that stuff or ever compared...? Tony Dawsey No, I can’t say I do. To me that’s kind of work and when I’m listening to music in my car or at home, I try my best not to be critical or judgmental about it. I just play it and I either enjoy it and like the vibe or I don’t. ’Cause that’s how I started with this, I didn’t start out listening to music going, “Ooh, it doesn’t sound good,” or “Ooh, it needs more top end,” or whatever. So when I’m home on my own, I try my best not to do that. I can’t say I bought any re-issues of stuff that’s been remastered, I can’t say that at all. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Why don’t you play something, another example, maybe one of your jazz pieces or something like that to give us another audio example of what you’re talking about? Tony Dawsey OK, before I do that, what I would love to play for you guys is... You’ve heard I played some Jay-Z’s Dynasty album, I played some of Kid Rock’s. Both of those records were mixed down to half-inch 30ips and again I love that format. If you ask me what I prefer to master from, that’s what it is. I want to play something for you that was using this new technology. I’m not sure of the gentleman’s name but somebody invented a one-inch machine. (music: Kelly Price - unknown) It’s a very sticky situation, it really is. Because I think if you going to have a certain person that you want to master your record, then you should have them cut the vinyl too. And again, explain as to what you just said to me and hopefully they can work out and give you a deal. Because sometimes what happens, I've had with people is I won’t cut the vinyl, they’ll broker it off with somebody else and then wonder why it doesn’t sound right. Just as I talked a lot about the half-inch analog tape machine and how the key to that sounding really good is to have it aligned and taken care of, the same thing is true with cutting a piece of vinyl. There’s a high frequency alignment, there’s a total alignment that needs to be done on those machines, and if it’s not done right, then there’s no telling how your stuff is going to turn out. So who they use–and you have every right to ask them–who are you using to cut the vinyl and everything else? That’s important, for sure. A lot of studios, not just Masterdisk in New York, but a lot of studios are offering breaks to people these days, you’d be surprised. So like I said, just call up a place and explain your situation and if you have a list of engineers, mastering guys that you want to do it, then you have every right spending your money to request engineer A, B, C, D. If somebody wants to work with me, I won’t pass it off on to somebody else, I’ll accommodate the client as best as I can. I don’t care who you are, from Jay-Z on down to the other guy because I didn’t start out up here, so I understand people starting there wanting to go up. And I’ll give you the same type of respect and care that I would for the big budget people, you know I think that’s fair, I really do. Audience Member Thank you very much. See you in New York, too! Tony Dawsey You’re welcome. Audience Member I was just wondering if you could run down some of the differences between mastering for vinyl. You don’t want the bass to be on one side and you’ve got phasing things with the bass. A lot of people don’t realize these differences, can you explain some of those things? Tony Dawsey Oh, yeah. There could be a lot of problems... I don’t necessarily change the EQ when I’m doing something for CD versus vinyl. What you’ll find is, let’s say you have five tracks on your album that you want to put on vinyl [and] let’s say the fifth track has a lot of top-end and high frequency stuff going on, cymbals, and all that fun stuff. With vinyl you get into a problem with inner-band distortion that doesn’t exist on a CD. On a CD you can make it crazy loud and all type of top end without it being a problem. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Inner-band distortion? Tony Dawsey Yeah, when it comes down to vinyl, you have to deal with problems like that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao In layman’s terms what would that be? Tony Dawsey It’s just that as you get towards the centre of the record, if you have something with a lot of top end, it could possibly distort on you at a very high level. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So, if you’ve got three tracks on a 12", the one closest to the label [will distort on the top end]? Tony Dawsey It’s very possible. Another thing that people don’t understand with vinyl is–I know a lot of you guys that are DJs–a good-sounding piece of vinyl will be in the neighborhood of ten to 12, maybe 13 minutes. When you get up to a vinl that's 17 or 18 minutes, we have to drop the level. So when they happen to play your record that’s 18 minutes versus one that’s 12 minutes, the 12 minute one will probably sound a lot better. A lot of people don’t understand that, they ask why, it’s just physics, the longer the record is, the more room it takes up on a piece of vinyl. Jeff “Chairman” Mao That’s why when you play your old vinyl copy of Fear Of A Black Planet, it sounds really shitty. Tony Dawsey Yeah, chances are that was 20-some-odd minutes. I don’t care who cut your piece of vinyl, there’s no way a 20-some-odd piece of vinyl is going to sound as good as a ten or 12-minute one, it just doesn’t work out that way. So if that’s an issue for you, then try to keep your vinyl to ten or 12 minutes. If it’s 20 minutes, then understand that it’s not going to sound as good. Back in the day when CDs weren’t in play, we used to cut a lot of vinyl that was perhaps 19, 20 minutes. But we just let the people know that’s not going to sound as good as a 12" piece of vinyl. Nowadays to combat that, I’ll master an album that’s 60 minutes long and instead of cutting it up and making two pieces of vinyl, the record company makes four pieces of vinyl. So that way each piece of vinyl is 15 minutes long, which sounds a lot better than if it’s 20 or 30 minutes long. Jeff “Chairman” Mao But then there’s a lot more expense in doing that as well, I would imagine. Tony Dawsey Yeah, that’s true. It does cost more to do four pieces of vinyl versus two and everything. But again, if sound quality is important to you, that’s just something you have to consider. And another thing: There's just a lot of different things that sometimes engineers that don’t cut vinyl don’t understand. You talked about phasing. Bass phasing for vinyl cutting engineers is a real problem. A lot of times what happens with the machine that cuts the grooves when you have some phasing going on with your bass the grooves go deep thin deep thin. [gesticulates with arms to indicate]. And, if it thins up too much, then there’s a very good chance that record’s going to skip. So it’s very possible to maybe create two different mixes or just to not make the phasing crazy, because on CD that stuff is not a problem, it’s not a problem at all. But when it comes to vinyl you get into cutting problems. Like I said, the groove getting thick, thin, thick, thin. And sometimes I’ll get a project where that happens and I go, “Oh no, I’ve got to cut this on vinyl!” But it’s something you got to deal with and we got little tricks that we do to get around that stuff sometimes. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What about with what PJ was saying before about someone giving you an honest assessment of what you have? You were saying how maybe you bring the master in or you bring your tape in or whatever, and you can only do so much in the mastering process, you actually have to go back and provide something else. You know, you’re in DC, a lot of these guys are in other parts of the world where they’re not going to be able to come down to Masterdisk or call you on the phone, it’s going to be a pretty expensive call. So what advice would you give them as a resource for that kind of feedback? Tony Dawsey Well, I always try to be professional, I’ll never come out and tell anybody that their mix is a piece of shit, I don’t think that’s fair or that's right at all. But in this day and age, people love comparing their record to another record and a lot of times the other record tends to sound a whole lot better and they want their record to sound like that. Most of the time that’s not fair. Just as I said to you before, all cars are not created equal. Yes, a Volkswagen and a Mercedes are both cars but they’re not the same. And the same thing is true with your mixes sometimes. The mastering—don't get me wrong—just as you said before, can make the difference of a record that perhaps will get played on the radio more so than one that won’t. But you’ve got to take each step of the process–the recording and the mixing and the mastering–and try and get it the best you can. Don’t be an engineer that shortcuts it and saying that, “I know my mix ain’t good but we’ll fix it in the mastering.” That drives us crazy sometimes because it just doesn’t work that way! If you want to have amongst the best-sounding records out there, then each of the three steps have to be done as well as possible. There’s no such thing as bringing in a crappy-sounding mix and when you leave mastering, somehow it turns into the best record in the world, it just doesn’t work like that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So there’s no folklore in your profession where they say, “Oh man, it came in sounding like this and he performed a miracle.” There are no examples of things like that? Tony Dawsey No, it does happen, like I said, mastering can make a world of difference, don’t get me wrong, but I’m not really convinced the mastering is what makes a hit. I think, when a so-called hit is made, it’s made when the record’s being written, it’s made when the record is being tracked at the studio and then it’s made on the end of the record company when they have a whole team of people getting off their ass and promoting the record and doing what they can to make it happen and be heard by the masses. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I’m not really asking so much in terms of commercial success or recognition, so much as on a craftsmanship level within the profession. [As in] “Did you hear, it came in sounding like crap but Tony did his thing and it’s tight now.” Are there any sort of stories like that or examples? Tony Dawsey Off the top of my head I can’t say over the years. I’m sure that’s been the case where people’s records perhaps don’t sound great when they come in, but it sounds a world better when it leaves the mastering facility. I’m sure that happens quite a bit, there are really a lot of really good mastering engineers out here. I give a lot of props to Big Bass Brian, he’s called, out in LA, I really like the way his records sound. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What has he worked on that we would know? Tony Dawsey Oh, he works on all kinds of stuff. He does all of the Dr. Dre stuff, whether it’s Eminem, Dre, all that stuff. In my CD changer now, in my car, I can’t get enough of is an album by The Black Eyed Peas. I love that record! If you ask me what record out here would you love your records to sound like it would be that one, I love that. Quite a lot of music I listen to would have his name on it. If not Herb Powers, then perhaps its Big Bass Brian. I don’t know the guy, but if I ever meet they guy, I’d definitely give him his props. I just love the way his records sound. Jeff “Chairman” Mao His stuff is very crisp to you? Tony Dawsey Yeah, it’s just the way I like it, big bass, tight, nice, open-air sounding, I just think he’s a very good engineer. Jeff “Chairman” Mao We touched on briefly the RZA or people who make intentionally grimy stuff... I know you try to be objective when you hear things, but there are genres of music and producers where that grime is what they really want. How do you deal with that? If it’s supposed to sound grimy, is there a bad way to sound grimy as opposed to a good way to sound grimy? Tony Dawsey Well again, I feel very strongly—in terms of mastering—that a large percentage of the work is done before it gets to me. People spend a lot of time recording a record and they spend a lot of time mixing it a certain way. So, I don’t go into a project wanting to change it, my ego kicks in and “I’m going to change this record and to sound like this.” I don’t do that, I accept the fact that you recorded and mixed this record a certain way for a reason and I’m just here to try to make it a little bit better, if at all possible. Like you said, sometimes people do stuff like that on purpose. I didn’t mean to diss Kid Rock earlier with that record, perhaps they really wanted it to sound that way. I just know it didn’t sound as good as I normally tend to like my records to sound. But if you spoke to that engineer, he probably did that on purpose. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Any questions at this point? Audience Member Yeah, I have about ten questions but I’ll try and keep it short to two. I was going to say did you think that [what you didn’t like about] the Kid Rock record maybe was down to the fact that it was using a lot of live instrumentation and the way they approached making that record was different to the way you’d program on an MPC or an SP-1200? Tony Dawsey I can’t really say, I know it was done in Detroit with an engineer, and I’ll probably be killed for this, but I know some other people that worked on his records and they say the same thing. The whole thing with being a good engineer is getting the best out of the equipment that you use. I can’t say what goes on in that engineer’s realm or his world but I can say to all of you that one of the most important aspects of being a good engineer is what you’re listening back on. If you’re listening to some speakers and they’re lying to you, then there’s no way in the world you’re going to end up with a good mix because what you’re hearing isn’t really correct, so that’s one phase of the game that I think that's very, very important. You just can’t overlook that. If you don’t have decent speakers that are being honest and truthful to you and your listening environment isn’t correct, then it’s almost impossible to get a good mix because what you’re EQ'ing and changing and all isn’t really true. And it may end up sounding good there but then when you go to your car or home, you [wonder] what happened. The speaker situation and your listening environment is very, very important no matter what you’re doing, whether it’s recording, mixing or mastering, it’s very, very important. Audience Member What would you say would give you the truest sound? I mean, I know you have industry standard Yamaha NS-10 speakers or Tannoy...? Tony Dawsey Aaarrrggghh! NS-10s, curse that! [makes the sign of the cross] Audience Member Well, I’m from the UK and engineers tend to mix with NS-10s in the studio or Tannoy speakers. Tony Dawsey Well, the truth is, NS-10s are a very popular speaker and damn near every studio has them. I can’t stand those speakers, I’m sorry. When I had them in my room, I get confused, I listen to them and I’m like: “What the hell am I listening to?” But the key is that a lot of guys just know how to get the best out of those speakers. And as I was just saying a little while ago, part of your craft and being good at it is learning how to get the best out of your equipment. Some engineers, they'll mix on the NS-10s and they understand it and therefore can come up with the good mix. A guy that doesn’t really know what he’s doing, the NS-10s don’t really put out a lot of bass, so unless you know better, you find guys turn up the bass a lot and then when it comes to a place like Masterdisk, it’s like, “Oh my God, there’s too much bass on it,” and the engineer did that because he wasn’t familiar with the speaker and he had to turn them up just to hear it. So it’s not a knock on NS-10s, but I just don’t like those speakers at all. But, again, they’re in every darn studio throughout the country, they’re very popular. Audience Member And my last question quickly if I can: We talked about a Pro Tools mastering software thing. Is there a problem when you’ve mixed your record ’cause I’m working with an engineer right now in the States who keeps running my mixes through a Pro Tools software mastering and he expects me to go and master it with someone like yourself who I’m planning to go speak to after the session. But is there a problem there? Mastering from Pro Tools to coming to master on an analog situation again? Tony Dawsey I think the mixing engineers should be mixing engineers and leave the mastering up to guys who master records on a regular basis. What happens a lot these days is what you just said, an engineer will do a bit of pre-mastering, so to speak, and you end up finding there’s no headroom. We get the tape, it’s slamming in terms of too loud and crunchy sounding from them compressing it or making it loud and we don’t end up having the headroom to be creative and do our thing. So that’s a real problem a lot these days but if it was up to me, tell the mixing guy to mix it, do the best he can and let the mastering go with the mastering guys. Audience Member Some people don’t know, that’s the problem, some people don’t realize it’s been run through Pro Tools mastering thing and then they bring it to someone like yourself and they have that problem. Tony Dawsey One of the engineers I work with on a lot of the stuff for the Ruff Ryders, he’ll do a little pre-mastering and give it to the guys just to listen to but when he comes to me, he’ll say use the sound file that’s not done through that. Let me go ahead master it and do my thing. I’m not knocking anybody who wants to go that route, but like I said, you just don’t get the same out of the Pro Tools mastering [compared] to what we do. Let me see, we have six rooms at my place, and all the engineers tend to use an analog console. And that’s just something you can’t get from that Pro Tools, being in the digital realm. If it was up to me, I’d say let the mixing guys be mixing guys and tell them, don't be mastering, not in the Pro Tools machine at least. Audience Member OK, thanks. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Anybody else right now? OK. Audience Member So what I wanted to ask you is when [you’re] doing mixes, especially mixes that are meant to be print on vinyl, what’s the safest low frequency you can use? For example, if you have a kick drum, should it be cut down at 50hz or 40hz, what’s the lowest frequency you can get out of a vinyl cut so [as] not to make it skip? Without using any phasing or just mono bass? Tony Dawsey Well, a low-frequency bass doesn’t necessarily cause a skip. If you listen to classical music, one of the guys that trained me did classical music all day and I can record cannon shots and all kinds of stuff that go way, way low bass so there’s nothing wrong with that. I’m not going to tell you to cut it off at 5hz or 25hz or anything. Be creative and have fun, but just know that if it’s going to vinyl, you don’t want that type of low frequency bass to be in and out of phase, that’s where you end up with problems. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So go as low as you want? Tony Dawsey Yeah, go as low as you want, be creative and have some fun. Audience Member Because often—or at least for us—when you send the CD to print on vinyl and then when you get it back, you’ll see that there has been a sharp cut on the low frequencies. So maybe, if you got some kind of popping effect or whatever, then it’s not the same when it gets back on vinyl. Have you got any advice on that? I mean, doing mixes especially for vinyl, what would you advise a mixing engineer to do if he has to mix for vinyl? Except for bass phasing there’s no other advice? Tony Dawsey I really don’t. Like I say, I cut a lot of vinyl and I don’t EQ it any different for vinyl than I do for a CD. I explained earlier the only time there may be a problem, as I get to the inner band on a piece of vinyl, if there’s a lot of top end, then there could be some inner-band distortion. Bass-wise, only if it’s in and out of phase. Sometimes you will run across an instrument that will cause a skip and so forth, and if that’s the case then the mastering guy may just have to cut a little bit of that at some point. I can’t speak for everybody, but I wouldn’t say limit yourself, be creative and have fun and if there’s any type of problem, then your mastering guy should let you know that. Audience Member OK. Just another question: When you get your mixes mastered, I know it’s better to get them on an analog board. But if you get them on a CD, which bit format is preferable? Do you prefer to get digital files like a data CD with the files printed as 24-bit resolution exported from the mixing environment, whatever it is? And how much range should be used in the dynamic range of the digital file? How much of it should be used just to not give you something that slams out to the peak level? Tony Dawsey Well, just don’t crunch it, don’t have your mix hitting so hard where it’s almost distorting. I talked about that earlier, when you do that, it doesn’t give us a lot of headroom to be creative because it’s already slamming and pinning on the meters. Your mastering guy can make it loud for you, plenty loud. Audience Member So leave one or two dB of tolerance from the maximum? Tony Dawsey Or you could even leave more, leave a little bit more. Like I said, the mastering guy can make it crazy loud, if that’s what you desire. The other thing is, I know in this day and age, I know a lot of digital stuff is being used, and what I’ve found in the digital world that’s very close to the feel I like out of analog is I've had some 24-bit DATs or CDs that I’ve had before, and those sound pretty darn amazing, I’m pretty impressed with that. The difference between audio CD or computer data files, me personally, I use the same converter to play it back. There are some converters I use called DCS, most of the guys at Masterdisk have them and they’re very, very good-sounding. So whether you get an audio CD or CD files, we play them back with the same converter. So it really doesn’t matter, but if you had a choice between 16-bit and 24, I’d say do it 24-bit. It may cost you a little bit more for us to rent the machine to play it back or charge you a little extra but it’s worth it sound-wise. That’s my feeling. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Anybody else? Audience Member You said that it’s very important to produce music on good speakers so that the sound wouldn’t cheat you when you listen back on other speakers. So what set of speakers would you advise to use for low-budget producers? Tony Dawsey That’s another thing. If you get Mix magazine every month, there are hundreds and hundreds of speakers out here, all types of budgets. Personally, I have small Genelecs that are near me on the console that I like a lot. I can’t tell you the model exactly but I’ve had them for about five years, but they come with the subwoofer and their own amplifiers, those things are incredible. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Are they on a website? Tony Dawsey I’m sure they are. It’s the smaller ones. I also use some KRK monitors, the first generation seven series. I probably sold a couple hundred of those just myself. Unfortunately, when you have a good product out on the market, these different manufacturers tend to want to make them better and KRK I know has gone crazy over the years. They've have Formica on the side of them... They made K-Rok, a triangle, all of those, crazy stuff. I like the first generation ones, they’re called the 700 series, I think they’re phenomenal speakers. But the best way for you to judge your monitors is for you to play back material that you’re familiar with. Before you get into mixing and all, perhaps some old records or a CD that you’re very familiar with and you always liked the way it sounded. Play that back over the speakers and that’s the best way of testing and telling if they’re decent or not. The stuff you're familiar with. Doing a mix on something you’re not familiar with is not going to tell you what you need to know. We all have favorite records that we’ve loved over the years and I just say check your speakers out with those. I had a big system in my room that I’ve used for years. They were a Hartley sub woofer, an Altec in the middle and some customized tweeters up top. The system was very, very old and I wanted something new but I was very afraid to change them simply because this is how I make my living and this is what I’m known for, that type of speaker and the sound that I get out of that. Well, finally, this guy called Francis Manzelle came along with some speakers called the Griffin Monitors where it had an old-school ribbon tweeter and a big subwoofer and it was just an incredible-sounding speaker. The unfortunate part of that is they cost as much as a little car. But what he did was set them up in my room on a Friday and for three days in a row, I came in with a whole big bag of CDs and stuff that I was familiar with, records that I knew and liked–some I mastered and some I didn’t–and I played music back for three days. Just played it back and gave him some input as to what I liked and what I didn’t like and I ended up buying the speakers and I got rid of the old ones. Now, like I said, that was a big thing for me because I was used to that other system, I had used that system for probably 15 years or so. I was very, very familiar with it, very comfortable with it. But again I did want a new speaker system, and that’s what I did to make sure what I was buying suited me well. Just played back nearly 100 CDs, and no, I didn’t listen to every one of them but I would skip to certain cuts and I would listen to them and make sure that this is what I wanted and what I liked. Because, like I said, if your speakers are lying to you, there’s no way you can expect your mix to be done right, there’s no way. So that’s important, what you use to monitor, for sure. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Just keep in mind Tony’s going to go into the studio after the break and work on some of the stuff that you guys have done so you will have more opportunity to ask him questions. Audience Member You told us your normal day is about ten hours, 12 hours. So again I want to know is how can you hear that your ears are tired? What tells you that? Tony Dawsey I just know at four o’clock in the morning I’ve had enough. And I don’t want to be doing what I’m doing at that point, if it comes down to EQ'ing a record. Like I said, I really like to start my day, personally, 11 o’clock, 12 o’clock, I’ll start an album session or whatever. Now I could spend ten hours EQ'ing a record and that’s not a problem, eight to ten hours, sometimes a little bit more with a good day's rest and all of that. The last few hours of that day is sequencing the record and then making the copies. So even if I do tend to go to three or four o’ clock session in the morning, the last few of those hours are sequencing, it’s not equalization anymore. I mean, everybody’s different, you got to learn what your limits are, but definitely, if you get into a situation where you’re mixing until the wee hours of the morning, simply check your mix the next day and if you don’t find it’s perhaps too darn bright where your ears are like “woah,” then you’re probably okay. Audience Member So how important to you is a certain amount of sleep? It is important for me. Tony Dawsey I’m getting older now, I used to be able to be alright after five hours sleep, that was fine, I functioned okay. But I am getting older now and I find that I do need to sleep a little bit more. But we don’t live in a perfect world, so sometimes you have to do what you have to do and all, but there’s no way you function right off an hour or two of sleep. We’re human beings, that's what you gotta remember, we’re not machines. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I think everybody in this room understands that. Now just one last thing: Did you ever enforce any kind of rule to make sure you didn’t have to go beyond four in the morning? Tony Dawsey Ha, ha, ha! Yes, I did. Jeff “Chairman” Mao How did that turn out? Tony Dawsey There was a time where one year–I think it was 1998–I was working just too much and I knew because I was very, very cranky. It’s not like me to be cranky and to be snapping at people and everything else. I remember I was working on a record that was mixed by Timbaland and they were two hours late for the session, I’d already equalized the record, I was making the copies and they called up with the request of me to do something and I kind of snapped. Now, that wasn’t good because I probably lost a client. I haven’t worked with... Although I’ve done mixes for Timbaland, I haven’t worked with him since then. You know, when you start snapping and being cranky with people, you know you’re just overworked too much. In 1998 I had to tell people in the front office, look, I'm working too much. I remember at one stretch I was working until six in the morning three days in a row. I knew it probably wasn’t my best and I had to tell the front office, “Look, I need a day off. I have to get away from this because I’m starting to lose it.” After I snapped at Timbaland, I knew I was losing it and it’s not cool, it’s not cool. A lot of times in the music business, especially what I do, there’s deadlines they’re always behind. It's always "It has to be done now, has to be done now.” So there will be times when you’ve got to do what you got to do, but you know your body, you know how you function and you know when you're pushed over the edge and when to back up. It got to a point after that year, I was working late so much and unfortunately two, four hours, people would show up late, where I decided to impose a rule where, if I worked past midnight, my fee went up to $600/hour. Now yes, that’s a ridiculous amount of money, but I didn’t do it to make money, I did it to encourage people not to have me there that late. You know, to show up on time and get the job done. And some people don’t give a shit, you know? Nothing you can do about that; you just charge them at the rate and keep on going. So that’s what I did to try and combat it and in some cases it worked. People were like, “Oh no, we’re not going to be here after midnight,” and I was like: “Good, very good!” Jeff “Chairman” Mao Alright, Tony Dawsey. [applause]

Rick Essig
Rick Essig, co-owner of the Master Cutting Room, has been one of New York’s top mastering engineers for the past 20 years. As he told us at the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, Rick virtually lived at Record Plant, a studio that hosted people such as John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix, and his dedication paid off when he moved up to Master Cutting Room, and learned the art of mastering and lacquer cutting. Since then, he’s been behind hits like Yoko Ono’s “Walking On Thin Ice,” Loleatta Holloway’s “Love Sensation” and Dawn Penn’s “No No No.” He’s also remastered John Coltrane and Herbie Mann and cut endless vinyl including Amp Fiddler, Danny Krivit and Needs (Not Wants).
Hosted by Patrick Pulsinger A warm welcome to Mr. Rick Essig from New York, ladies and gentlemen. Rick Essig Thank you! Who here still likes to spin vinyl? Very good. I like to see that, that’s good. I am the last person that can screw up your record, that is true. Patrick Pulsinger So actually, when you do music you maybe end up with a record deal, maybe, and he actually could be the man who is in charge so that your music sounds good on the record. You did stuff for Radiohead, for Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, for Everything But the Girl. So the man knows how to get the stuff on to the radio and everywhere, that it sounds good. So maybe tell us a little bit about your job. People come with what and what can you do for the people in general? Rick Essig I’ve been doing this for close to 18 years. I enjoy cutting vinyl and I got into it when people started to say, “The death of vinyl is coming.” I’ve only cut more vinyl every year I’ve been doing it, so it’s a big lie. People love vinyl. I love cutting vinyl, it’s a great format. You really get a cool sound from vinyl that really doesn’t come across well in digital at this point yet. So it is still kind of one of those voodoo-craft things, that a lot of people really can’t do, mainly because of the machinery involved. It’s a big frickin’ lathe you got to cut these things on. The material itself is a very specialized type of paint. That’s like car paint on a piece of metal. That is basically what a lacquer master is. It’s a cool gig and dance music guys, DJs, I mean, they’ve been great. They’re the main source of business for me in my work, which is nice, because I have a nice following of DJs and underground subtype labels that really only do vinyl, which is nice to have. Patrick Pulsinger What would you say that actually when dance music, especially techno, in the early ’90s took over with all the independent labels, would you say that this saved the vinyl or extended it? Because major productions were not coming out on vinyl anymore from the beginning of the ’90s, people were switching to CDs, but the independent small labels, they would still do vinyl because they wanted to hand it out to the DJs. Rick Essig Oh yeah, a lot of house and underground stuff. Definitely. Patrick Pulsinger So you think that the independent labels kept it alive for much longer? Rick Essig Yeah, although the [major] labels always have always done 12"s, it’s kind of funny, a lot of them are just promos. But it’s amazing, a lot of singles are released like a jewel single, will be longer than a frickin’ album, they got so many goddamn mixes on it. Double vinyl, 70 to 90 minutes of remixes for one track, they put that stuff out there and the general public doesn’t see them. Patrick Pulsinger So regardless on what kind of stuff you bring out, like it might be a CD or, you said before a cassette, also mastering for cassettes you did, or vinyl – what would the people bring to you? You start up your equipment – what would you look at, what’s the format people would bring you? Like, finished music makes you go through pain or enjoyment? What’s it usually like to start with a project? Rick Essig It’s getting crazy now as there are so many different formats. People are bringing in mp3s, they’re bringing wavs, they’re bringing split stereo files, interweaved stereo files, mono files, sd2, sd1, it’s kind of insane. I’m always trying to help people to bring whatever master is closest to what they finished the mix as. Not to keep bouncing it around and converting and changing things. Because a generation loss is a generation loss. They say if you got it digitally, you’re not going to get a loss, but things can happen. I’ve gotten files where there was supposed to be a stereo file, but one of them is like slightly out of phase because it’s maybe two frames offset and the guy does not know how that happened and you have to go in and [fix it]. Patrick Pulsinger So you would usually not hear that if you just listened to it, but you would hear it and you would have to worry about it? Rick Essig Yeah, call the guy up and… Patrick Pulsinger So tell the people a little bit about what’s the perfect preparation before you can do your job and how you would prepare your master? You said you like cutting from tape. Rick Essig Yeah, I mean analog tape ideally is going to sound good, but in certain aspects I understand it’s not possible. Number one, it’s not cost-effective. Number two, if you are dealing with it digitally, you’re just doing samples and stuff, you don’t necessarily... I mean, a great record is a great record, when it actually sounds like it. You can have a great record of just 8-bit samples. It’s little about how bad those sound, but put together correctly it’s still a good record. You wouldn’t do an up-sampled 96k master of that, to high-res because it’s not really high-res. It’s a high-res copy of a low-res record. The simplest thing that you could come up with – again after you’re done with the mix, whether it be a CD master, a DAT – you just want to keep it as close to what you’ve done before you give it out. You know, any format, we take them all. Patrick Pulsinger You said you’ve been doing it for like 18 years, so you obviously started before this bedroom production era of everybody being able to have a sequencer with plugs and everything set. Would you see an increase in the quality of the material that was sent out to you, because the stuff is so around and you could get a compression plug-in here and things like this? Or was it better when it still was more down to the analog recording stuff? Rick Essig Yeah, I mean quality-wise, yeah. Definitely, in the early days when you had a dedicated engineer making a mix of a project, it was of generally better sound quality. Patrick Pulsinger So bedroom productions in general suck? Rick Essig No, I just think that people that get themselves set up aren’t necessarily familiar enough with the tools they are using and maybe not using them optimally. They’d be using too many presets, are not really digging around with the program itself to really see what it is doing and what it’s not doing, that type of thing. There is a whole step missing these days. A guy started out as a mixing engineer, but before that I had to watch these old guys do it for years. Patrick Pulsinger Tell us a little bit about that, how you came from the engineer kind of thing into the mastering thing. That’s important, because that’s the step that we mostly don’t even know about. Rick Essig It’s not there anymore, that’s a missing step these days. If you were lucky enough to get in the door of a good studio, usually you started out slopping toilets, taking out trash, getting coffee, whatever you could do. Cleaning up after the session, winding cords, just the lowest of the low bullshit. But that’s really how you got into it. First of all they find out if you are serious about it, because you’re there about 90 or 100 hours a week, basically you just live there. But that’s where you also get to see these guys do this stuff and you also get to see how signal path works, what a signal path is, what’s actually happening to the sounds from either the guitar or vocals all the way through to the final tape. There’s a lot of stuff going on and it’s a big juggling act to get a good sound on tape. I mean, that process, just learning how to do that, you can’t buy that kind of stuff. Because now they really have set up these mixing programs in such a way that you really can get something done... It may be a great record, but it may not sound close to how good it could sound, if you are really familiar with the stuff you are using in line. I mean, it’s so easy now to have these really pretty digital mixing tools that these guys put out for Steinberg and all that stuff that actually looks like a piece of analog gear. But what is it really doing? Patrick Pulsinger Let’s say you do the production at home, there is no other way you can do it, you know? You have to fight your way through plug-ins. Maybe some gear that you can get on the sly. How important is it to compare to stuff you want to sound alike? But how important is it actually to listen to your stuff on your speakers at home? Rick Essig Very important. A lot of times, new clients especially, say, “Here is my record, here is this Dr. Dre record. Make my record sound like this record.” Well sure, it’s not going to happen. Dre has the people around him that know how to put a record together. That’s why his record sounds like that. But if that really is your goal, and you have the system in your house, put the Dre record up. How does the Dre record sound on your system – and then try to make your mix sound as close to that as possible. You may have a crappy system at home, but the whole comparative thing is what you can really get your ears tuned into. If you have a specific sound in mind that you want to get and you may not have a sub, so you don’t know what’s on your subsonic level, you just crank in that low end and tell those little babies are flumping around. And be like, “That looks like enough low end.” But then, when you actually get it on a record, it’s like, “Ohhhh, whooowow way too much.” So, it’s really just again: Familiarize with what you have. I’ve heard the worst records in the world coming out of the Hit Factory booked out for $50,000 a day. It’s horrifying. Again, I’ve heard great records coming out from people’s basements. Patrick Pulsinger So again, it’s more... Rick Essig The individual. Patrick Pulsinger And it’s not only the gear that you have. You can go out and buy all the gear, but if you don’t have the experience… ? Rick Essig If you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s just a waste of money. Patrick Pulsinger So, people do it anyway at home, fiddle around with compression plug-ins, de-essing… Rick Essig L1 Ultramaximizer. Patrick Pulsinger Ultra-maximizing their stuff… Rick Essig Evil, evil tools. Patrick Pulsinger Does it make it harder actually for a mastering guy if people take too much life out of their stuff? What would you suggest? Rick Essig Never put two-track compression on a mix. Make it sound as good as you can and then let the other guy do it. Because that way, if there are really any problems that need to be fixed in the mix, you need something to be brought up or brought down. When you have the headroom to do that, it’s much easier and it sounds much better. It’s almost like people will be like, “Ey, I finally got it to be a square wave, now it rooooocks!” It’s farthest from the truth. Whenever they ask me, I say, “Just don’t put it through anything in the end.” Don’t worry about how loud it is, that’s the last thing you should be worrying about. Patrick Pulsinger But the loudness is to a lot of people is very important because the record might sound good. When you put it on the CD it sounds good, but you have to bring it up three or four notches so it would sound the same as a Mariah Carey record or whatever. Rick Essig We do that, but after we processed the tracks, so it’s my job to make it loud. Patrick Pulsinger So you would go from the dream thing, you would go down to the limitations of the format? Rick Essig You have to, yeah. I mean, the ultimate delivering is 16-bit, 44.1kHz CD master. Unless you go SACD (SuperAudioCD) or we even got that 1-bit thing, but then I will convert that format. Patrick Pulsinger Actually, you worry about the loudness afterwards. Rick Essig You know, when I process the track, EQ it, compress it, whatever I got to do with it, right before I dump it in the workstation to edit it up, I’ll put what it needs to put on it to punch up the volume. Patrick Pulsinger But what if the peaks stand out but you did compression before, do you make sure that it is the nice flat kind of like…? Rick Essig Basically what I do is like, again: VU meters, which, you know, a lot of people don’t use these things these days. But as far as a VU reading of a peak modulation on a record, it would have to be zero VU plus or minus whatever level you put on the record. So you can have a record, let’s say, plus five over what the peak of the record would be. So to transfer over to the CD thing is what, I say, basically my limit would be, I would add about eight db of gain until I get plus eight over zero for a CD, that’s basically as far as I push it. That’s the competitive line. A few people go over it, but, I mean, it’s just horrifying to listen to it. Patrick Pulsinger Because if you do it with software, the software would keep you with like a red line there, you know? Rick Essig Yeah, that’s the thing. The tools we have there are specifically designed just to do that. But again, I mean how many records are out there that you cannot sit through the whole thing because it does something to you? It’s just annoying to sit through 74 minutes of music because it’s like grinding your teeth. Audience Member Let’s say that we can’t afford giving our stuff to someone like you or paying you for that matter – no disrespect – so then would it be in our interest to use the L1 Ultramaximizer? Rick Essig Sure, you got to do what you got to do. If you’re going to deliver the record to the plant to make your own stuff, then yeah. But if you know you got to use somebody in between, don’t do it. Audience Member So do you have any suggestions about how people should proceed, who maybe just have the cracked wave plug-ins? Rick Essig See, it’s tough because I am working on an entire analog console. So I am dropping input levels to certain devices, so I’m not overloading things along the way and it’s like a little bit there, little bit there, little bit there, until the final thing is what it is. You may not have that luxury there, you’re just pumping it through the chain. Audience Member So you mean that you are going along with the EQ and dropping certain frequencies and increasing other ones? Rick Essig First you have the input level from the console, so if I get a mix from someone and it’s already screaming hot, I’m dropping the input level on the console by 10db, just to start out. And then I’m rebuilding it again from there to try and fix whatever problems there are going on and then at the very end of it, unfortunately if I have to re-add some gain to it. Patrick Pulsinger So, if the master I would send you is terribly loud because I am embarrassed of sending you a quiet master, you take it down anyway. Rick Essig Yeah, I have to. Patrick Pulsinger So do you go through the track? Would you subtract what you don’t have and let it stand out within what you want to have or would you add to it? Rick Essig It depends. There’s some things you want to cut, some things you might want to add. I am not one of the engineers that always has to be adding. Sometimes taking away is a better deal. A lot of times people have way too much screaming, like 14kHz, so I just roll that right off the bat. I’m not going to bring the bass up to try and fight with it. It’s that whole checks and balances thing. After so many years you build up kind of a card file of what things sound good and then you just reference that. I reference that in my head when I’m working. It goes like, “OK, this is this type of music. I think it seems to need this.” Patrick Pulsinger You were saying “the bass.” I mean, we were talking a lot about it in the studio about compression and stuff like this. Obviously, the hardest thing for most of the people is to get the bass right, like the bass is the hardest frequency. Rick Essig Yeah, it’s either fighting with the kick, or it’s fighting with the bottom end. Patrick Pulsinger So you talked about that you don’t even use a sub in the studio. You don’t believe in sub? Can you explain that to us? Rick Essig Well, I don’t, because in my studio I have giant speakers that have adequate low end. I’m not against it in an environment where you have absolutely none. I mean, you got to hear something. But I think people tend to fool themselves with the sub, or it’s not set up right. If you really want to get accurate, you have to really tune what you’re actually listening to to be – not necessarily flat – but as accurate as it can be for what you hear. Everybody hears different. Patrick Pulsinger A lot of people are afraid of that record in a club then, because they have actually a sub standing there, and it might sound like it’s screaming in the mid-range because they didn’t put enough sub in. But for mastering purposes you would try to create a mix that would work in the club as well as on a little kitchen radio? Rick Essig See, that’s kind of a myth too. Because as long as it is done right, it will sound good anywhere. You don’t really have to say this is going to be the radio mix because the radio guys beat the crap out of your record anyway. It’s pretty much dead once it hits the airwaves. Because they have to fit all that crap in that little bandwidth of airwaves. Plus, they want it to be screaming loud. If you try to do that with a mix, you will hear it will be super harsh. People think, “Well, I need to make it brighter, I gotta have less low-end for the radio.” That was maybe true in the ’40s, but not now. Patrick Pulsinger When you finished your track at home, you made it as good as possible on your Mackie mixer or wherever, I always go and I listen to it on different speakers, in the car and on different sizes of speakers as well. Rick Essig At that point it should relatively sound the same. Obviously there are going to be differences, but there shouldn’t be huge differences. If there is, then there are some issues in there. It’s not because the boomboxes is boomy, it’s because something in the mix is making the boombox boomy. Audience Member This is going to be a weird question, but basically, what you do is the same thing as maybe what Ron Murphy does? So you cut the records right there in the studio? Rick Essig Yeah, I have a lathe in my studio. Audience Member And all of your stuff is analog? Rick Essig Well, my console is, but I use a digital workstation as well. But I use that basically as a tape machine for editing purposes and for assembling a master for CD if need be. Or a lot of times now, people deliver records on either three different sources or out of sequence, so I have to dump it in and sequence it before I cut it. Participant And the best type of a format to give you would be a stereo file? Rick Essig If you’re going to use Pro Tools files, yeah. Keep ‘em linked once you separate them and they’re floating around somewhere. I mean, not just me but you know you may supposedly find a guy charging you 50 bucks per hour to get your CD done. Don’t leave anything to chance because you may end up with a CD that’s all f’d up. Because it’s real easy to slip those [stereo files]. I have to load the ST files directly onto my Sonic Solutions system and it doesn’t interpret it like a sound designer does. So I’m basically just now stuck with two single files left and two right that now I have got to align time-wise. So, if you got a guy that is not really hip on doing that right, you could have some problems. If you have an interleaved stereo file, they can’t screw it up. Patrick Pulsinger So, what’s the most common – let’s call it mistakes – that you were drawn into when people turn in mixes. If it’s coming from a big studio, from a major production studio or from somebody who did it at home, can you pin it down to the usual mistakes that people do? Not only like mechanical force of the medium, but also when people do their mix and there are vocals in it, there is a guitar in it and stuff like this, is there a usual mistake that people make? Putting up the vocals too high, or adding up too many highs? Rick Essig Again, I don’t know because people like different things. I have clients that I couldn’t listen to what they want me to do. It would drive me insane, but the client is the client and I am a service guy. Some guys want it super stupid bright, other guys like a lot of low end and they don’t like it so bright. It’s always a personal taste. Obviously if there are glaring mistakes I can say, “Dude, there is a problem here. We might be able to fix it, but, you know…” But some people just like a vocal way the hell out there. Patrick Pulsinger But you basically work off a stereo file. People would not come with eight files and you would do like…? Rick Essig I have done it but I make sure I make it cost-prohibitive. So they do not come too often. I don’t like doing that. I’ve had to do it, I did a compilation of Deee-Lite stuff with Dmitry [Brill, member of Deee-lite]. And Dmitry hadn’t finished mixing, so we actually rented gear and he was mixing this record during the mastering session. Patrick Pulsinger In your place? Rick Essig Yeah, which was just stupid money. I mean, I was like, “Uff, we got to do it.” Me, I guess I have ADD or something. I just can’t spend that much time on a fucking song. I work and, you know, that’s it, let’s do it, let’s move on. So to sit there, it’s just torture. Audience Member Can you describe a bit about the process of mastering? Because for me and for a lot of people, they don’t really know what’s the difference between engineering and mastering? Rick Essig First of all, it’s really just having hopefully somebody you trust as that last set of ears to listen to it and make objective changes on your record. Because you’re so close to your own record, it’s tough to really make informative decisions on what may not sound right. So I am kind of like that extra trusted set of ears to say, “Alright, you know what? We could probably fix it by doing a little bit of this and a little bit of that.” It’s kind of weird. Unless you’re actually putting vinyl out, it’s not a super necessary step yet. A lot of people think they need it, obviously. I think it helps, because they’re giving it over and it’s like now do what you think needs to be done to really make this thing shine. It’s that last bit of spit and polish. Audience Member Can you describe more specifically, like the Radiohead album, what did you do? What did they bring to you and what was the process that you did? Rick Essig Say a Lil’ Kim record comes in or a Jay-Z record. And it’s a 12", so you have three different remixers doing a remix of the same track, three different guys in three different places. So, initially you listen to all three and you say, “There has got to be a certain amount of continuity here.” Since these guys are not talking to each other, it’s probably not going to be that. So the first step is to say, “Alright, what do I need to do to bring these a little bit closer together in more of a flow type thing?” So one track may be ultra-maximized, one may not. One may have super stupid low end and one may have nothing. So you got to look at that and again, you kind of reference what you have in your head as for whatever I’m listening to, “This is what sounds the best.” And then you try and adjust that to come up to what that reference point is. That’s basically just EQs and compressors, just the basic stuff. De-essers. Patrick Pulsinger You do use compressors on the overall track? Rick Essig Yeah. Patrick Pulsinger Good ones, though? Rick Essig Yeah. Patrick Pulsinger So basically the chain would be, you go through a couple of EQs… ? Rick Essig I actually compress before EQ. If you do it afterwards, it will tend to get more pumping because now you compressed an EQed signal. I think it’s easier to compress a flat signal if it needs it. And then you’re dealing [with] number one. You may not add as much EQ because you’re hearing more of what’s missing in a track to begin with. That’s my preference. Some guys do it after, I do it before. I’ve done it after, but now I do it before. Maybe next year I’ll change. I don’t know. Audience Member Has there ever been a time, where, let’s say, hip-hop artists or any artists bring their music unmixed and say like, “Just master it”? Could you please share an experience of something you brought to life, you felt like, “Oh, it’s unmixed and I have to do something with it”? Rick Essig What do you mean by unmixed? I mean, it’s always going to be in a two-track form. Audience Member Yeah, two-track stereo, that’s what I mean. Rick Essig Oh yeah, all the time. A lot of my clients – that’s why I have them – because they are like, “Alright, do what you got to do. Do that thing you do.” Patrick Pulsinger They wouldn’t come with suggestions? Rick Essig Yeah, most of my guys, they don’t come for sessions anymore, they just mail it in. The deal with the mastering is, if you come in to a studio, you really don’t know even what you’re hearing. I know what I’m hearing because I’m in that room every day. Once the guys get used to what you’re doing, they would rather not show up because sitting on a couch for eight hours can get pretty tiring. You play the same SEGA golf game over and over, it gets old. It’s the same principle as with that 12" thing. They come in and basically the mix is all over the place, the tracks themselves. Audience Member What exactly does the equipment that you have do and how do you do it? Rick Essig I have a Maselec transfer console, which is a three-piece unit. One is analog inputs. All my inputs and outputs from my converters and my analog gear go in the back of that. The input from whatever source I’m coming from, whether it be tape or whatever is plugged into that goes through… The console is broken up in a bunch of different sections. An input section, you have an insert section, you have an output section, which has different filters. It has a width control, it has all the neat little gizmos in the analog thing. Then from there I have it going to a Maselec compressor, into a Sontec mastering EQ, into another Sontec split left/right parametric EQ. Then it goes into another de-esser, an analog peak limiter, which I pretty much only use for cutting the vinyl. I have used it on some CDs, though. Then it goes back into the converters, to convert it to digital and then whatever nonsense I got to put on it to make it loud, it goes in there. I have an Ultramaximizer L2. Everybody’s got an L2. Patrick Pulsinger OK, we got something from our man P-Nice here. This record is out, right? Audience Member Yes, it’s out for free. Patrick Pulsinger So you did some mastering on it? Audience Member Yes, I did. This is something I did a lot of mixing on and then at the very end I did EQ to bring up the highs a little bit and L2 or L1. Rick Essig Ultramaximizer! Audience Member Right, exactly. Since I knew I wasn’t going to give it to someone to master it, this is just a demo, I did not have to have them crank up the system. (music: Unknown) Rick Essig A big problem with that, too, is those goddamn multi-disc players. That really is what fucked everybody up because you could just put five in or ten in and then you really start going, “Oh, now I got to turn the thing up.” But when you put them in one at a time, you are already up there [at your stereo system]. Audience Member Like you were saying 45s and 33s, you have to turn up anyways… Rick Essig Yup, nobody wants to get up off the couch. (music: Unknown) It’s kind of boofy. That technical term “boofy.” (music continues) Yeah, a lot of times subtracting works a lot better than adding to cover up stuff. That’s what I would do with that. The piano, it’s like that 600 to 1000Hertz range… Participant So you think the piano is a little bit too loud? Rick Essig It’s not loud, it’s something in the low range of the keys. It’s a low-mids thing. They need to be, I think, more tinkly. You know what I mean?

Ritu
Rewind back to ’60s London. Two respectable, hard-working Indian immigrants have given birth to a dimpled baby Ritu. As we find out during this lecture from the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, her parents have a lot to be proud of. Just as the bhangra music of Punjab broke through barriers of language, caste and creed to become loved all over Pakistan and India, thanks to Ritu and her colleagues, Asian music has been fusing with other forms of modern dance and hip-hop to make waves around the world.
Hosted by HEINZ REICH Ritu, imagine you are sitting in a plane, you can’t sleep for some reason, the in-flight movie is boring like always, and close to you is one of our students. So now imagine you have to tell him or her your life – where would you start and how would you do it? RITU OK, well, I’d start by being born. I was born in London in the 1960s, spent pretty much all my life there, apart from a little brief trip out to America as a child and a brief period where we lived in Wales. But I mainly grew up in East London in the ‘60s, ‘70s, which was quite a racist area at that time. In fact, it still is to some degree. And jumping forth to my musical career [laughs] – after being born, I became a DJ. When I was at school, I was very interested in music. I was part of the school choir, the school orchestra, the school marching band, I learned to play trumpet. I was also asked then to play tuba because I was told I had big lips [laughter]. And I taught myself to play guitar and piano. I didn’t get my first record player until I was about 11. I had to really beg my dad for a record player. Finally I got this record player and the first track I bought was a track called “Darling” by David Cassidy [laughs in embarrassment]. And so began my musical origins. Growing up, I really wanted to be an artist, a painter, and I went to art school. I went to Chelsea School of Art when I was 18. And it was while I was a student that I started to go clubbing and somehow felt that I could do better than some of the DJs I was seeing in various clubs that I was in. And that’s how my DJ career began. One of the clubs I was going to, they got rid of all the DJs suddenly and I said, “Hey, can I have a go?” And they said, “Alright.” And I ended up being resident at that club for the next six years. And somehow, I think my painting, the creativity that went with my painting, my art side, somehow got transferred over into DJing. So it started off as a hobby, but 17 years on, it’s a profession. There’s a potted history. HEINZ REICH Fine, the flight might go on for another 11 hours, but we can still switch topics. There is a bus-load of serious things that, of course, I want to talk to you about, but I think before we come to the what and the why, it’s always kind of interesting for the people to know who is sitting here. So there is an interesting detail, that you said your best feature is the dimple on your bottom. Can you explain this? RITU Erm, no [laughs]. I always wanted dimples on my face, and unfortunately, my younger brother, who’s nine years younger than me, got them and I didn’t. But I think it was some years later that someone pointed out that I actually had a dimple on one of my buttocks. So it just kind of ended up in the wrong place, but it has no relevance or no bearing, no connection with the music side of what I do [laughter]. HEINZ REICH But it can be found when you are Googling on the internet under the name of DJ Ritu. RITU There is all kind of weird things under Google under the name of DJ Ritu. None of it has been put up by me, so… HEINZ REICH You also said that your biggest inspirations are your mom and dad. Now, that’s really interesting because, I mean, if my father had been my biggest inspiration, I would have become a fisherman or filming documentaries about springboks in the jungle, but no music. Did your parents inspire you musically or do you mean that spiritually? RITU I think my parents have inspired me more spiritually, and also I guess the work ethic is very, very strong with my parents. And what I am very conscious of is, I am second generation Asian, but they are obviously first generation. They came from India to the UK in the late 1950s, early ‘60s. And it was very, very, very, very difficult for them, you know? Being from a country that was formerly a colony, many people in India and some of the other colonies regarded the UK as being the place to get the best education. Everything that was English was the best thing. And, of course, all these people went over there to work and then found, you know, signs upon boarding houses saying, “No coloreds, no dogs, no Irish, no this, no that.” One year my father went to Trafalgar Square for the New Year’s Eve celebrations as a young man, he must’ve been around 20, 25, something like that, and he was punched in the face just for being Indian. So I suppose in that sense my parents have been very inspirational, because what I have seen them do is I’ve seen them struggle. I have seen them work very hard and not complain. I suppose a lot of my strength, actually, comes from them. To this day they are remarkably liberal, they are very encouraging about what I do. They weren’t at first, I hasten to add. I was kind of regarded as the black sheep of the Indian community that I grew up in in the UK, because I didn’t want to be a doctor or a lawyer or an accountant. But once I started presenting for the BBC, that’s when my parents then felt that this was something they could identify with. It had status. And that’s why since then, they have been much more, sort of, “OK, we understand what you do now and it’s alright.” HEINZ REICH So I suppose that this possibility of doing the radio show for BBC was one of the big milestones in your career. Your first show has this very interesting title called “Bhangra in Beds.” How did you come to this title? Is it played in the morning, when everybody is still sleeping? RITU OK, out of the radio shows that I have done and still do, none of them have been titled by me. The show I do currently is for the national BBC Asian Network, it’s called [grimacing] “The Mix,” which is not a title I would have chosen. I have also presented two series on Asian music for the BBC World Service and they were titled “Bhangra Beat” and “Bhangra In Beds,” which was the first radio show I started doing, for BBC Three Counties Radio. At that time it was called BBC Radio Bedfordshire, covering the county of Bedfordshire in the UK. And the short version of Bedfordshire was Beds. So there was a program called “Breakfast in Beds” and blah-di-blah, so my program came to be called “Bhangra in Beds.” HEINZ REICH OK, no sexual connotation or whatever? RITU None whatsoever. HEINZ REICH OK, no mattress mambo. That was ‘92, what was the next big step in your career? RITU I turned 28 and literally a week later, my six-year residency, which I mentioned before, suddenly went. I looked in the magazine and found that some other people were DJing in my residency the following week [laughs in disbelief]. And within the next year, all my DJ residencies went. So I kind of thought, “Well, maybe I am not supposed to DJ anymore.” I actually really thought that, and I struggled to get work for quite a few months. You know, I had the odd gig here and the odd gig there, but nothing regular. And it was because of that I moved into radio. I just sent a demo tape off to the BBC. It was a terrible demo tape, absolutely terrible. But they liked my voice and they said, “Yeah, great, come in and we will have you,” sort of thing. And it was actually through doing the radio program that I started to meet a lot of people. The radio program led me to meet up with a guy called Mitts, he was part of the first ever Sikh rap outfit. It was three Sikh guys, you know with turbans and everything, and they caused quite a stir in the UK in the early '90s because they were just so unusual to look at. Mitts, who was one of them, was setting up a club in conjunction with two of his other student friends. And this club turned out to be the first ever weekly Asian club in the UK – possibly even the world, actually, not even only the UK. It was called Bombay Jungle. It opened up in The Wag, which was a very well-known, mainstream sort of club. This was every Tuesday night, and suddenly Shaftesbury Avenue in central London, the whole face of it completely changed because suddenly there were all these Asians. And we used to pack 700 kids into this club, there’d be piles of young people outside who couldn’t get in because it was just too full. The media really got hold of it. I mean, we had film crews in from Japan, or Canada, or India, just everywhere. So it caused a major, major buzz, this club, and I was fortunate enough to be one of the resident DJs at it. So that was quite a turning point for me, and that led me to the formation of Outcaste Records. Bombay Jungle opened in 1993, Outcaste we founded in 1994. I was being sent records, free records as you do, from various PR companies. One of the PR companies was a PR company called Heavyweight Media, and they were sending me records by people like Apache Indian, the Ragga Twins and so on. And the guy that was sending me the records, we ended up talking a lot on the phone. And we talked about how we felt that the music industry was basically blocked for Asian talent to come forward. We felt that there were no openings for Asian people in the music industry at all. If you are Asian, you could go and join one of the bhangra labels and do bhangra, but what if you don’t want to do that? The only other alternative was Nation Records, which had been set up around 1989, 1990, and that was much more about a kind of global chaos fusion thing. So we really felt that there was something missing. It was a big gap in the market, a big gap for Asian artists to go to. We also talked about how we felt that for people of African or Caribbean descent, that certain moves had been made forward in terms of how cool it was to be black on the street. At this time, I was also working as a youth worker, I was managing a youth center in North London. And what I was seeing there was black kids, white kids, Greek kids, Asian kids, and all the kids wanted to be black. Like, they were wearing hip-hop kind of clothing, talking in a kind of urban street, black street language. They were listening to black street music and so on. And I said to Shabs at Heavyweight Media, “Wouldn’t it be great if it was cool to be down with the brown?” Meaning that, mainly through music, maybe we could change something about how Asians would be perceived in the UK in terms of the coolness factor. Because at that point, we were definitely not cool. We were the people that were running the corner shops. We were the people that made curry, we were the doctors. We weren’t regarded as musical, we weren’t regarded as sporty. Nobody wanted to be like us. And so that is how we started with Outcaste. It was with a specific view to making a lot of social and political changes and not just music that was equally British and Eastern. HEINZ REICH And haven’t you been surprised yourself by the immediate success of Outcaste Recordings? RITU It’s a surprise now. I think we didn’t really feel the fruits of our labors until ‘96, maybe ‘97, when the Asian underground scene started to be a scene and started to be an industry and started to be something that the mainstream press was writing about and talking about. And we started to see a lot of excitement, particularly in Europe. In fact, Europe was far more receptive and far more open and far more keen and eager to be hearing this music and hearing the artists, far more than the UK was. In the UK, we have to remember, the UK has a special relationship [miming quote marks] with the Indian subcontinent, which again goes back to being the former colonies. And so we were constantly battling with this thing of “It’s not cool to be Asian, and the music ain’t cool either,” right? So when I look at what is happening now, I can see, really, the fruits of our labors and of many other people around us that also worked towards the same goals at that time. If somebody had told me that this year I would be going around the world and playing Bollywood in places like Belgrade, in Stockholm, in Cairo, in Istanbul, I would have laughed. Two years ago, I would have laughed. I mean, if somebody said to me, “Yeah, you will be going around the world, playing the Asian underground,” I wouldn’t have laughed, because that has been normal for me for the last eight, nine years. And in fact another reason why we set up Outcaste, one of our other things that was in our mission statement, was that we hoped that by making music that was very palatable for western people, you know, drum and bass that might have a tabla loop stuck in it or a sitar somewhere, that this would be the stepping stone, the first step on the ladder for non-Asians to access Asian music. We hoped that what would then happen is that non-Asians would then access more traditional forms of music after that. And that didn’t happen in the ‘90s, but it seems to be happening now. HEINZ REICH You have found a very interesting way of broadening the spectrum of the work of a DJ with your project Sister India by adding visual elements, dancers, rappers. Could you briefly introduce to us how that happened? RITU The band that I had before Sister India was called The Asian Equation and that was created by accident. Basically, I was DJing in Brussels and a promoter that was there came over to me and said, “Listen, I love what you do and every year I hold an annual live music, six-week thing in Berlin” – it’s actually Heimatklänge – “and I would really like you to come there and perform there, but DJs are very boring to look at.” I said, “Thank you.” And so he basically gave me a budget and said, “Go and do something with this money.” So what I decided to do is I called upon various musician friends of mine and I thought, “Well, OK, they don’t look boring. Even if I look boring, they don’t.” So I tried to devise a way of working with these guys – it was all guys, actually, I was pretty much the only woman there – and we went off to Berlin and did these five shows. So Asian Equation just suddenly took on a life of its own. It just kind of snowballed. I think maybe about two years later, 1998, around then, I started to get serious about it and I realized that I really was enjoying what I was doing with it, because now I wasn’t the only person, this solitary person DJing, I was collaborating with other people. There was a creative exchange going on. And I found that it actually brought out my performance aspect. Normally when I’ve been DJing, I’m in a little booth and I’ve got my headphones on [stands up], and I’m like this, the foot is tapping away like this [taps her foot and puts her head to the side as if listening to headphones]. With Asian Equation I found out that I can suddenly come out of myself a little bit more. So it brought out the performer in me to some degree as well. Along the way I kept meeting quite interesting Asian women who were musicians. There was a woman called Sudha, who you will see on the DVD in a minute, who was actually a Latin percussionist and she works with Faithless. And she was also resident at clubs like The Haçienda in Manchester, Cream in Liverpool, Ministry of Sound in London. And there was another woman called Jotie. She was an Indian woman, she was playing violin for people like Joan Armatrading, Ryuichi Sakamoto – excuse my pronunciation – Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra. She was working with a lot of top people. Anyway, so these women were kind of dotted around, they were in the background, they were like session musicians, or just background people in various bands and clubs. And I kept thinking, “What would it be like to take an all-female, all-Asian team? What would it be like if Asian Equation was not all guys, but was all women? How would that be, what kind of energy would that create?” And anyway, we applied for a grant and we got it. And that’s how we created Sister India, as an all-Asian female equivalent of The Asian Equation. (music: Sister India – “Out Of Place”) HEINZ REICH This is apparently a really well-done blend of fusion of Indian elements and very up-to-date rhythms and parts of, let’s say, western club culture. This attitude is quite opposed to that of those elderly gentlemen yesterday who were very, very conservative, clinging to the old production values of the ‘60s and the ‘70s as the only valid formula. How come you and your partners are so open minded? RITU [Teasing] I think it’s probably the dimple on the bottom, that probably has a lot to do with it. I mean if you have a dimple on your bottom, you have to be really open-minded afterward. I see myself as someone who is here to entertain. And I am a firm believer that people come to my gigs or come to my clubs, that they are paying money and that my job is to entertain them. And that, I think, fits straight away hand in hand with having an open approach, because you have to be saying, “Well, let me come to you, what can I do for you?” You are saying that, aren’t you? You are aiming to please, you are aiming to provide something or provide something that’s being asked for. HEINZ REICH If you come back to the political implications of music and your role as an ambassador between two cultures, I suppose that if you want this effect that people say, “Hey, it’s cool to be down with the Asians,” you can’t be hardcore, playing traditional Asian music because then the western guys will never get it. And on the other hand, if you would be just a regular drum & bass DJ, you would do nothing for the Asian community. So, this was probably the best formula. RITU Well, this is one of the formulas. I mean, the Sister India formula is fusion-y. It is what some kind of people would term as Asian underground, though we, in fact, like to describe ourselves as a club music-based band. We are basically a club on stage with a whole visual show and whatever. But with the clubs that I run…? OK, let’s take Kuch Kuch, for example, which was the first Bollywood club in London – we opened three years ago in 2000. And there I am playing pretty hardcore traditional Asian music from the Indian film industry, Bollywood, and also bhangra, which is pretty traditional. It is definitely not what you just heard on the DVD at all. Quite different. But there, what I’ll do there is I will mix it up with R&B, I will mix it up with house. But I think what we’re seeing now is a coming-of-age of British Asians. We’re seeing a movement that can’t be stopped any longer and it is filtering out and out and out and becoming more and more mainstream. I mean, I will pretty much bet that most of you or a lot of you are from different countries, but I would imagine that almost all of you have heard of Panjabi MC. HEINZ REICH Who has heard of Panjabi MC? RITU [Looks around] OK, so most people. Because the track “Mundian To Bach Ke” by him, which went to number #5 in the British charts in January this year, had already charted in Germany, went to number #2 in Germany before Christmas. It was playing in Turkey when I was there in September last year. So it’s kind of going into the Top 5 or Top 10 in almost every country in the world. And that is just an amazing, absolutely amazing thing. HEINZ REICH Do you also have a typical example of bhangra here? RITU I've got three typical examples of bhangra here, and there is probably a fourth type that I didn’t bring with me, which is a shame. I am going to give you three types. If we start with the first, that would be a very traditional form of bhangra, much more how it would be done in India itself, as opposed to in its fusion world or in its diasporic world in the UK or the States or Canada or wherever. OK, so here we go. (music: Gurdas Maan – “Apna Punjab Hove”) That one is actual a very nationalistic piece as well. It’s one of those ones, if you DJ in an Asian club you will get a lot of Punjabis coming over and saying, “Play that track! Can you play that track for me, ‘Apna Punjab’?” The part of India that is Punjab, northern India, it is in Pakistan as well. Punjab was actually divided by the partition of Pakistan and India. So the region of Punjab falls in both. And bhangra music is Punjabi. It’s not Gujarati, it’s not Sri Lankan, it’s Punjabi, and the lyrics are sung in the Punjabi language. They are sung in Punjabi. And nine times out of ten, in fact, 99 times of 100, it will be sung by a guy. There’s not women. There are very few women in that music, in that scene. HEINZ REICH Is Panjabi MC also a second generation Punjabi? RITU Yeah, he is and his real name is Raj [laughs]. Yeah, and he is from Birmingham. Yes, he is Punjabi. HEINZ REICH What are the typical bhangra dance moves then? RITU Bhangra music originates, as we say, from the Punjab, it is a folk music. And really it was largely created around the spring, for the harvest of vegetables and corn and what have you. And the main drum that is used in bhangra music is the big double-sided drum that is put around the neck and beaten with sticks. And it is called the dhol, OK? So you will hear that over and over again in bhangra music. And the dhol is very much about [imitating] ‘tchaka-tchaka-tchaka-tchak’. Come and dance! Come and dance! It is really loud, it is brash, a very brash sort of drum. (music: B21 – Unknown) You can hear it is British produced because there is a b-line for starters. Because on the first one we heard, which was Indian produced, a bassline is not that important, you know? Quite often it will almost be missing and quite often you have to turn up the bass on your graphic equalizer just to get something there at the bottom end, apart from the bass of the drums. Whereas the British-produced stuff, it will always have a bassline. You can hear, obviously, the beats are metronomed or drum-machined or whatever. It feels British, you know what I mean? It is not Indian-produced. You can hear it. And here is something that is very, very British. What is going on in the moment is a very big move towards urban bhangra at the moment in the UK. And that takes two forms: it tends to be either garage or it will tend to be R&B. On the garage side, you tend to get again a very strong bassline. You tend to have a rap, which will be done in English or Patois or something of that kind. And then the singing vocal will be in Punjabi. (music: Unknown) So how can you pigeonhole bhangra? You have heard three very different things there. And if you add Panjabi MC into that as well, that is four different things. So there is a lot going on with the music, and I think the only thing that really unifies it is the fact that, as I say, there will be some lyrical content which is sung in Punjabi. And that’s about the only common ingredient now going on. The interesting thing with a track like this, for example, is, I run DJ workshops in various places, and some of the schools we are working in East London recently, it has been quite phenomenal. You know what I said earlier about being a youth worker and seeing all the kids wanting to be black? And the schools in East London at the moment, the Asian kids bring music like this in and all the other kids are listening to this and they’re bringing stuff in like this too. So suddenly people are wanting to be brown. Does it make sense? And that’s a really big difference that I’m seeing at the moment. For me, to be seeing white kids listening to this in school with their Asian friends is like… But you can hear why, because apart from the fact that they wouldn’t be able to understand the Punjabi lyric, everything else is familiar to them. You know, the tempo, the beat, the rhythm, everything is familiar. HEINZ REICH You already mentioned Dr. Dre and Missy Elliott. We have witnessed that big hip-hop artists have been sampling elements of Asian underground stuff or bhangra. So would you be happy about this? Would you say this is another achievement, even black [people] now would say, "Hey, it’s cool to be down with the Asians”? Or is it just that they are in need of a little bit of exotic topping on their production? RITU The Asian music industry is very split on this question at the moment. I think we are all very excited to suddenly see some progress at last with Asian music becoming more mainstream. But everyone is terrified that it is going to be fad, a trend, it’s going to come and go as quickly as it arrived. My personal belief is that it I don’t think that it will come and go as quickly as it arrived. I think it will be around to stay for quite a while. The reason being is that, if you came to Bombay Jungle back in 1993, you would have heard us playing bhangra, but you would have heard us playing ragga, you would have heard us playing jungle, you would have heard us playing swing. We would have heard all the music styles playing in there. But if you went to a black music kind of club, you wouldn’t have heard any Asian music being played whatsoever. So, what’s been going on in the Asian music scene for years in the UK, is we have been having this one-way conversation with black music and we’re having a one-way conversation with black culture. And it has never been the other way. It has never been a dialogue, it has never been a two-way conversation. And now, there is a two-way conversation going on, so we had Missy Elliott’s “Get Ur Freak On”, Dr. Dre’s “Truth Hurts/Addictive”, which actually was a bit naughty because he sampled, I think it was Lata Mangeshkar, but he didn’t get permission from the Indian record company. I think it was the EMI/India. And he just thought he could get away with taking this Asian lady’s voice and not telling anybody. And EMI/India knew that he was about to release this track, and they sent him letters and phoned him or phoned his production company and said, “Look. All we’re saying is, you need to clear this sample, you need to pay us for it and then you can release your track.” And they just ignored these letters and just went ahead, released the track anyway. So when it’s done like that, with no respect whatsoever for the artist and for the record company, then that I’m not happy about at all, and I think a lot of people weren’t very happy about that. And ultimately, if Dr. Dre or Missy Elliott or any of these other people are putting Asian music out there, it sends it out to a wider audience than any Asian artist could take it to. If an Asian artist had produced “Get Ur Freak On,” it would not have gotten into charts. That wouldn’t have happened. So Missy Elliott could take it one step further and to new audiences as well. So now there is a dialogue. The one-way conversation has stopped, there is a dialogue going on and that’s got to mean a longer life for Asian music outside of the underground.

Title: Sal Principato (Liquid Liquid)
Date: 2015-04-22

Sal Principato (Liquid Liquid)
The year is 1979, and five young guys are jamming in a Hispanic neighborhood in downtown Manhattan. The vocalist of this group is Salvatore Principato. By day, he works in a toy store with Kim Gordon. By night, he’s dropping his vocal inflections onto the rhythms of his group, who go by the name Liquid Liquid. As we found out at the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, their own brand of “body music” began to be heard alongside bands such as Suicide and ESG while also finding a way into the pioneering sets of DJs like Afrika Bambaataa and Larry Levan. Ultimately, one of their songs became the instantly recognizable sample for Grandmaster Melle Mel & The Furious 5’s “White Lines,” forever putting Liquid Liquid’s name in the hip-hop history books.
Hosted by Brendan M Gillen So anyway, they had their band replay that. And actually, you might want to know that that band that replayed it, if you listen to it it’s definitely a crappier version as far as the production and whatnot. They lifted the tones up and I think they made them a little bit more radio. Sal Principato Yeah it’s more accessible, their version, you know. I think it lacks a certain bottom. Brendan M Gillen Yes, we should actually go back to the point of how did this song cross over to this crowd? You know, this is pretty unique. It’s like a band coming from... So let’s rewind to before there was a Liquid Liquid. Sal Principato Basically, we come out of the punk rock scene of the ‘70s. And an aesthetic of the punk rock thing was, whatever else you were doing, whether you were a chef, whether you were a visual artist, whether you were an athlete, you seemed to form a band. You seemed to get into music. Music seemed to be the thing to express yourself through. It was very much a do-it-yourself aesthetic. You know, you weren’t following any template. You were just, like... Actually, you would pick up an instrument and start playing. And once you learned that instrument, you would put it down and pick up another one because really knowing how to play your instrument really well was not looked at as a good thing because it stifled creativity and innovation. So we come out of that aesthetic, you know. And then as we hit the ’80s come on and a whole new thing started coming into play. Brendan M Gillen So the first Liquid Liquid record is actually, what? Liquid Attack or something? Sal Principato No, no, it’s Liquid Liquid. I mean, we had a few manifestations self-produced like 7" 45s and stuff like that. When we were kind of a punk band, we called ourselves Liquid Idiot and played CBGB’s back in the day and all of that. But then we started getting the groove on, we started getting the big beat because the big beat was in the air. There was all this kind of innovation going on uptown, downtown. And that’s the other point too. I mean, there was a convergence of the hip-hop scene and a downtown dance-rock scene. Back then everything seemed fresher and newer. I don’t know, I guess people were just... I don’t know if they were any more open, but there was this feeling that it was time to see what we can learn from each other. But it wasn’t like this big conscious thing, people were just doing their thing. We were on the street. I mean, remember too, this was before the video age and that changed everything. Because that illustrated how things were supposed to be. Before then you would go and see a live show to see how things were supposed to look, you know, and how they’re supposed to feel. So there was a whole different texture and it allowed you to be a little more quirky. People were a little more tolerant of your quirkiness. Mistakes weren’t bad. Mistakes were possibly a lot of people’s only spontaneous moments. So they were looked upon as interesting. Brendan M Gillen It’s also important to think about it as the time before hip-hop was really on record. The time of the Liquid Liquid records is just the dawn of hip-hop coming onto record. You know, it had been maybe in parks, in nightclubs. But it actually hadn’t been solidified yet. It was much more of an open thing. So what was like the first hip-hop stuff that you saw? Sal Principato Well the first hip-hop stuff I heard was Kurtis Blow’s “The Breaks.” We were really into that jam. Brendan M Gillen Yeah! Sal Principato But the real thing that I loved so much, which really colored my perception of Grandmaster Flash eventually using our tracks, there was this jam they had called “Super Rappin No. 2.” It’s played live, the Sugarhill House Band played that, there were no samples in it. This was pre-sampling too. Another thing, this is all pre-sampling, this is pre-video. This is ancient history, really. But, they played this wicked, wicked groove. You had the five of them rapping over that. [starts to rap] “...introducing the crew, you got to see to believe, we are one, two, three, four, five MCs.” [laughs] It was just... it was it, you know, so we were feeling the warmth. There was a warmth to the music too. In 1982 we tried to do this show. It was... what’s his name? He produced some of the Beastie Boys and Johnny Cash? Brendan M Gillen Oh, Rick Rubin. Sal Principato Ah, Rick Rubin, alright. Rick Rubin was a student at the NYU at the time. And he comes to our manager. We had this underground label called 99 Records on MacDougal Street in the village. And we had this guy, Ed Bahlman, he was a producer and everything like that, and he had a record shop. He was the hip underground guy at that time. And Rick Rubin goes to Ed, he says, “I want to put on a show, I want to do something with your acts.” And so we came up with this concept, uptown meets downtown, we had the Treacherous Three, “Rock the body body, rock the body body.” They had that jam at the time. And we had this punk hardcore band at this time and we had Liquid Liquid, which was like the groove music. The link, like the connection between hardcore punk and hip-hop that was going on. And we rented this hotel in midtown Manhattan, the Diplomat Hotel. Man, I was so psyched about this. It didn’t seem like no one ever did this. No one even thought of this stuff that hip-hop and rock could get together and do something. Well, it was a beautiful show, but it wasn’t as well attended as we wanted it to be and at that time I got really discouraged. It was like, “What the f-,” you know? But it was the start of something. It was like the opening salvo of that cross connection. But ultimately it wasn’t us who initiated it. Like I said, it was amazing, it was the DJs. It was Afrika Bambaataa, you know, Afrika Islam, Larry Levan and a host of others. Some I know, some I don’t know. But our jam started appearing in master mixes and WBLS. And also our manager, too, going up to the offices of BLS net. That was the days when payola was still in effect and stuff. But things started happening, it started appearing in very unlikely places. Brendan M Gillen But let’s talk about coming right out of the punk scene. What was it like when you first heard [Public Image Ltd album] Second Edition? Sal Principato Yeah, you know, it’s interesting. Well, first see, that thing was in the air. It was not only that Second Edition, it was [PiL’s] Flowers of Romance too. Let me first refer to Flowers of Romance because, at the time Liquid Liquid had songs that were just drums. You know, drums, or drums and bells, drums and sticks. I always kind of looked at it that we were just playing sticks and stones, basically. So anyway, we had this very minimalist percussive thing. And then, I heard Public Image, doing like “Flowers” over that song. And then Adam Ant, all these people using the burundi beat from Africa and stuff like that. And it was like, “Damn!” Right now we are with an underground New York label. These people had access. Same thing with David Byrne, he was doing all this experimentation. And it was all good. But it was like, “How come these guys could get it out there so fast? We’ve been working on this for three, four years and no one’s heard our shit and these guys probably thought about it last week and they were already out there with it.” And it was like, “Agh!” [laughs] Brendan M Gillen Yeah, so the first Liquid Liquid record, it’s uh... Sal Principato 1980, that was. And that was before Second Edition. Brendan M Gillen Really? Sal Principato Yes, it was. Audience Member You were saying that you consider yourselves a rock band. And then your tracks started to turn up on other mixes and you had support from the breakers and stuff. Did you pen any songs after that for that scene or become influenced and start changing your stuff for that? Sal Principato No, no, no. That’s against the rules, you know? You just do what you do from your heart. And when you are doing “heart” music [points to his heart], you can’t be... Well, let me put it this way. The inspiration for a song or for any piece of art should solely come from within you, for you, or just speaking to someone you love. But, when you go into the production stage of it, then you have to target your audience. That’s when you think of, you know, “Who is it that is gonna possibly care about this and how should I present it to them?” But the original spark of inspiration, your groove or your melody or your catchy vocal line, it’s just got to be for you or that one you love. There are no other considerations and anything else is just commercialism, which is corrupt in a certain respect, in an artistic sense. I don’t know, everybody is trying to make a living. If you are just trying to put out product, fine, you could do it the way you want. But if you are trying to make art, it’s got to come from here [points to his heart]. Brendan M Gillen Let’s check out some of the stuff that was... (music: Liquid Liquid – “Bellhead”) Brendan M Gillen What kind of percussion were you guys using? This is a group of four people? Sal Principato Yeah, that was four guys making that noise. We were, in that song, it was a home made agogo bell. [singing] “Ding ding dong da ding ding dong.” There was an alarm bell, like an alarm bell on a stand being twacked with a stick. And then there was Dennis playing a marimba, as you heard, like the “dancing skeleton” sound and then there was just a trap drum. So that’s an acoustic song. It got some club play back in the day. And back in the day, just like kind of now, there was electronic sequencing which was just starting to come into fashion. And there was this kind of electro sound and stuff. So you would hear all these keyboard synthesizers and sequencers and stuff. And then in the distance you’d hear, [singing] “Bing bing bing, bing bing, boom.” And you’d hear our acoustic song being played in a club. And I’d be amazed, but people just started dancing to it, you know? (music: Liquid Liquid – unknown) Brendan M Gillen On to the second record. Oh yeah, there are some pretty linear examples. Sal Principato People not digesting their influences and spitting them out, you know. And I feel that at least when we were influenced by something, we thoroughly digested it before we put it out there. So you could say, “OK, they are pounding on drums, you know, African music, whatever.” But that’s not an African rhythm. Brendan M Gillen No, I hear it actually mostly in the bassline, I think of it kind of like juju at that time. Sal Principato Really? No, totally un-self-conscious. Brendan M Gillen Just makes me want to jump up. Sal Principato Yeah, maybe we were listening to Sunny Adé’s “Ja Funmi.” [sings] “Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah Funmi.” Brendan M Gillen You were one of the first acts on 99 Records. This label came out of a record store? Sal Principato Yeah, like I said, Ed Bahlman, he had a record store. And at that time even his record store was a little bit revolutionary because at the time you couldn’t go into a major record store and listen to what you were buying. You were just buying it and bringing it home and see if you liked it or if you heard it before. And he had a thing where he would play records for the people, for the asking. And so in that time it was revolutionary or at least progressive, not revolutionary, progressive. Let’s put it that way. So his first release was Glenn Branca and Glenn Branca wrote guitar symphonies. He would have 14 guitarists doing these symphonies. And it was very intense music. And I don’t know why Ed started doing that, but that was his first release. Then there was the Bush Tetras, which was another downtown dance rock beat band, and then ESG, and then us. And then he formed an alliance, with some of the people in England like On-U Records, Adrian Sherwood, the Congos. He did a 12" with the Congos, the reggae group. Brendan M Gillen Really? Sal Principato Yeah, yeah! Brendan M Gillen But yeah, this ESG record gets produced by Martin Hannett giving them the sound that, I think, takes this really interesting young group of girls from the South Bronx. Sal Principato Yeah, they were three sisters, literally sisters from the South Bronx. The drummer, you couldn’t see her over her drumkit. I mean, they were like 16-years old, between 16 and 19-years old. They have this little squeaky sound and stuff, it was sweet. It was really sweet. Brendan M Gillen They told me that their mum bought them instruments to keep them off the streets in the South Bronx to give them something else to do and they just would listen to James Brown records and try to come up with a cooler rhythm than James Brown. That was like their motivation, to top James Brown. Sal Principato Yeah, we used to call it “bubblegum funk.” We did a show at Knitting Factory in March of this year and it just went really well. It was really awesome and since then it was all these offers including electronic music festivals. Brendan M Gillen And thanks to a crazy lady named Tinku, who had the energy to pull it together, she got Liquid Liquid and ESG at the right time for Detroit to see this. It was actually probably the most legendary moment of the Movement Festival this year. You had producers that wouldn’t ever leave their home to go to a club or anything, standing around in the crowd, actually losing it, seeing four guys standing on stage, all hitting different rhythm instruments. Or when you had ESG, who in their current incarnation, had their younger cousins in the group? Sal Principato Now their children are playing in the group. They’re going to dress in spandex and shit. [both laughing] Brendan M Gillen It’s a family affair. Have you seen anything that captures the feel of that time? Sal Principato Alright. I’ve heard things. It’s interesting enough; there is this whole crop of bands coming up now in New York, like the Rapture and stuff, which take the whole catalog and the whole vocabulary that we used in the early ’80s and they’ve updated it and they’ve embraced it hook, line and sinker. Like, you’ll hear Pat Place from the Contortions guitar, and you’ll hear Liquid Liquid percussion and you’ll hear ESG congas and stuff. But, you know, they evoke that period, they really do. Just to hear that because it’s just people doin’ it [smiles], you know, just doin’ it. That’s what reminds me of it. Audience Member I’ve been listening a bit to this era lately and I just wonder how James Chance & the Contortions kind of fit in? You haven’t talked much about them. Sal Principato He talked about no-wave. That was definitely with them and DNA, they were part of the no wave movement. When I came to New York, I arrived in New York in 1979 from California. James Chance at Max’s Kansas City was the first show I ever saw. And he was walking on the tables, because they have big long tables, family style tables at Max’s Kansas City. And you could walk right off the stage onto the tables. And James Chance walks off the stage and he was just kicking off everybody’s beer [stands up imitating him], “Off with those things,” you know? It was very wild, you know? But his thing was based on, he was like the punk James Brown. He was trying to do a pretty self-conscious version of James Brown. Brendan M Gillen James White & the Blacks! Sal Principato Yeah, James White & the Blacks. To a certain extent we were a self-contained unit. We weren’t trying to associate ourselves with anybody. And it’s only in retrospect, I think, that it all comes together. At the time it was just everybody doing their thing. And you didn’t really look at yourself as all that related to anybody else. You appreciated what they were doing. But you said, “Well, that’s Arto Lindsay [guitarist of DNA] doing that and Fab 5 Freddy doing that and we are doing this.” But when you look back on the whole thing, you see a connection. There is a compilation that came out; Soul Jazz Records put out a compilation called New York Noise, which has a pretty broad range of all [those styles]. I have it here. Brendan M Gillen I would like to go from the times of these early 99 Records and go a little bit further than that to after the hip-hop thing was stronger in New York. I guess you guys had... it seems, this record here is really focused, the Optimo EP. It’s like a very focused record. There is one song, if you have never heard Liquid Liquid before, that one you just have to hear. (music: Liquid Liquid – “Optimo”) That record right there is why I will always cite Liquid Liquid as a major influence. Sal Principato And just to keep reminding you: That was basically an acoustic song with an electric bass. That was the only electronic thing that you had to plug in in that whole song. [smiles] Brendan M Gillen It has so much energy and how did you guys, for instance, put together that kind of structure? Sal Principato Totally organic. I mean, probably just sitting around smoking one afternoon and we got the groove going. And then we recorded it and the next day tried to imitate it. This led to that and this led to the other thing. It’s just organic grooves, you mnow. Brendan M Gillen And what about the lyrics, the voice? It seems to me that the voice isn’t trying to tell you a story. It’s just trying to evoke imagery, quick emotions. Sal Principato Well, you know the thing, what I consider a great vocalist is to be is not someone who can sing in 12 octaves. But someone, where you hear their voice, it opens up a vista. Just the texture of their voice gives you a whole view of life. But not by what they are saying, but just how it feels. And the other thing is, that even back 20 years ago, it seems life is one big billboard or one big commercial. Like everybody is trying to dictate your reality, give you this complete package of how to feel, think, look at yourself, look at others. And so I thought literal meaning should be put in the background and just the pure texture of the voice should be brought out. And not to mention, at the time I was very impressed by dub reggae. And not necessarily on that song, but on certain other songs I was just trying to do dub snippets. I listened to lots of reggae music at the time and I liked the dub versions more than I liked the regular songs. I felt the vocals in the dub versions said more to me [points to his heart] than [sings] “Ladi da da, da da da.” I would rather hear, “La la la la la. Da da da da da.” [imitating an echo with his voice]

Sebastian Niessen
Sebastian Niessen was the synthesizer engineer for Kraftwerk, playing an integral part in crafting the sounds that became an influence on the hip-hop and dance music you hear today. After Kraftwerk, Sebastian continued to work as a sound engineer, moving to New York City in 1984, where he worked on soundtracks for Raising Arizona and Barton Fink. As he explains during this lecture at the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, he continues to design instruments and modify synthesizers and has helped many of today’s most forward-thinking artists, from Robert Hood and Peter Kruder to Aphex Twin, Richie Hawtin, Basic Channel and the Modernist.
Hosted by Patrick Pulsinger Our guest today is Sebastian Niessen from Germany, from Munich more specific. He is a constructor of electronic instruments, as well as a musician. He played with a couple of people performing his own equipment and other equipment that he modified on various records and releases. And he also goes on tour with his stuff to back up some artists when they do live acts - the synths and sequencers and stuff. He selected a couple of tunes from the history of electronic equipment, and he picked out a couple of people who were, I think, most influential to his work as well. Sebastian Niessen Whenever somebody gets involved in electronic music the first and major difference to play an acoustic instrument is that you have the opportunity of choosing your equipment more than just saying: “OK, I want the Steinway piano rather than a Bösendorfer or I want a Gibson guitar rather than a Fender.” Which are about the choices that you have, if you play a guitar or if you play a piano. That’s pretty much all you can do about your instruments. In electronic music it’s totally different. It doesn’t mean that everybody has to build instruments, certainly not, but it means that everybody that is somewhat serious about electronic music, any aspect of electronic music, even say, related to DJing, it’s true, but certainly it’s true related to producing, making tracks, making electronic music. Part of your training and your growing in into being an electronic musician is choosing what instruments you use because I am sure everybody knows, there is zillions of tools around by now. Software, hardware, all kinds of strange, more or less strange things and you can’t use them all. Life is too short for that. By now there is there is probably, I don’t know how many programs and how many different pieces of hardware, it’s into the thousands, maybe tens of thousands, different pieces of equipment or software that you could possibly use trying to express yourself in electronic music. Obviously, you can’t use them all. So you have to make some choices what you use. And in order to make these choices you have to know a little about the possibilities, the limitations... the strengths and the weaknesses of these various instruments. As I said, you can’t know them all, which is why it is always interesting to understand an abstract concept, before actually getting into learning a program or learning a machine. Most of you people have started being interested in electronic music at a time where a lot of possibilities already existed and were commonplace or are commonplace. If you look back at the history of electronic music, people that started with electronic music a little earlier, by force had to design or at least have somebody design it for them their own equipment, because simply there was no equipment. There was no stores that you could go to and say: “Hey, I need the hippest sampler and the hardest drum machine and I am in business,” that didn’t exist. So all pioneers of electronic music designed their own instruments, simply out of necessity. There just wasn’t anything around. And before I get into detail about my own work, I would like to talk about two pioneers of electronic music, which are particularly influential to electronic music in general and my own work in particular. One of them is an American guy named Raymond Scott, you might have heard about. The other one is a German guy named Oskar Sala. Let’s start out with a short track by Raymond Scott, recorded in 1930s, purely acoustical. (music: Raymond Scott Quintette – “Microphone Music”) Sebastian Niessen There is no cuts, no splicing, nothing. It was played like this from beginning to end and the guy who brought this quintet to life, Raymond Scott, started out as a swing bandleader and very early on he tried some techniques that there was no equipment available to do them, but he nevertheless tried to do them and his techniques were very modern. They were very remixer-like and very much an attitude that a DJ today would have. What he did was, he would record any rehearsal of his band onto a record—they didn’t have tape recorders at the time,they would cut a record for every rehearsal—he would take all these records back home and sit there with like five gramophone record players and do needle-dropping. Just listening to various parts of various tracks that he rehearsed with the band and since there was no technical way of splicing, he would write down, “OK, I like bar one to seventeen from that track, I liked bar five to nine from that track,” and then go back to the next rehearsal and have his band play that. And that’s how a track like this came about. He was pretty successful with this quintet and he made quite a lot of money in the ’30s before the war. And actually, one of the ways that he made a lot of money was that Walt Disney licensed some of his tracks to be used as soundtracks for cartoons. Making this money allowed him to pursue his other major interest beside from music, which were electronics. And he started to try and build, and design, and construct instruments that would allow him to go beyond the possibilities of an acoustic swing quintet, basically. And so most of the war years and afterwards he spent no longer rehearsing with this quintet or playing swing music, but just sitting at home soldering. The reason why I picked him as one of the sort of influential designers, constructors, inventors of electronic music, is because he was very fascinated with sequencing early on. He was the first one to actually think about sequencing in another way than, say, a player piano is a sequencer. What Raymond Scott was trying to do was really to build machines that allowed him to compose music beyond the capabilities of human players and beyond the capabilities of normal acoustic music. And he actually started building a machine, which was basically a sequencer built out of relays, electromechanical switches. It took him about 20 years or so, and it turned into a wall of racks that was literally about 15 meters (45 feet) long. Two-meter high, 19-inch racks, about 15 meters long. “The Wall of Sound” is what they called it at those times and... Patrick Pulsinger So, he actually did a lot of stuff for IBM at that time and also stuff like spark plugs, I think even like, a medicine for... Sebastian Niessen ...cough medicine. Patrick Pulsinger Cough medicine, stuff like this. Everything that is related to science or chemistry or physics. People would get him to actually underlay their commercials with electronic music and we can play one, which I really love. It is for spark plugs, for cars and listen to the sound that he chose to make in order to visualize the spark plug, you know, what a spark does in a car and it’s a spark plug commercial. I think it is from around 1960. Sebastian Niessen Probably somewhere late ’50s. Patrick Pulsinger Late ’50s, early ’60s and it’s a Autolite spark plug commercial. (music: Raymond Scott & the Manhattan Research – “Autolite: Spark Plugs”) Patrick Pulsinger So he used this equipment, actually, to make the sound of a spark plug, actually doing a spark like tzzz, tzzz you heard the sound so... At that time, I mean, you could not just like go to anyone say: “Yeah, can you make me a sound of a spark plug?” I mean, you had to find those people and, actually, he was probably the only one in America at that time, who was actually capable of producing an electronic sound at the time. Sebastian Niessen And that was probably the first example where you can hear that he was not only interested in creating electronic sounds, but he was also, as I said, interested in sequencing. It may sound a little stupid to call this bipibip bipibip of a spark plug sound a sequence, but that’s in fact what it is. And he tried to somewhat automate the process of creating electronic music by means of what we today call sequencers, basically. And that is sort of one of the very first examples where he would actually use this. And I would like to play you another one. Of course, there is a lot of talking going on upfront. Don’t listen to the voiceover so much but listen to what is in the background. It’s an IBM commercial also from probably about 1960, ’61, something like that. (music: Raymond Scott & the Manhattan Research – “IBM MT/ST: The Paperwork Explosion”) Sebastian Niessen Check out the sequence in the background. I think we all would agree, that if we had just the music without the voiceover, any one of you would make a really cool dance remix just out of the loops that you heard in the background, right? And, as I said, it’s a commercial. It wasn’t intended for any club use or anything. It was made for something completely different, but some of the things that we consider very hip, very modern, whatever, have been around for a while. And even the aesthetics have been around for a while, yeah. His particular interest was to really program music, in a sense that all of us do today on a computer. Because there were no computers around... He was looking for machines that would allow him to compose music that couldn’t be composed before. He wasn’t interested in using synthesizers to, or... it wasn’t even called synthesizer at the time, but let’s use the term anyway. He wasn’t looking for machines that would imitate something or that would sound like a violin. He was trying to make sounds and to make music that couldn’t be done before. And, as I said in the beginning, the only way he could do that was to get into electronics, to get the soldering iron and to really develop, and design, and build his own stuff. I would quickly like to change over to the other pioneer that I wanted to introduce to you, which is a German guy called Oskar Sala. He is also born around the same time as Raymond Scott, early 20th century. Raymond Scott was born 1908, I think Sala, 1907... I am not sure. And his approach was a little bit different. He had been a music student in Berlin in the ’30s and he played the piano and studied composition, classical composition, with a classic composer or modern classic composer that some of you might know about, who is called Hindemith. A German-Jewish composer who later emigrated to the United States for obvious reasons. And around this bunch of people there was also a physics professor from Berlin University called Trautwein. This is what these guys had built for themselves in the 1930s and it’s the exact opposite of what Raymond Scott was trying to do. Raymond Scott was trying to do, as I said, to pre-program, to automate music. Meanwhile Oskar Sala was interested in creating an electronic instrument that should be played physically, just as you did a lot of bodywork involved in playing a guitar or playing a piano or anything like that. So, he definitely is up a different alley than Raymond Scott. And he was never interested in pre-programming in any sequencers or anything like that. He was interested in finding or building or designing an instrument that was as expressive... (video: Oskar Sala playing the trautonium) Patrick Pulsinger I think we have a second movie... Sebastian Niessen ...Where where he plays a sort of modernized version of this instrument, which he had built for himself in the ’60s. And basically, it’s the same technical concept... (video: Oskar Sala - Unknown) Sebastian Niessen It’s just a wire spanning across a metal rod. And depending on the position that he hits, he can control the pitch. That’s fairly simple, and since then there’s been Bob Moog and lots of other people building controllers that we know as ribbon controllers, which allow you to do that. One of their advantages and disadvantages at the same time is you have to learn to play them. You have to learn like on a fretless bass or on a violin you have to learn to hit the right notes, which isn’t so easy. But once you do that, you can do things that you can’t do on a normal keyboard. You can play vibrato by just moving around. You can play glissandos by just sliding up and down on the thing, which you can’t do on a regular keyboard. Also, you can play—some of you may have enough musical training to hear it—the stuff that we just heard was just intoned. It wasn’t equal-tempered. That's a big difference... That’s why some of the intervals sounded a little strange to our ear today because we are so used to listening to equal-tempered music. Because all electronic keyboards that you can buy today basically are equal-tempered. He started, as I said, in the ’30s, to play on this kind of instrument and it did take him years and probably decades even, to master this instrument. Because not only can you control the pitch very subtly and musically, but you can also control the volume very subtly and musically, by... You may have seen that the rod that he pushes the wire against moves downwards. How can I say it... It’s probably one of the strangest designs or mechanisms that I have ever seen in music. Patrick Pulsinger Did you try it out, did you play yourself? Sebastian Niessen Yeah, yeah, of course, but you look like a fool. (sitting in the audience) There are some Swedish folk instruments where there is basically a string and you are actually playing on the string and it seems that you can kind of... Sebastian Niessen But you plucking the string or...? Erlend Øye: Yeah, you are plucking the string. I mean, of course you can also hit it harder. And like this really old grand piano-like instruments, from the, what you call it... spinet or whatever it is? Is it like this, or what’s the difference between this and that? Sebastian Niessen No, the string itself doesn’t create any sound. Erlend Øye OK. Sebastian Niessen It’s just used to control some electronic circuitry and control the pitch of the oscillators in that electronic circuitry. Erlend Øye Would it be like playing on a spinet? Is it basically the same thing happens like if you do it like, if you press it hard, there is more sound, if you press...? Sebastian Niessen Right. But that comes from this mechanism I was just mentioning that translated the pressure into some voltage that could control the volume. Erlend Øye OK. Sebastian Niessen So, in this machine not only there is no fixed frequencies, no keys, but also there is no envelopes or anything like that. So all the ways that the sound is shaped volume-wise like how it attacks, how it fades out, is all played by him. Played by the amount of pressure that he puts on this mechanism. So you really need a lot of just, rehearsal training. You have to spend years on the thing. And he did get sort of a little bit more recognition for his work only in the last few years of his life. And people would approach him and say, “Gee, it sounds so great what you are doing. Can’t you teach me, or how can I learn this and how can I get into this?” And he would say, “Well, I tell you how to built one of these instruments.” Because he considered for any electronic musician you had to have some engineering capabilities. That was definitely his intention. He said, “Well, you have to know how to work a soldering iron and know a few things about electronics if you want to be a electronic composer.” And which I am not sure, it’s not necessarily today anymore. But people would then start to sort of look at his instrument and try to figure out what he was doing. And they would quickly recognize that most of the fascination that goes out from this music is just because of the physical capabilities that this guy has developed all over 20, 30, 40 years of hacking around on this string and on this strange instrument. And so today where everybody is into instant gratification, meaning that you want to get results and you want them fast, once people found out how difficult it is and how long it would take to learn it, they said, “OK, well I’ll pass. I think I’ll go and buy a regular Roland or whatever.” Patrick Pulsinger But he was actually taking this stuff to concert halls and he would perform live with this, like a piano player would perform on a stage. He was actually doing his own compositions playing on his own instrument and he would fill like... Sebastian Niessen ...big concert halls. Patrick Pulsinger Big concert halls at that time, like in the ’60s? Sebastian Niessen Well, actually he filled concert halls already during the dark times, during the Third Reich. Since he wasn’t Jewish, he didn’t have to emigrate and he managed to continue his musical work through all the Nazi time and which is a little strange also, because it is not necessarily the kind of music that they were into. And it might well have happened that they sort of put some pressure on him to play something more German. But he managed to continue to work with this instrument throughout the war and after the war. But the fact that he ended up being the only one playing this instrument comes mostly from the fact that it is so hard to learn and it takes so much time, not just to understand the circuitry and to understand why this and that will happen, but to actually manage to play it in a musical way. He did was the sound effects for Hitchcock’s The Birds. All the sounds in the background are also produced on the exact same machine that we just saw and that we heard in the other examples. (video: Alfred Hitchcock - The Birds) Now comes the fun part. We are in the early ’60s now and other people are starting to develop instruments. Bob Moog, who was here two weeks ago, started designing some stuff. And Oskar Sala was brave enough, I would almost say, to ignore all equipment that came afterwards. From what I know, he never for a minute thought about getting a Moog or sort of keeping up with technology. And I think, personally, when I look back at all the work that he did in his life, I think that was one of the main reasons why he did develop such a mastership on this one instrument... is because he concentrated on it. And he didn’t waste time on reading manuals and buying new equipment, going to the store, bringing back some boxes that would take you a few months to find out that they weren’t what you were looking for. So he was ignoring completely all technical development that came, that started on a broader basis in the early ’60s. And I think it shows quite some character, because today a lot of people, when they get into electronic music, they sort of start to look around, “What is he using, what is he using?” And, “OK, I like the music he does, so I have to buy the equipment that he uses. And I like his music so I try to get some of his equipment.” He had found his one instrument and just like a piano player, if he likes being a piano player, won’t think about buying a guitar, there is no need for it. And that’s pretty much what his approach was. And he, I think, developed some skills that are unique on this instrument and he was capable of producing music that nobody else in the world could ever produce. And I think today with all the generic tools and toys and gadgets that we have at our disposal, if any one of you wants to be successful and happy being an electronic musician, being an electronic composer for the major part of his life, you have to develop something that is specific to you. You have to develop a style, of course, and you also have to develop a certain type of mastery of your equipment that you will never develop if you just constantly keep buying the latest stuff. The instruments that you pick and the instruments that you use will have a major influence on the music that you make. And depending on what production environment you choose to have, whether it’s just one dinky little Casio keyboard or just software or whether you inherited $2 million and you went out and bought it all, it doesn’t matter. No matter what you use, it will influence your style. So, if you want to develop a unique style, something that is unique about your music, you have to have a unique setup. It doesn’t mean that it is unique in a sense that you built it and there is no second of it in the world. But it means that... Usually today, we don’t use just one instrument, we use a whole lot of boxes and the combination of these boxes and the way that you use these boxes has to, at some point, become unique. Otherwise you’ll just be one of these “Me-too” people for the rest of your life. So it’s tempting in the beginning to just go out and do copies of the software that your friends have and start working with it. You can do that, but you should do this in order to find the few tools, whether it’s software or hardware that are appealing to you, for whatever reason. These reasons don’t have to be rational. I mean, I for instance, like certain synthesizers because the way they look, I like certain synthesizers because the way they feel, because the way the knobs feel when you touch them and dislike others for the same reasons... they look shitty or they don’t feel good. Which are not necessarily musical reasons and I would say, why would the look of an instrument matter once you have a finished track and you don’t see the instruments anymore? But making music is something irrational. And that’s a big problem with computers. Computers are rational. And computers always force you to at least be rational every ten seconds or every twenty seconds because you have to think about in what menu you will find certain options. And I think that making music and making electronic music as well is a non-rational thing. And it should stay that way. Good, if you want to be a real musician in the sense of the word, making music is something irrational. There is no rational reasons. You can’t eat it, it doesn’t keep you warm, but obviously there is a need for it. But obviously, there is a need for listening to music and I suppose that most of you people are here because you feel a need of making music. The engineer looks at a certain piece of equipment and says, “OK, it’s done this and that way. And then there is these and those problems and you can do it cheaper or you can do it better.” And the businessman says, “OK, we can sell so and so many thousands of them.” That’s not what you should be concerned about when you make music, electronic music. You should be concerned about finding tools that allow you to become intuitive and it’s very difficult to become intuitive on a computer. I've seen people do it. I am not saying that computers are the wrong way. What I am saying is that if you only use computers, the tendency will be that your music will not be very emotional or very intuitive, because as I said, you have constantly to switch back into the rational mode in order to find the right menu and submenu and this and that. Audience Member But if you are composing well, it’s a totally different story because... Sebastian Niessen No, I wouldn’t say it’s a totally different story, because in classical music there may be enough well-trained people that are capable of imagining, saying a string quartet playing some score without actually hearing them. At least, if you have a good training as a classical composer, you can anticipate what it will sound like. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, in electronic music it is not the case. Even if you know a lot about synthesizers and equipment, it’s very hard to anticipate what a sound will be like until you program it or until you tweak the knobs and listen to it. So to me making electronic music is always some sort of conversation, some sort of dialogue between the machinery and you. And to me, good and interesting equipment for electronic music is equipment that talks to you. And by talking to you I mean, that it does things that are unexpected.

Seiji
Seiji, known to his mother as Paul Dolby, is well-known for his contributions to West London’s Bugz In The Attic posse. However, before broken beat or bruk appeared in the search engines of head-nodders worldwide, Seiji was already beat making, experimenting with US style garage and proper old school drum & bass. From the age of 17 he decided to expand his repertoire of instruments, moving from cello to the world of synthesized segues and clunky MIDI clocks. The broken beat sound came about from getting together, smoking and jamming. But, as he told us during the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, instead of being catalogued with a fleeting genre-definition or area code, he’d rather be known for “simply heavy music.”
Hosted by Tony Nwachukwu I’m here with a young man by the name of Paul Seiji. Seiji Hi, Tony Nwachukwu, hi everybody. Tony Nwachukwu How did you get into music? Seiji I’ve been into music since I was about seven when I started playing the cello. Tony Nwachukwu So, you’re classically trained? Seiji Yeah, for about ten years. I started playing cello, I went to school playing the cello, and that was my life until I was about 17 years old. While I was a teenager, I got interested in other sorts of music obviously, apart from classical. By that time I got interested in making music because I just got bored playing the classical repertoire and never creating anything. That’s when I started getting interested in making music and started fiddling about on bits of equipment, borrowed some equipment and just started making beats on crappy old MIDI sequencers and really terrible old Yamaha synths with their tinny sounds, and just started from there. Tony Nwachukwu What were your first forays into music-making? Seiji Pretty much it was house, what I tried to make at the time. US-style house, which I was into. Garage. I did a couple of tracks, which didn’t come out, they weren’t good enough. And then I eventually did one, called “Deeper” – [smiles] just a very original lyric. But my first proper release was under the name Disorient, that was for Orin Walters’ then-label Mousetrap. About the same time, I had met G-Force through a mutual friend and he was hooked up with the Reinforced guys. He had already done one production for the Enforcers picture discs and was producing drum & bass, and I got interested in drum & bass around the same time and started to do some as well. Tony Nwachukwu Was it a conscious decision from making drum & bass records for Reinforced to doing what you’re doing now? Seiji No, not at all. It was an accident really that my name became associated with drum & bass because, like I say, I was also very much into my US house and my vocal house. I was still trying to make that at the same time I was doing the records for Reinforced. I just think they didn’t stand out as much as my drum & bass records did because my drum & bass records were so weird that they stood out. The house things, I suppose, ended up eventually sticking all those various influences from drum & bass and house and everything together and ending up with what I’ve got now. It wasn’t any sort of conscious decision to move away from drum & bass, it was just a natural thing. And I think once the music started changing, I lost my interest in it. What got me into drum & bass in the first place was the complex beats. Breakbeat science, you know? I blame “Pulp Fiction” [by producer Alex Reece] for being the tune that made everyone decide it was suddenly OK to just have a fast hip-hop beat and nothing else. Whereas before that, there was always innovation in the beats and in the rhythms and just the sounds and the programming. Tony Nwachukwu Do you still listen to drum & bass? Seiji Yeah, I mean, I listen to it if I hear it. Obviously, there’s still some great tracks that’s been made out there. So, if I hear them, I appreciate those. And sometimes I like listening to drum & bass from the period that I loved it from, the period from ’94 through to ’97. Tony Nwachukwu First of all, what is Bugz in the Attic? Seiji OK, Bugz in the Attic is a collective of producers. Really, we’re mainly producers, as there’s only one serious musician, and that’s Kaidi [Tatham]. Bugz pretty much evolved from when I met Orin. I had put my first record out with him, on his house label and we just started working together and jamming around at his house. I think it was always his intention to build a collective – it was Orin who drove the whole thing, he is the daddy of Bugz. He collected people around him that he got on with well and were making good music, as far as he’s concerned. It really evolved completely organically, just him inviting people over. You know, Cliff [Scott] bringing his SP-1200 around and Khaidi coming around with a Moog and started to jam over the top. It was just friends smoking and jamming... happy days. Tony Nwachukwu How many of you are there in Bugz in the Attic? Seiji Now there’s nine of us. It’s a bit of a funny thing when people say, “How many of you are there?” because it’s gone up and down. Originally there was six and we always talked about there being the “six original members,” but now we don’t bother saying that. It’s always been this organic thing, so we might be ten next year. Tony Nwachukwu I know you produce records independently of Bugz. When do you decide – when you do a Bugz production – who does what? Seiji It’s quite an interesting question because there is no set way of doing things, which constantly amazes me as well, that we managed going on like this when there is no real method to the way that we do things as Bugz in the Attic. But I think it’s just accidental that we can all work together and we’ve always managed to find a consensus or a compromise that everyone’s happy with. I think it’s just down to the personalities and the fact that we all get along really well as friends as well. So, when it’s a Bugz production, it’s like a free-for-all. If it’s a remix, for instance, the parts will get handed out to everybody. Everybody will jam at home on it or in the studio, come up with ideas and play each other our ideas and say, “That’s rubbish, that’s good.” Like I said, we always tend to reach a consensus. Tony Nwachukwu What would you say has been the most difficult production you’ve had to do as a production team? Seiji I think it was probably the Da Lata remix of “Golden” that we did, because that was the one we did straight after the remix of 4Hero’s “Hold It Down.” “Hold It Down” was such an immediate success that we suddenly felt this pressure to come up with something that would top it. I don’t know if we did but that was that really. I think since then, we sort of realized that it’s stupid to feel that pressure anyway. We should just carry on being creative and just not worry about what people are expecting of you from a marketing point of view or something like that. It just comes back to music and vibing off what you got there. Tony Nwachukwu What are we about to hear? Seiji We’re about to hear a remix I’ve just done of a Scandinavian hip-hop thing, called Sensational. This is what I just finished. (music: Sensational - unknown / Seiji remix) Seiji I think there are a few different reasons that this criticism gets leveled. But I think, if people would see the dancing that goes down at Co-Op, for instance, it is quite obvious that it is danceable music. There is a heavy vibe at that club, when there’s lots of people dancing and lots of great dancers really getting down. I think the majority of people might not be open to thinking about it as dance music. It is complicated rhythmically, but it also sounds electronic. That’s two things that aren’t really that common in dance music. Whereas for instance, I always say about our music is that the rhythms in it are nothing new. Rhythmically, everything’s already been done anyway over history. The rhythms you’re hearing in broken beat are African or Latin, they’ve all been done before, they just sound different. Even just funk. Listening to funk records from the ‘70s, you will hear a lot of the same rhythms that we’re using. But because it’s in a different context, people don’t even pay attention to the fact that they’re hearing [human-beatboxes the drums of “Loose Lips”]. Because there’s a funk guitar going away behind it and a vocal and the drums are in the mix, so you don’t even register that you’re listening to a beat that is not as straight with a “two” and “four” snare. If it is a slightly more organic sound, people might relax more and feel the music rather than analyzing where the snare and kicks are and things like that. The one thing I find, when I’ve been to places and played the music to people that really have no education about electronic music or dance music or modern youth culture or anything like that, and they’re literally just feeling the same music that they’re hearing and not analyzing in any way, then I find I get a much better response. For instance, when I went to Puerto Rico and the people there don’t really read the music press or they haven’t been educated into “this is hip-hop, this is R&B, this is house,” and they haven’t all these categories stuck in their heads already. They’d hear it and for them it is all techno music, you know? So, they’re just hearing it, they’re feeling it and they’re dancing. Tony Nwachukwu Did you make some music while you were there? Seiji Yeah, I made a few tunes actually, but only one of them has come out so far. And that’s a record called “Vasilando.” All I really did was record a traditional plena and put a house beat underneath it. I felt a bit uncomfortable about it at the time, but I think the response to the record was good. Tony Nwachukwu Why were you uncomfortable? Seiji I was just a little uncomfortable with it because I was doing something that I thought wasn’t really me, because I was supposed to be constantly pushing boundaries and all these kind of things. But actually, I was just making a fun, danceable record. Tony Nwachukwu Are you maybe going to continue to record over there? Seiji Actually, it’s quite interesting what’s happening over there at the moment. Orin Walters, the Afronaught is out there at the moment and he’s developing further the links that we got with the Candela crew over there, which is a bar and a sort of festival. There’s now a music studio there, so we’re starting to work with some more original music, rather than just rehashing traditional music. I’ve got a little taste of one of the things that Orin has done recently on his last trip there. (music: The Afronaught – “Golpe Tuyo Calinda”) Income is a funny one because, like I was saying before, getting stuck in doing a lot of remixes is definitely what happened to me. Because, trying to make a living off music, you are constantly hustling. And remix work is the easiest way to get short-term cash. But I don’t think it’s the best. I think it’s something you’ve really got to keep a handle on because it can affect your creativity. The same thing with DJing as well. I mean, I don’t consider myself a DJ. I didn’t get into this because of DJing. I did mix records in my bedroom when I was 16 or 17, like I said, I was buying lots of garage records, listening to Benji Candelario on Choice FM. Listening to him mixing in key and holding mixes for three minutes and that sort of thing. I was into it, but I never really started properly, until I had the name from production, then I started to get gigs. It was actually Dego from 4Hero who first made me start DJing. At the time I wasn’t DJing and he was saying, “Right, you’re come with me to Japan to DJ,” on his next tour, and took me out there. Tony Nwachukwu So let me get this right. Apart from DJing in your bedroom when you were 17, your next DJ gig was DJing with Dego in Japan? Seiji Yeah, my only DJ gig really up until going to Japan with Dego was playing in my bedroom, basically. Tony Nwachukwu There’s a slight difference... Seiji Yeah, and when I got out there, it was really a baptism by fire. I remember feeling really physically ill before I went on at my first gig. I couldn’t eat, I was rushing to the toilet and all sorts, it was horrible. But that week I had to learn fast, so I managed to get over my fear. Since then I’ve been getting gigs off the back of my records. But I think I’ve actually been DJing a little bit too much recently. And, the same way with remixing, it’s taken away from the fact that I haven’t actually made an original piece of music in about a year or a year and a half. I mean, “Loose Lips” was the last production that I’ve done for myself that I just knocked out for the hell of it. Tony Nwachukwu Have you started on some new work? Seiji It was in the last one or two months that I really made a conscious effort to start to make sure that I make music for myself. I’ve invested a bit more money in my home studio, I’ve just bought myself a Wurlitzer, I’m getting that back from the restorers next week. I’m gonna teach myself harmony and stuff like that, start writing songs. Tony Nwachukwu Are you going to sing? Seiji If you’re lucky. [laughs] For now I really want to get into writing music and songwriting. Not that you’re going to be hearing any nasty ballads straight-away or anything like that, but at least some songs or just some scatty vocal grooves or stuff like that. Tony Nwachukwu Any chance to get the cello in the picture? Seiji Yes, there’ll probably be some cello coming back, but I’ve got to practice first because I haven’t been playing for ten years. So I’m all out of tune. So unless I just use the Auto-Tune... Tony Nwachukwu [laughs] Or a sample library. Do you still have your cello from school? Seiji I have actually played it, I was lying a little bit. Phil Asher is always encouraging me to play. A couple of times recently, he’s phoned me up and said, “Right, come down to the studio, bring your cello.” I’ve gone down there and played some really minimal string part that he has written for me on one of his remixes and it sort of gets submerged right down in the mix or something. But it makes me feel good, so... Tony Nwachukwu Can you think of any mixes off hand where you got some cello on one of Phil’s records? I actually didn’t know that so I’m going to go to my records and try and hear it. Seiji [Laughs] Ok, there is a Jody Watley remix he did recently. But, like I say, I’m so low in the mix, so you’re not going to hear me anyway. But it felt good to have my name on a record playing cello. Tony Nwachukwu What were your usual tools for making music? Seiji I started making electronic music on bits of equipment that I borrowed. The very first bits I used were a really basic sequencer and synth, I can’t even remember what they were. It was like a DX-something, the Yamaha – this flat thing – I don’t know, I can’t remember. That taught me the basics. Then I actually met a guy, who is a good friend of mine now, who had a studio, and I started to use that studio. And he had an Ensonic sampler, one of these really old ones and that sort of showed me the basics of sampling on that. He taught me how to use Cubase on the Atari and that was the main thing. From there, after I got serious about the music, I got an E-Mu sampler, an E-Mu 64, and just used that and the Atari. So for about five years, six years, I’ve just used an E-Mu 64 and the Atari to sequence. Any sort of keyboard sounds or anything like that, I used samples in the E-Mu. My music was pretty much all samples at that point anyway. Tony Nwachukwu And you’d take what you’ve worked on and Daz-I-Kue would mix it down? Seiji I started to do my own mix downs in the early days, but they sounded horrible. So as soon as there was a really good engineer around, I got him to help me. So since then Daz-I-Kue has been doing my mixdowns. I tend to do some basic writing at home, get some ideas together, develop the whole thing in terms of programming, do most of the programming at home and then take it to the studio to do recording of vocals or live stuff and then the mixdown. I’m the sort of person... I’m at the most creative when I’m at home on my own at night in my bedroom. If I’m under pressure and someone says, “OK, program a beat in front of us,” I can’t really do it. So that’s why I work at home. Tony Nwachukwu Is there some kind of cueing system for Daz in terms of mixes? You guys are quite busy. Seiji Yeah, he calls himself “the hardest working man in showbiz” or something like that, I can’t remember. But, yeah, he is very busy but he finds the time to do my stuff so I’m happy. Tony Nwachukwu So now you’ve got yourself a few nice bits of equipment, including the Wurlitzer EP 200. What else did you get yourself? Seiji Recently I just bought the Titanium G4 as well. I had to say goodbye to the Atari because it starting to flake on me, it was getting too old and I had to keep getting it repaired and all that kind of thing, it was getting too long. But I must say that I really regret that now because there was something about the Atari I really loved. And I haven’t been finding the Mac as easy as I thought. Tony Nwachukwu Have you pinpointed what it is about the Atari that you miss? Seiji One thing about it, it is very tactile. When you pressed the button of the mouse it went [loudly] clunk. When you press the button on the Mac it sounds [quietly] click. If you’re making music with computers, there’s this interface between you and your music. It helps to have some sort of manual input or to have that tactile something. And the thing about the Atari was, it was very immediate and the interface between you and your music didn’t seem to be that great. And then obviously, there is the clock aspect as well. There is this endless debate going on about the MIDI clock in the Atari is better than the MIDI clock in the PC, is better than the MIDI clock in the Mac and all this sort of thing. I mean, I don’t know because I’m not technically into that stuff, but there was definitely a feel to sequencing on the Atari that is difficult to get from more sophisticated computers and I don’t know why that is. They say it’s because it’s got a built-in MIDI port. And then others say, “It’s a little less sophisticated, the MIDI gets shuffled a little bit.” I don’t know what it was, but there’s a natural feel to programming on an Atari that is hard to get now from a Mac. Definitely, you can’t get it from a PC, as far as I’m concerned. I’ve heard about some interesting bits of equipment, like ideas about importing your MIDI files into your MPC to get that kind of old school swing back in your music when it’s all feeling a bit square.

Title: Seiji and Steinski

Seiji and Steinski
For this special session during the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, Bugz In The Attic’s Seiji and the one like Steinski team up for a little chatter about Pro Tools, Cubase, and equipment vs soul. Press play for some serious double trouble, for real.
Transcript: Seiji I think it would be better that we talk about technical things, rather than embarrass ourselves in the studio, when I’m sure that probably most of you can use Reason. I think people are surprised when they find out I made the majority of my music on just the Cubase Atari, the MIDI and the Commodore 64 [computer] for producing all the sounds. Including all of the synth sounds, chopping up the vocals, putting on samples, all those kinds of things. Whereas Steve has got everything on ProTools, obviously. And the common theme we both agreed on was that there seems to be a sort of obsession with gear and technology, which neither of us seem to feel the same way about, I think. Steinski One of the things that happened with me working in the New York metropolitan area with a lot of guys that have grown up in a world of technical music making and working in the studio, is that I grabbed onto ProTools and learned how to use it. And now I have a ProTools 5.1 system with a whole lot of plug-ins and that’s fine, works great for me. Of course now, I’m constantly meeting guys who say, “You're going to be getting Protools HD, right?!” Well, no. There is really no reason for me to be sampling at 196k – you know, dogs can’t hear that – why do I want to spend another $25,000 on a box that allows me to do that? And then there are other people saying, “Protools 6 is out now, you're going to get OSX 10?” And I'm like, well, no, because then I’d have to reinvest in all the plug-ins and I also have to learn the OSX. And I am not going to get a G5 and all of the other things. But I work with people to whom this is the logical next step. You must have that. Fact of the matter is that I don’t really think you must have that. Not at all. Because no one who’s buying your record or who isn’t buying your record, is not going to buy it because... “Oh man, listen to that, he didn’t sample at a 196k! Poo! What else you got here?” This is not logical, this is not sensible. It’s a consumerist attitude towards it. It’s like if you’re playing a guitar, you need to learn how to play the guitar. Having a better guitar is not going to help you to learn it better necessarily. If the strings are closer to the fretboard, it might be a little easier to learn some of the changes and the things you need to do. But for the most part, you just need to practice, you need to learn, you need to know it thoroughly. So that’s one thing that seems to be a good area to chat about, is the urge to upgrade, the urge to move on to the next version and it becomes an end in itself. Like I said, I think it's a very consumerist attitude. You can get completely lost in this and really end up only end up skimming the surface of the capability of the software that you are talking about or the music you are trying to make, because you are really more caught up with the wrong aspects. You are not sitting there thinking, “Great, this is how I can use this to make a better beat or make the vocal more sinuous or whatever you would like to do.” It simplifies everything to “I got to have the new thing.” Seiji I think it becomes a distraction. Especially if you’re not so confident in terms of production... Because it’s easier to get distracted by that, than to actually... Steinski The belief is that the newer thing will help you get over the problem you are confronting, which – at least in my case – I have found to be relatively rare. The new thing doesn’t help me get over it, it generally presents half a dozen problems, which are good distractions from the thing you were trying to solve in the first place. You know, “It doesn’t do that, the book said it should do that, why doesn’t it do that? There must be some preset because it's not working correctly, blah blah blah.” And four hours later you’ve lost whatever idea you were originally trying to go for and you are just caught up in the back alleys of the software. So that’s a point we wanted to make, and is what we would like to address. Seiji For me, I’ve actually found upgrading to new equipment has presented problems for me. I feel like I lost my way a little bit in the last year, struggling to get used to the new technology. Being a bit useless on computers generally, I’ve really been struggling with Logic, so I could maybe do with coming to the Red Bull Academy and taking some courses or something. Moving to Logic was... I don't know, I regret having to leave the Atari behind, just because it’s becoming obsolete. But that it was a tactile, easy-to-use software. Now that I'm using Logic, I find myself stuck with these intellectual problems I have to overcome, and I feel further away from being able to instantly make music. Actually, over the next couple of years I will be looking to buy as many Ataris as I can find, get them all in good working order and have them stored, so that as they break down, I can put the next one into use again. Also, on the sampling side, I did experiment with trying to use things like the EXS 24 and Battery and stuff like that. But again, I found not being able to have my hands on the instrument and not having the audition buttons going click, click, click and feel like I am somehow in touch with the sound that I am making...that really didn’t work well for me, as was using Recycle to chop everything up for me. That was a laziness thing. But I've found that when I'm a bit more diligent and I chop everything by hand, that’s where a lot of my creativity comes from. In my creative process where I'm chopping something up by hand and as a result accidents happen or I hear things in the break or I hear things in the sample that I wouldn’t hear if I just put it through Recycle and got it to chop it up for me. So there’s definitely a lot to be said for the old school methods of working. Steinski I think part of that again is you can be too efficient. The new thing can do too much. I find myself a lot with the melodic loop up here or the melodic line and the drums down on another couple of channels. And the drums sort of fit and they sort of don’t. And yeah, I suppose I could use the version of Recycle that occurs in Pro Tools – the Beat Detective – which separates everything for you like this. [snaps his finger] And I don’t like to use it for exactly the same reasons that Paul was talking about. Because as I'm sitting there cutting it up and moving it and shifting things around a little bit, there's all manner of possibilities that seem to come up. “Oh, this actually sounds better if it were a hair behind” and “Oh, I could just get rid of this and it would be fine.” It becomes part of the creative process. Seiji Definitely the ’80s, in soul and jazz music, a lot of it really suffered for this kind of this kind of need to upgrade to the new sound, that everyone had to be moving with the times. From having the wonderful sounds of the ’70s analog gear, we then went into the ’80s and some of our great heroes of soul started using horrible, horrible synthesizer sounds. I think the [Roland preset] Crystal Rhodes is probably the biggest offender. As a result, a whole decade of music almost became really horribly unlistenable. Steinski You can get caught up with the current big sound, and you go back and you listen to it a year later and go, “What was I thinking of? Oh god, it is awful!” You get in that fever, like, “Wow! It’s gonna be a hit!” and it's like, “No, no, no, it’s not that easy.” Audience Member So what you are saying is, it’s the painter, not the brush. Does the brush contribute? How much? Is choosing your own software still an issue? Steinski It’s just a matter of learning what you got. If you are comfortable with it, and if it can do in the end what you would like. There might be some extra steps involved and it’s less efficient, I think that’s fine. Seiji I think some really great music and innovative sounds have come out of people having to push the technology that is available to them to do what they want to do. Either back in the days when the technology wasn't that advanced, or situations where people just don’t just have the budget to do it, it means they really wanted to get this sound, but they have to do the closest approximation using the equipment they’ve got. And they end up coming up with something that is brand new, this sounds really crazy. There's something to be said for just having a big piece of gear, just working with that and pushing it as far as you can go. [Bob Moog stands up] Steinski Oh, Mr. Moog! What can I possibly tell you? [laughs] Bob Moog I wanted to comment on this painter versus brush business here. So far everything you said is... I wonder what I am going to say tomorrow. What you say is so true, even though it will put all of us engineers out of work. Steinski [laughs] Never, never! Bob Moog Yes, the brush matters, but not by itself. The brush matters to the extent that you're comfortable using it, that the ideas can flow through your brush beyond to whatever you're painting. Nobody can hold a brush up and say, “This is the brush for everybody for all painting.” Steinski That’s very much the case. I'm happy to be working in ProTools because there is so much at this point that I don’t know, and that in my copious spare time I can sit down and go, “Well, you know, I'm not that familiar with how he MIDI part of this works, let me hook up a couple of virtual synthesizers here and see what can get happening.” Because all of a sudden, I find, “Oh, what do you know, I can get an arpeggiated bassline here” and I can tell it what range to work in and it's like “oh, that’s smoking!” And it's okay, alright, it sounds a little mechanical, but I can then bounce it to a track and mess with it. It’s digital editing stuff. It’s wonderful because you want to keep moving to the end and you won’t ever get to the end. It keeps moving away from you a little bit, that next function. I can’t sell people on ProTools. At the same time, don’t forget that before there was software, it was just people in front of microphones with instruments. What may seem like the best and most convenient thing for you... a lot of records you like were made with no technical stuff whatsoever except a couple of microphones and a tape machine. And a really hot drummer and a really good bass player. So getting caught up in the technical aspect of things is a blind alley. Seiji That’s the criticism of listeners who don’t like electronic music. They were like, “Where's the human touch in this music?” Perhaps the only way to get that is to become familiar with your equipment that it really becomes like a real instrument. You can’t really do that if you're constantly changing your technology. You have to get a feeling for it, so it becomes something that you directly express through. When I started using Reason and Recycle, for instance, it was making beats, but I realized that they sounded like beats that anyone could have done and my particular signature sound had completely disappeared. Alex Phountzi from Bugz in the Attic said, “Yeah, Recycle is like having pre-chopped carrots.” [audience laughter] There's no good ingredients there! Audience Member I do have the feeling that too much technology can be limiting, if you’re trying to do methods that were formed in the ’70s. Seiji Maybe you're right. For instance, looking at kids growing up now with technology, using computers in a way I would probably never would be able to, they're doing that at the age of 6 or 7, it might be completely different. Maybe these kids are going to be so close to the technology that they are like instruments at their fingertips. And that’s fantastic for them. I can only speak for myself – I'm part of a generation that falls into a gap a bit, where computers were around me when I was growing up, but they weren’t everywhere in society and I wasn’t so interested in programming them or anything. I’m sort of caught between trying to make music in a traditional way coming from a classical background as well, playing the cello, that’s maybe how I approached making electronic music. Steinski One other thing... the idea of having lots of technology around you in order to make music is easy. Unless you have an extremely strong vision of what you are going to do and you really understand the stuff that you have available, it’s very easy to become bogged down in the choices. We could do this and that and so often one ends up doing nothing under those circumstances. Nothing happens, because you take a tentative step and if we're doing that then we're not really doing that... One of the better exercises that I did with a friend of mine was, we would get together every week and we each bring about six samples of anything. And we said, we're going to make a song out of this this afternoon. It wasn’t always great. But just saying, “This is all we have,” it was liberating in fact. We didn't have to worry about, “Let’s get another snare sound, that's not the right snare sound.” No, we have to work with what we have here, what are we gonna do? It was great. It was really the right thing to do. Like I said, it doesn’t necessarily turn into great work, but it’s an exercise. It’s like doing scales. Figuring out how to use what you got in front of you. Seiji I feel the same way. It’s really what I found out with remixing. When I started remixing, I found it really easy because there was already a limit to what I could use. You're not getting lost in endlessly searching for the next sample – this is what you've got to work with, you've got to make the best of that. It’s kind of similar if you are limited to one piece of gear and you get the most of that piece of gear, it’s like working with a set range of samples. If you get the most out of your samples, you got to push them and milk them for everything you can. Steinski Which is kind of what makes remixing fun. I’ve done a couple of remixes too, and it is wonderful for that. Here is the piece of the melodic line that they want you to use and to me the hard work is already done then. You don’t have to come up with the grand concept, it's sort of done. Seiji There is a creative seed already. Bob Moog: [standing up] I’d like everybody to know here that you are extremely unlikely to read anything like this in a magazine. The simple reason is that the magazines exist to serve their advertisers, not the readers. They serve the advertisers because they are the ones who pay the bills. If there was something in it that suggested, that we don’t need the latest whizzbang of any of the advertisers, that’s a good way to lose an advertiser. And any magazine, even the really good ones, will think twice before they do that. I can’t remember ever reading the kind of wisdom that you guys are according this afternoon. And that worries me that that's the state of the musicians’ press today. Audience Member Getting back to the case of working with technology... if someone listens to you guys today, it might look like you are knocking down technology, and I don’t think that you meant that. Because sometimes upgrading your software and finding out that you don’t need all that stuff, sort of upgrades that older software that you got and you feel more assured about what you are doing, right? Seiji I don’t feel one way or the other, I must say. I don't worship technology and I don’t hate it. It’s just what I use, what is available to me to make music in a context I make it. When I was younger, what I had in my hand was a cello. And then when I got to a certain age – and because of the culture and the social situation I was involved in and the music that was surrounding me – then what I had to make music was technology. It’s not really a good thing, or a bad thing. I don’t have emotional feelings towards technology either way. Audience Member But it's a good attitude to at least know technology, to know what's going on, not necessarily to buy it or achieve it. Seiji I don’t know. There is amazing music made by people who locked themselves in studios and haven’t seen the outside world for five years. I don’t think that you really have to keep up with the latest thing. You even don’t have to know technology to make good music. I was saying to Steve earlier that you almost get to a situation now where everyone is using digital equipment, everyone's using Logic and plug-ins and swapping cracked plug-ins, like, “Yeah I got this great plug-in and it sounds just like...” a certain piece of analog gear that is still available for absolutely next to nothing if you go and look on eBay. So it seems a bit back to front. Like, why don't you go and get that bit of gear, hook it up, sample it, or even just use it! It just seems really ridiculous, and a really long-winded way of going around getting the valve compressor sound. I know they're a bit expensive but you can make them, actually. So why not use a real one? Audience Member Sometimes the emulation is the only thing you got access to. Because you’re talking from England. In Portugal, if I had a Mellotron, oh I’d be happy! Seiji OK, fair enough, you are right. When it comes to classic bits of kit, fair enough. But then again, you hear fantastic tracks – Madlib for instance, he's using a bit of kit that's so obsolete, I don’t even know what it is. It's some Emu sampler he takes on the road with him that he says is worth about $300. And if you listen to his music, you’ll agree it's neither here nor there. The quality of sound is not really the thing. Some of his productions sound awful in terms of the mixdown and if you were analyzing the frequencies that were going on in there, but there's such a heavy vibe on there it doesn’t really matter, does it?

Steinski
It all began in the early ’80s, when Steinski, an incurable beat junkie, started schooling his friend Doug DeFranco in the joys of hip-hop. A short while later they entered a contest with a track made using tape and a razor blade, and received a standing ovation from judges including Arthur Baker, Afrika Bambaataa, Shep Pettibone and Jellybean Benitez. The track, “Lesson 1,” was the first of its kind to be created with samples – its closest contemporaries being tracks by Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash, who made sonic collages using only turntables. They financed a pressing of its follow-up, “Lesson 2,” themselves and distributed it to DJs and radio stations. But it was “Lesson 3: The History Of Hip Hop” that perhaps pushed the copyright infringement a little far, and, as we found out at the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, it was removed from shelves, making their bootlegs some of the most sought-after mixes in the history of hip-hop.
Hosted by Jeff “Chairman” Mao This gentleman had a very interesting, lengthy, unique journey to get here today. Most of it within the last 20 hours so he’s a little concerned, you know, for some reason, that some of you wouldn’t be familiar with his music. So we’d like to start just by playing a piece, and it goes something like this. (music: Double Dee & Steinski – “Lesson 1”) Steinski And a friend of ours, who produced radio commercials for CBS, came in one day with a copy of Billboard magazine, threw it on the table and said, “Listen, Tommy Boy is doing a contest to remix that record and you guys really should enter.” We looked at it and they had a record called “Play That Beat Mr. DJ” by MC Globe and Wiz Kid, which I already had a copy of. They wanted you to remix it in five minutes using any elements you wanted and we decided, “Yeah, sure, why don’t we do that?” We went into the studio on a Saturday morning. Douglas picked me up with six crates of records and he had some records in the trunk of the car. We went into the studio and finished on Sunday night. It’s the fastest we ever did anything. We sent in the tape and I kept on doing what I was doing working as a copywriter and copy supervisor in a big advertising agency. One day I came out of a meeting, went in my office and my secretary came in saying, “Hey, you won that contest! Tommy Boy called.” I said, “Really?” She said, “Yeah, the guy himself – Tommy of Tommy Boy!” I said, “No, kiddin’, that’s great!” So I called him back and he said, “Yeah, you guys won. Who are you? What kind of mastermixer has a secretary?” At the time – I mean, I’m old now, we were old then considering that our competition was 70 other entries, which were all done by 18 and 20 year-olds – we came in and I was over 30, Douglas was probably 30 at that point. We went to meet them. It was very complimentary. They had a number of people there who wanted to meet us because we had done this nice tape. We won… we split $100, we each got a T-shirt, we got the entire Tommy Boy catalog which was 15 to 20 records including Afrika Bambaataa’s “Planet Rock.” They asked us for a couple of copies of the tape on reel-to-reel because part of the contest was, they were going to send the mix out to a number of urban radio stations, who had promised to play it at least once, as the winner of the contest. And lo and behold, to ours and everyone else’s great amazement, within a week it was a top ten request item on every station in the US that was playing it. Two weeks after that people were standing on the corner selling aircheck cassettes of it for $20 and in London you could buy an aircheck cassette of it for £60. That amazed no one more than us. Because we didn’t really see ourselves as glamorous recording artists. We didn’t have any ambitions, we were just two guys who liked to hang around and we made a record and that was that. So we made another and that was based on James Brown, thinking, “Let’s do a record of all these great James Brown cuts.” And the same thing happened, except there wasn’t a contest this time. We just became a request item and, you know, there we were again. So at that point Tommy Boy was involved with a book publisher that was going to do a book about hip-hop. They came to us with a number of records and asked if we could do another mix based on these records. They said, “Don’t worry about the copyrights or anything, ha ha ha.” [laughs] It wasn’t the kind of thing anybody was worrying about at that time. And we made the record that Jeff [the interviewer] just played for you, “The History of Hip-Hop.” The same thing happened again. At that time it was wonderful. We were living in an apartment in Brooklyn, we had our own little 8-track studio. And by the way, that record you just heard was tape and records on an 8-track tape. I mean, I use ProTools now and I’m dynamite at it, but that was Douglas with a razor blade and eight tracks. In fact, it is all six tracks except one point where he uses the last pair of tracks. So... that’s some hot-shit work there. Just representing my friend Douglas here. What happened after that was... I had become a freelancer, quit my job. Douglas had quit his job and didn’t like being broke as much as I did, so he went back to work. I then made another record with a more emotional/sociological bent to it called “The Motorcade Sped On,” which was about John F. Kennedy’s assassination. Most of you, I’m sure, have never heard of him or the assassination but a president of the United States got assassinated, it was all over the media. When I made that record, around 15 years ago, there were a lot more people listening to hip-hop who remembered the thing happening. And to take the media elements of this assassination and to set it to music really affected people. So that got stapled to the cover of the NME in England along with a few other items and all of a sudden I was an item in England. I could go on forever. [smiles] Jeff “Chairman” Mao Before we get onto that... I think, as far as the “Lessons” go, we heard “Lesson 3” just now and we’ll play some of the other stuff as well. But I guess maybe the obvious first question is, had you ever heard anything like what you had done before? What was the template that inspired you to do that? It’s pretty unique, as far as hip-hop goes. Obviously you had two turntables and a mixer but you didn’t really have anything [at the time] that had so many different elements at once. Steinski Douglas and I were obviously hanging around down at the Roxy a lot and we both had backgrounds in doing commercials. So we were very concerned with a number of things. It had to move quick enough to be interesting, which is why there’s almost nothing in there longer than four bars, maybe eight bars. You had to be able to hear everything, it had to sound like a finished product. Again, at this point this was all Douglas’s doing. I had nothing to do with the technical quality other than to sit there and say, [in a comical voice] “Hey, this is not loud enough.” That was my entire contribution. That and pick the cuts we were using. What we both shared, also, was a history of listening to New York radio from the time when we were very small. And since I was older than Douglas, I was listening to stuff when Douglas was not. And the first thing that I heard, which was – believe it or not – a monster hit on radio in the United States, I first heard in a Chinese restaurant when I was five on a juke box. And that’s this. (music: Buchanan and Goodman – “The Flying Saucer”) And that is the work of two guys named Buchanan and Goodman, who had a very big hit in the United States with that. Nobody had heard anything faintly like that before. It’s absolutely surreal. I heard it when I was a kid and Douglas heard it. They made something like 50 other records. Every time something happened, they would do another record like this where they had some crazy theme – a courtroom scene, a reporter and they’d cut in all these songs. They were known as “Flying Saucer” records, break-in records, cut-in records. And they managed, because several of them were challenged in court – early foreshadowings of death and... They got around it by calling them parodies. So that became the standard by which you could do that. Now, I doubt it would hold up – to be able to use, without paying copyright, a piece of someone else’s song. And I think that’s also where this great myth of, “Oh, you know, if you just use two bars you’re allowed...?” And it’s like, [waves finger] “Uh uh.” So they got away with it, nobody else did. Jeff “Chairman” Mao And they did about how many records do you think? Steinski 30 or 40. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Up until when did they stop? Steinski Dicky Goodman died about six or seven years ago, maybe not even that long ago. I think he was doing them... He just liked doing them, they were fun to do. He couldn’t get them on the radio after a while. They didn’t sell but he kept doing them. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So they were more or less a comedy team or... ? Steinski I’d say yeah. It was considered radio comedy, you know, [makes finger quotes gesture] “novelty” records. That was a very direct thing that Douglas and I both knew about and drew on the idea of this, very fast, quick cutting-type stuff. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So I guess when you first heard hip-hop, this appealed to you as you had this sensibility of mixing and matching different things. I think it might be interesting to try and describe that time right before you did the “Lessons” a little bit more in depth. Just how you experienced that, as far as... Did you hear any hip-hop records that struck you in the same way? Steinski Oh sure, yeah. Keith LeBlanc’s “Malcolm X.” That was different because he had this loping beat that pretty much kept on and he dropped spoken word over top of it. Now obviously, Douglas and I have an enormous affection for spoken word records. My records almost universally use it very very liberally, legally and illegally. The musical qualities of speech is a very big deal to me. So the Malcolm X thing was there... In terms of other stuff that was around, I really liked Laurie Anderson’s records, they were very hip – “O Superman,” “Walk the Dog” were certainly very influential for me. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I guess, also, it’s important to remember that the clubs which you mention – Negril and Roxy – are clubs in New York City in the early ‘80s downtown. And this was a time when a lot of cats from the Bronx and uptown were coming downtown and starting to mix with the downtown crowd. Steinski Yeah, and Bambaataa would play anything that he thought was funky. Anything, anything, anything, which was wonderful. A liberal field that is noted more by its loss these days than not, at least in larger clubs. I think in smaller clubs you’d still find a lot of really adventurous DJs. But that was a time when the downtown sensibility of people like Laurie Anderson and David Byrne and some of the bands like Konk were heard in clubs that were playing ESG, that were playing early rap records by Peter Brown, stuff that Peter Brown had produced. It was pretty great. You could hear records with sound effects on them, Davey D’s first record “One For the Treble” had that car peeling away that got scratched, which was pretty cool. It was a time of experimentation, not like now when people go to a club and say, “What kind of hip-hop are they playing? Are they playing commercial club bangers with keyboard beats, so we all know what it sounds like? Was it beats or indie or all loops?” It wasn’t like that. It was just anything that was coming down the pipe that was funky, it was, “Yeah, fair game.” It was a fine time, it was a great time to be involved and it certainly shaped my sensibilities for good or ill. I am not sitting here because I am some “bling bling” producer who flew in on his private jet with a diamond in his tooth. Nonetheless, it opened up the possibilities of what a person could do. I think you do see it in lots of independent hip-hop now. Jeff “Chairman” Mao It would be interesting to hear exactly what the process was like when you began making these “Lesson” records. Did you have an idea of what you wanted to start with? Steinski That’s pretty much all we ever had, what the opening was going to be. [tweaking his hands] “Well let’s take this and then we maybe can move it into that.” And then it was always, “Well, now what?” and then “Well... let’s try this,” “Nah, doesn’t work, let’s try this,” “Yeah, maybe, let’s put that on.” And then we’d find something else that worked and then we’d realize what we really liked about that first thing was that we wanted to loop something. Loop a piece out of it for, say, two bars. So we’d put a couple of loops in there and then, [making turning and chopping hand gestures] “Ah, you know, we’ve got this guy saying this, let’s do that and” – now we come to the pay off – “if he finishes right here then it’ll be a great, dramatic opening and we can sneak a little noise in there to try and juice the transition.” And that’s how... Basically, Douglas did it and I was coming in with lots of elements and sitting there going, “Well, you know, maybe if it got faster here or louder there,” or this, that or the other. I was learning from him at the time, because now I make a lot of records without him – although I still make records with him and we have a very good time – I learned a lot of these techniques from him at the time. And these were things we would just be noticing, like, “Why did some segues work at the Roxy and others not?” Well, the way the scratching worked, they would let it go a little bit and then pull it back and then let it go, and they would cut the first record, then the silence and then they would let the second record go. So this was all us learning on the dancefloor, as we were going there every week. You get it imprinted in your genetic code, pretty much. Anybody here who is a working club DJ knows that. The more you do it, the more you know, “This one’s going to work, boom!” And even if it gets a little old after a while, because it works all the time and you don’t have anything to replace it with, so you keep doing it. Whatever “it” is. That’s how we learned. We watched these segues happen and we saw these techniques applied. And we mixed them with Douglas’s abilities in the studio, my selection of records and our mutual love of... “Oh, if we use this it would be really funny. Let’s use Bugs Bunny. Let’s use the Marx Brothers.” We both like that “drop-it (squeaks) hoohoo kind of feel to it.” Jeff “Chairman” Mao You just mentioned briefly talking about legalities. Obviously, this record was in every true sense of the word an underground smash, being bootlegged and available only on cassette copy and whatnot. Was it frustrating to not have gone any further? Or did you feel that you’d gotten the most mileage out of it, because of what the limitations were, legally? Steinski At the time our approach to this was a little different. We weren’t two young producers who wanted to make our lives in hip-hop. We both had jobs. I was essentially an advertising agency executive and Douglas was a fairly highly paid studio engineer. We did this thing, we met all the people in the world we’d ever wanted to meet and then some. And we had the gratification that people all over were listening and really diggin’ this record. It didn’t occur to us that we should exploit this and perhaps that’s to our detriment. It was a really long time before we made another record. I kept making records as a hobby, to sort of learn how to do it better and better. When I finally got a hold of ProTools, that was when I sort of got a rocket up my butt and was like, “Oh, OK, I could do this, I could do that…” That’s when we made the remix of “Jazzy Sensation” for Tommy Boy’s 10th or 15th anniversary. That was when we really showed the ProTools influence because all of a sudden we were working with 64 tracks, we had digital editing, we could stretch stuff, we could put tons of effects on it, we did all kinds of stuff with that. Possibly our best record together, I think. And also wildly illegal. As far as the legal issues go, I mean it’s obvious. We were – and are – given the choice, total thieves. We have no regard whatsoever for copyright. It doesn’t mean that our records should be sold, it doesn’t mean it should be right, but it’s what we do. We are audio collage artists and if you just take away the audio part, we are right there with artists whose work is hanging on museum walls and gallery walls as collage artists. The only difference is that our work is digitally replicable. Therefore the damage, if you wish, can spread much wider than a Joseph Cornell collage of a lot of recognizable elements. Because it’s only one of his works and there can be theoretically zillions of ours. And, also, Joseph Cornell is working in the visual medium. We are working in a medium, where copyright has grown from, “What?,” to a minor annoyance to a plutonium bomb. But it hasn’t stopped us yet. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What was your reaction upon hearing stuff that was influenced by some of your records. You could probably point to Prince Paul’s stuff with De La Soul and the Bomb Squad, Coldcut, etc.? Steinski The Bomb Squad and Prince Paul, I am so flattered to think that our stuff would have shown up in theirs. I think that Paul is the closest thing hip-hop has to an authentic genius. And the Bomb Squad stuff was just amazing when it came out. I didn’t know what to think about that stuff, it was so incredible. Coldcut, I’ve become really friendly with them and I have a very close association with Ninja Tune now. A lot of artists [on Ninja Tune] reflect that in certain ways. Probably Kid Koala. He has amazing talents in many other directions. Certainly his use of spoken word reflects that. We’ve seen our stuff show up in a lot of different places and I’m always very flattered. I’m always very gratified that it strikes a note in people. I got into advertising not to become rich, but because I thought this was a cool way to project what I think into other people’s minds. When I got disillusioned with advertising it didn’t mean I got disillusioned with doing that. Getting them to dance is a part of it, getting them to listen is a part of it and the technique is a part of it. And that’s very gratifying to see. Jeff “Chairman” Mao There’s been your “Lessons” are one, two and three and more than a couple of people have recorded a Lesson four. Steinski Oh yeah, sorry folks, jetlag. Chemist and Shadow, absolutely. Both of whom are cool people that I have met, very nice. I performed with them, they were nice enough to get me on stage to do two of the lessons live at the Skratch Piklz demise party at the Fillmore in San Francisco. That was quite an evening. I missed a good half of my cues, I’d say. The biggest thing that came out of the that evening, besides the fact that I remember I was walking into the bathroom of the Fillmore thinking, “Boy! Jimi Hendrix used that toilet too,” was just pretty amazing. The other thing that came out of it was the staggering professionalism of Chemist and Shadow in what they had done. They had broken down the instrumental part of two of our records completely and recreated them perfectly on four turntables. And when I say perfectly, I mean so perfectly that I showed up... Now, granted, we didn’t have much rehearsal time, we had only four hours to rehearse. My samples weren’t tuned for speed, I thought I will just slop them down there, because I thought their record speeds will be all over. But, no… Jeff “Chairman” Mao What did you bring with you? Steinski I used an Akai S1000 sampler and was loading it through zip discs and had a keyboard that was labeled with all the samples in my nice little homebrew fashion, which more or less worked. You can see me on stage with them in the movie Scratch. Them holding down the fort and me kinda messing up. But still, it was a thrill and an amazing thing to do. Don’t forget for a long time I was out of the world of hip-hop, for the most part. I didn’t like to listen to gangster rap, was not aware that there was an underground scene happening, that there was independent hip-hop going on. I just went back into my record collection, had a radio show, played a little bit of hip-hop but played all kinds of stuff. It was a very electic thing, I played bluegrass, played old jazz, modern classical and all kinds of stuff. And then someone walked into my studio saying, “Hey you, you see this record from this guy DJ Shadow, Endtroducing.....? He namechecked you guys on this.” I looked at the record and thought, “Damn! Who is this guy?” I had no idea. Same thing with Cut Chemist – “Lessons.” “Did you know this guy did a ‘Lessons’ record? They did??” It was all news to me. That was part of the great awakening of coming back into the world of making records. Jeff “Chairman” Mao There’ve been quite a few other lessons. Are you tired of lessons? Steinski [laughs] Using the word “lessons,” unfortunately, made it sound like [exaggerating in hip-hop style], “And now we gonna drop some science on y’all, yo. So pay attention!” Really what it came down to was, I had instruction records with some guy saying, “Lesson so and so,” on them. That was a good introduction. So we did that once and we did it again. We’re totally not coming into the room, trying to show anybody what was what. I have no bad feelings for the other Lessons out there. I met DJ Bombjack, who did “Lesson 7.” And there are a couple of other lessons running around. I saw bootlegs of Ultimate Lessons, Shadow’s live stuff in France and all that. And people come up, “Didn’t you get really pissed off about it?” No, I wish I thought of it, actually. I’m not pissed off. Other than that, that was pretty much it. Jeff “Chairman” Mao And what about if we get to “Lesson 78” or something, what about that? Steinski [laughs] Well, we’ll have to see about that. Actually, the one thing that I don’t want is to get so thoroughly associated with the old school that everybody’s like, “Yeah, let’s see Steinski play some old hip-hop records.” It’s like, “Thank you, no!” I’d like to move myself into some more modern point of view here. You know, I’m trying... Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you want to play something? Steinski Let’s play something from this and then we probably ought to take some questions, as I’m tired of talking about what a fabulous guy I am. This is a mix that I did when I came back from the Fillmore playing with Chemist and Shadow. Coldcut mentioned to me, very casually, about making a mix for their radio show, which was, again, very flattering. So I sat down and my first thouht was, “I’ll do a mix like I used to do for my radio shows on WMFU, where I just pick out a whole bunch of different records, do some jazzy segues and let go like that.” But I started working on it and thought, “No, this really isn’t going to work. They don’t play bluegrass, they don’t play modern classical music. What I want to do for them is do a rhythmic mix and I want to do the best I can.” I thought it would take me like two weeks or a month. It took me a year and a half. I tried to pawn it off on Douglas to mix – it was at that point eight gigs [gigabytes] on a drive, which I brought over to his studio. He called me up and said, “You know, it takes 15 minutes to just open this job in ProTools?! I can’t mix this thing, take it away!” After a couple of months I mixed it, revising it extensively while I did it. And I used a whole bunch of stuff, as you can imagine. This is a piece of it. (music: Steinski – “Untitled Mix”) That is a New York perfomance artist called Danny Hoch, who has a CD called Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop, named after the show that he did. The show is excellent, CD is excellent. That is a severely edited piece of one of his characters, who’s a mainstream rapper and who is talking, basically, about how ethically deficient he is. I set it over a couple of different beats that were all working together. It was a lot of fun to do and, again, it’s narrative. It’s a guy talking, I like people talking. Very important to me. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Where did you get [the name] Steinski? Steinski Very quickly when we had to come up with a name for the contest entry. Actually, it wasn’t even mine, it was a friend of mine. Douglas had already come up with Double D. He called himself Double D. And we had just finished it [the track], and were about to send it in and I was having lunch with a friend of mine. And she said, “And who you’re going to be? Steinski?” Because “ski” was a suffix that was being added to lot of names. “Joeski” and “Bobski” and like that. So she thought that it would be absolutely hilarious, that I might be Steinski. And I said, “Yeah, I think I will.” The lesson there is be careful what kind of name you choose. You might be living with it for a long time. I know DJ Yoda in Britain regrets it terribly, you know?

Tim Westwood
Tim Westwood is something of a British radio legend. As the voice of hip-hop on the BBC throughout the ’90s and early ’00s, Westwood became something like English Funkmaster Flex – ubiquitous, whether you loved him or not. At the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, Westwood explained his philosophy for breaking records, coming up and how the son of an Anglican bishop came to represent a culture born on the other side of the Atlantic.
Hosted by Shaheen Ariefdien What was it like at the time you got involved and what attracted you to this? Tim Westwood I started off as a club DJ. Originally, I used to carry boxes for a soundsystem in Northwest London, I was just a box boy. That’s where you hump the records into the club. Shaheen Ariefdien For free then? Tim Westwood Yeah, you just do that for free – you were humping the big speakers in there, setting up [the soundsystem]. And then what was happening, is at that early part of a party, like if it was in a house or if it was like in a hall, like a community hall, none of the DJs wanted to play while there was nobody there. So that’s when I used to jump on the decks and that’s when I got the real love for it. You know, just putting on records and just being the DJ, even though there was nobody in the dance. So from there, then I had a job as a glass collector in a club called Gossips in the West End of London. Shaheen Ariefdien Sorry, what was that? Tim Westwood A glass collector. What a glass collector is, is if you are in a party and you’re getting your drink on and you’re putting your glasses down, there is like some kid with no money at all, collecting those glasses and washing them and putting them back behind the bar. I was running around in clubs the whole time when I was a kid. And then from there, I got an opening to be the warm-up DJ at that club. That club had two great DJs. It had David Rodigan, who is quite a legendary reggae DJ back home. I think in a lot of ways people don’t know Rodigan back then as the force that he was back in the day. But as a kid I grew up listening to Rodigan on Capital Radio and at that time there was no pirate radio back home. So, that was your only outlet for reggae music and that was at the era when reggae music was being called ragga, at the era of like Yellowman. You know Yellowman, then came Shabba Ranks and the whole DJ thing off the back. So I was his warm-up DJ at Gossips and as a young kid, that was just… Shaheen Ariefdien What did you play back then? Tim Westwood Warming up for Rodigan, I played reggae. It was like reggae and also the other thing back home was called jazz-funk. It was just soul music and shit like that, you know Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, James Brown. So, you know, that’s what we were spinning in the clubs at that time. And there was another DJ called Steve Walsh as well, who was like a very big DJ in that era, may he rest in peace. And what happened off the back of that, that was just as hip-hop started to happen. It was a real street club, you know, real ghetto spot and the crowd wanted the hip-hop. So I just started playing more and more of it and then suddenly that was an early hip-hop club and I was a hip-hop DJ. So it wasn’t like a conscious decision, but it was like following to what was going on for the party I was playing. So that was Gossips, that was like my early years. And then looking at my club history there, we used to do a Saturday lunchtime at a club called Spats, which was actually a gay club. But they used let to us hire it Saturday lunchtime 12 till three and that was where we used to play nothing but electro. And that was nothing but like four hours of lunchtime breakdancing, body-popping and all of that. One thing, which I always remember in my career now is to see how big hip-hop is now. I’ve done hip-hop when it was small and I’ve done hip-hop when it was broke and nothing was going on for anyone and I certainly love it as it is now. I definitely respect it back then, but to see how big and powerful and rich it is now, that’s the real revolution, which hip-hop has given us and I think that is a beautiful thing. And then from there, I went to work at People’s Club, I mean I’ve done a lot of other parties in London, but Peoples Club… the guy who ran Gossips was the first black guy in London to own a club - and he gave me more opportunity. Shaheen Ariefdien What year are we talking about? Tim Westwood Man, it must have been in like ’80, ’81. That’s when we started out. And then Ken Suttle was the dude who owned the People’s Club. And the People’s Club was legal for two years and then it was illegal for like 18 years. He lost his license, but he used to bribe the police. So that party used to start at ten, used to get full about four in the morning and then finish about twelve midday on Friday. And that’s where I really learned how to DJ. What was important at that time, Jive records had their studios up in Willesden and groups like Whodini used to come over to London and record for four months. Run DMC used to come over and record, Beastie Boys was always over and they used to come every week to this spot. We had these enormous artists in this sort of real ghetto spot – it was crazy. It was like the early days of crack cocaine there as well and I remember like six in the morning and there would just be this cloud of coke over the whole place. As a young guy growing up in that, I certainly learned a lot of hip-hop just being with those artists. And at that time I was on LWR. LWR was one of the early pirates. To tell you just a bit about the pirate technology, those early pirates like Invicta and Horizon, which were the first pirates back home, they were very much controlled by these white guys who were from Essex, which is out of town. And LWR managed to get the technology on how to build a transmitter and that was the first street-owned, street-run station. That was like the founding father for all the pirates back home and the pirate scene is perhaps the most important scene out there in the UK. It’s real hot with the DJs, all the DJs come through the pirates and LWR just showed other guys that they could do it as well. And soon that technology became available, so we used to broadcast every day. There was also a loophole in the law as well. Shaheen Ariefdien OK, that’s what I wanted to find out, how could you go and… Tim Westwood I mean, it’s illegal now and they’d be shutting you down. Some people have been sent to prison and there’s a lot of fines, but it still thrives. Mostly they just take the transmitters off the roof and it’s a go. Sometimes they bust the studios, but they rarely bust the DJs. But in the era of LWR… Shaheen Ariefdien And we’re talking about what year? Tim Westwood It must be like ’83, around that era. In the era of LWR, there was this loophole in the law, that if you broadcast from private property, the police couldn’t bust you. Some guy researched this and found this out. And as a result, everyone was broadcasting from their crib and nobody was getting raided. So we were legal stations for like two years. Shaheen Ariefdien And then they changed the law? Tim Westwood Then they changed the law. Shaheen Ariefdien How instrumental were pirate radio stations in getting music out there? Or was that kind of music available in stores, in shops, did you have artists at that time - I’m talking about the real early ‘80s - perform in the UK, or was it the other way around? Tim Westwood What used to happen is, the records would come in to the specialist stores, certain stores were known for hip-hop, and on the pirates it would be mostly club DJs. So what guys would be doing in the clubs and the parties would be what they’d be doing on the radio. But there wasn’t much hip-hop in those days. I used to do like a drive time show on pirate, Monday to Friday, four till six, and we used to broadcast from North Peckham estate, which like was a notorious estate in South London. Shaheen Ariefdien From your experience, warming up for some of the big DJs or playing the odd hours, what was the value in that for you that you got out of that? Tim Westwood I mean, to be honest, this place is not full of established DJs yet, so I am sure that you all have to play your position over the time. I think being a warm-up DJ is a tremendous skill and I think it’s very important to play your position. Some days you have to play the back, you know? If I bring over Funk Flex to the UK to DJ for me, or other DJs, like Cipha Sounds or Max Glazer and I’ll start the session, I ain’t gonna crush those DJs and play all their hits and play records which are prime time at ten in the evening. Those are like main set records, let the main DJ do them at one o’clock or whatever. So I think, it’s important, if you are warming up, that you play your position right. Shaheen Ariefdien And to know your place. Tim Westwood Exactly! I’m real busy as a DJ back home and we work, we’re out there grinding real hard and I always travel with my own DJs. I’ve got my own DJ crew and they always open up for us, but we always leave time afterwards for the local guy to get on and shine. And that’s important because I learn a lot about what records he is playing and what he is doing in his part of town. And he’ll help me understand how people are getting down in Manchester or Birmingham or Glasgow or Edinburgh or wherever. You know, when I was up in Carfax, my man Dre he opened up for us, just to, that I could do me and wouldn’t be undermined in what I had to do. And then afterwards, you know, the local DJs from Jo’burg they played from two to six and I was really impressed with them. Audience Member You were saying that all that music was so important to you when you were getting into it and you see these kids, who are 17 to 19 and Biggie and 2Pac is their old-school. Don’t you want to just grab them and play them a Slick Rick record and say, “Yo, check this out?!” Tim Westwood I don’t, man. Because that’s not part of their era, that’s not part of their lives. You know it’s a whole new game now, it’s a whole new generation. It’s MTV. It’s changed, man. It’s moved on, and as much I’ve got my memories and that music means so much to me and the people I was with at that time, I just keep it moving, man. And that’s how I kept hot, you know? I’ve been in the game all of my life, like 20 years man, and if I got stuck in one era, I wouldn’t be here now. I was with Russell Simmons the other day and we were talking about this is being a beautiful journey, this hip-hop game, a beautiful experience, a beautiful journey in life. I met him on the second hip-hop record. That was the first hip-hop record, the second was Kurtis Blow’s “Christmas Rapping.” That’s when I was out there as a club DJ, a pirate DJ. I met him and I’ve known him since then. Now he is a billionaire, he’s got swans in his garden and he’s on some other stuff. It’s an incredible journey, this hip-hop game. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I just feel as a DJ, you reflect what’s going on and that means to me, we are the forefront of this game. We helped make 50 Cent enormous, we helped make Eminem enormous, but we recognize that as heat and may that work. Shaheen Ariefdien How do you balance moving with the times with something that you mentioned earlier on about responsibility towards the crowd and understanding the history of where this music comes from as well? How do you balance that? Tim Westwood I don’t think that’s a balancing act. I think you have to realise, now and today we are in the hip-hop generation. This is the hip-hop generation we’re in now and this is where we come from, but I’m dealing where we are at now. I feel back home young people have grown up in this hip-hop game from their first experience to music to now and that’s why hip-hop is so powerful, and that’s why it won’t go away. A lot of record companies talk about this being like a rap era for the next five years. This is no rap era; those are the same people who said this hip-hop game would never fucking last. Come on man, it’s the biggest form of music, the biggest artists, a multi-billion industry and it’s a beautiful thing. Audience Member You are saying you move with the times and you move with the music, do you still like the music that you are playing? Tim Westwood I have a passion for this game, I love the game. I love the music, shit excites me. Now, hearing a new 50 Cent track, which is hot, excites me. Or a Dipset track excites me just as much as the passion I had for “Rapper’s Delight.” No question of that. Plus I enjoy the game, plus I’ve learned how to handle business. Let me just tell you about the business side of things. I’ve learned from a lot of artists. The artists come in the show and we really talk. My Friday show is only two hours long and when 50 Cent came in, he talked for two hours, I think we played two records. When Jay-Z comes in... I really want to learn from these guys. Jay-Z says he is 50% an artist and 50% a businessman. On his new album, he talks about his old concept that was his marketing plan. 50 Cent describes himself as a marketing genius before he talks about him being an artist. You’ve got to understand the business to make it work for you. Don’t get me wrong, you got to have the talent and the passion, but that’s only half of the game. It’s understanding the business. I learned the business early from working with people like Marley Marl, you know, the hottest DJ of that era on WBLS. I learned from those artists of that era and I’ve been learning ever since. People like LL Cool J, who is a close friend, he’s come around my crib, sat down with me and schooled me. Chuck D talked to me, he’s been to my crib, talked to me. Flex, I’m real close to Funkmaster Flex, who is the greatest DJ, in my opinion, in the world. He elevated this DJ game beyond your wildest dreams – he is bigger than artists. You know what I mean? You got to be able to understand the business. In those early days when we were just happy to get on the set and do me and spin, man, I wouldn’t have survived all this years in this game. I wouldn’t been #1 for a minute in the UK, I wouldn’t be #1 for a minute. Realness is with this as well, man. I had to fight for everything I got, I haven’t really been given a lot. I’ve been a bit like a lone soldier in the early days. Now I’ve got a whole family around me. Shaheen Ariefdien You moved from pirate to, I guess, mainstream radio. Obviously, on pirate stations you could play whatever the hell you wanted to. What happened on mainstream? Did you decide what you wanted to play? Tim Westwood Yeah, that’s always been the given for me. Even though I was mad at the time, just being on the radio for 15 minutes, when I used to do a daytime, drive time show on the pirates. I was only on 15 minutes at three in the morning, at least I made all of my mistakes in the middle of the night. And so by time I got my main slots, by the time I moved to Radio 1, I really made all of my mistakes, really. I mean, I still get into trouble, I still fuck up a lot, but a lot of those dumb mistakes I made early in the game. I made those on pirate radio. Shaheen Ariefdien Do you have any formal training? Tim Westwood No, you just teach yourself and then when you get together with people like Marley Marl, you know, I was always very keen on listening to New York radio, seeing how they got down. I think New York hip-hop DJs, or American DJs in hip-hop are some of the best in the world without a doubt. Audience Member I’m really curious to know, what you might feel is the new business model in this new day and age, as far as music distribution. Especially, for a lot of these underground cats because we have a lot of resources at our fingertips, digital formats and also the ability to burn CDs really quickly, etc. I’m going to be asking a lot of the people who come up, what their take on the new way of music distribution might be or what you just see as a good way for artists to be putting music out. Tim Westwood That’s a really good question. Because I’m not on this side of the business, I’ve deliberately kept away from being a record company or be involved in a record company, because I wanted to be able to do what I need to do, I’m not the person to ask. But there is a revolution definitely about to happen. There is definitely a great time to be an independent. Now that are only three major record companies in the world, it is four, but I think it’s about to be three. I think there is gonna be a real revolution about to happen. But I think the revolution, which has happened already in the past, has been the joint venture. To me the revolution of hip-hop has been the empowerment and getting people rich from the ghetto. People have come from the street and now own multi-million dollar businesses and companies. Like Jay-Z hustling on the corner, owning Roc-A-Fella worth a hundred million, owning Roc-A-Wear, which is two hundred million as a joint venture. I think that’s been the power of hip-hop and that’s the thing I’m loving. I really, really respect him. So, I think the existing business model is the joint venture, where you have 50% off. I think where it’s about to go, I don’t know, but as you say, this bootlegging thing is definitely crazy out there. I love that, if anyone ever bootlegs off my radio show, that’s good for them. I’ve been in parties where I played something that night and then I’m at a party later that night and that DJ would be playing that off a burned CD and I think that’s a great thing for you to use. Shaheen Ariefdien You also got involved with production in some point. Tim Westwood Yeah, you know, when we were first in the game and UK rap was starting to really jump off the first time around with the likes of Cookie Crew and Hi-Jack and groups like that. We produced some records ourselves. We produced the London Posse, they had their moment out there, that era we did a record called “Money Mad,” which... Shaheen Ariefdien Which incidentally was big in Cape Town… Tim Westwood That’s great to hear, great to hear, man. The thing with London posse, they were rhyming in a UK accent as opposed to an American accent, which was really happening at that time. They were also talking in UK slang about a UK experience, so it’s great that this record came out here. We did Monie Love’s first record, she was from the UK, and we did General Levy, which was like the ragga element on hip-hop. And that was a label called Justice and we did that for a while, but then I just found it too hard, to be honest. Also it put me on the wrong side of the fence in my opinion because I wasn’t used to dealing with artists like that. I wasn’t used to having that type of relationship; I didn’t want to feel compromised. Like “Money Mad,” I never played on the radio once, but it was such a big record on the streets, but I thought people would say… You know, so it just wasn’t where I wanted to be. Plus it was real hard work, plus UK rap never really jumped off either. One of the things I would say about Justice, that was my company – a record label – and then Justice became my company now, Justice Entertainment. I do my radio show as an independent production company and I don’t know if that’s an option for you guys who are into radio. I work for Radio 1, but they pay me a production fee to deliver the radio, so I hire the studios, I hire my own team of people I work with – producers, broadcast assistants. So that is definitely one option to look at. As opposed to working for the station directly, I work there as an independent production company and that gives you a lot more control over your show and what you’re trying to do. Another thing I’ve done, and has been very important to me, is that I have got my own street team. A street team is a concept which is well established in New York and it’s also established back home now. That street team promotes all my own parties for me and promotes the radio show and promotes the album. I find that has been very important because I think especially when you’ve been successful in this game, you have a duty to give back. I think artists definitely have that and I think also DJs, who’ve made money out of the game. That’s one way of introducing people into the business. We recruit the street team literally off the radio, from the streets, from the clubs. I’ve had people on my street team, one of my street team got a job as head of marketing at Def Jam, they got jobs at 1Xtra, and it’s from there I find the DJs who work with me. One day – I’m not gonna do this for ever, unfortunately – so one day I hope that my production company will still have the shows on Radio 1 and a hot DJ who I can nurture and bring up in the game through my street team, through my company Justice Entertainment, get them put on as well. So I’d really recommend that. And also we do a lot of parties, we get booked for a lot of parties and we earn good money out of that. But all the parties I do myself, we don’t look to earn money out of those. We have real mad cheap admission prices, we normally let the ladies in for free and that’s illegal back home and we’ve been in trouble over it a few times, but I don’t care about that. Shaheen Ariefdien Why is that? Tim Westwood It’s equal opportunities, it’s discrimination against men apparently. But this is just how it goes. But with me I’ve got to have women at the party, otherwise it would just be such a male-dominated thing. At those parties I look to break even or I don’t care if I lose money on that. What you got to understand about that is that if I got a party in London, Birmingham, Bristol or Manchester, which I promote myself that enables me to have a street team that can work that, make that happen and it also enables me to have like 30,000 leaflets out there with my name on it, my show times and it just keeps you hot in the street. Nowadays, if you want to be successful on the radio, you got to be hot in the street. If you want to be successful as a club DJ, you got to be on the radio. Nowadays it’s such a competitive market for DJing, you can’t just… In the days of Kid Capri running New York… You got to be a Flex, you gotta be on the radio, you gotta be doing mixtapes, you gotta be doing everything, you gotta be doing work hard at this game. And not all of it makes money, man. You use the money that you earned from elsewhere to subsidise other things that you need to do. So like my parties always break even or lose money, ain’t no thing. Shaheen Ariefdien Do you do mixtapes? Tim Westwood Yeah, we do street mixtapes, which we give away and then I put these compilations out. And these are TV advertised albums I do with Def Jam. The whole compilation market is a big thing back home. This is like 50 of the hottest joints on the street that you put together. There is quite a lot of politics in licensing those because other labels are doing there own compilations, so it’s all about trading tracks to get certain tracks. But because it’s with Def Jam, I can get a lot, plus I can call personal favors to get tracks as well. Plus, I can put UK and reggae on there, which are part of that whole major record company business. This has been out for three weeks, it debuted at #1 in the compilation charts, in two weeks time we gonna hit the gift market. These shits goes platinum. This is all part of promoting hip-hop and also promoting what I do. Audience Member Just a bit of history... Where does Coldcut and Roots Manuva and DC Recordings and that come into that whole UK hip-hop scene? Tim Westwood I think Roots Manuva had one of the greatest, if not the greatest UK rap record of all time and that was Witness. That was a truly tremendous record. But what I will say, and I said this to him, is like, he is so lazy, man. I see him around – not at the parties – but more at these, like some industry stuff. And where is the follow-up to that, where is the next record? If you are an artist, it’s like you’re a crack dealer. People come to you when you got the product. As soon as the product runs out, they will go to the next crack dealer and they’ll forget about you. It’s like you got to keep on beating people in the head. Look at 50 Cent, he was dropping mad freestyles, he gave away like two albums for free, before he dropped his album. And then he’s brought out G-Unit, he ain’t stopping. With Roots [Manuva], the greatest artist out there, what has he done in the last two years? Do you know what I mean? You got to be out there. It’s like as a DJ, if you are not doing the parties… People that are coming to your parties, as soon as you stop, they are going somewhere else. People ain’t stop going out if there is places to go. You just gotta be out there working. As I say, it’s like selling crack, man. You gotta have the product, you gotta keep putting it out there without a doubt. As for Coldcut, I don’t even know where they’re at, but when I was in Spats, starting out in those early days, he used to come there with this crazy sunglasses on and this mad cloak and he had some mad MC name and he came from those days, so I respect him. I respect Coldcut a lot. Shaheen Ariefdien Also, they did the brilliant remix of “Paid in Full” – actually better than the original. Audience Member You said, you felt you weren’t responsible for teaching people about the history of music. And I used to work on BBC Radio 1 on a specialist show with Gilles Peterson and the ethos of that program was very much that he told people about where the music comes from. People can always listen to current music and appreciate it, but they never really going to appreciate it, unless they know the history. So, who in the UK is supposed to do that part of what I would see as your job? Tim Westwood I don’t see that as my job. I don’t know who’s telling me that’s my job either. I’m there for the audience, man. I’m really there for the people who love this music, wanna come to the parties, want to get their enjoyment from hip-hop. I’m there for them, I’m there to promote the scene, I make it as big as it can be. I’ve been there when it was twenty people at a Saturday lunchtime club called Spats, I’ve done all that small stuff. I want it to be big now and I’m catering for that. I don’t see that I have to be the teacher in this game, I don’t see that. Hip-hop has so many different styles and dimensions, if you want to research that and find that, that’s there for you in the UK and it’s especially there in London if you want to find it. There is the b-boy championships, there’s so many graffiti hall of fames that you can go to and be a part of that scene. But I don’t feel, for the young people that come to my parties, I should be saying, “Yo, this is our hip-hop and how it’s got to be because I’m from this generation.” I just feel like people have a right coming out and enjoy partying and be young and enjoy hip-hop. Hear a hot radio show, hear their favorite artists on the radio. If these old-school artists want to come to town, I would love to have them on the radio. But I’m not gonna force like, you know, what I know down onto them. I feel that would be an arrogant attitude. Audience Member I didn’t mean it in that way. Tim Westwood No, but that’s my perspective of me, having to do that. Audience Member In most genres, young people who really aspire to somebody who has experience like yourself. And generally, even with myself working with Gilles for a couple of years, I aspired to him because he was willing to share all of his experience and knowledge and he has been someone who is really taught other people how they can participate within the scene. That’s what I meant by that. Tim Westwood Sorry, I misunderstood you. But with that, that’s the role of my street team, that’s the role of my street team. If you want to get into the game, that’s definitely a way in. I have street teams all over the country. Be there and I’ll be showing you the business. I’m not married, I don’t have children, my whole focus is my work, hip-hop is my whole life. Sometimes I look at my street team like they’re my children. It’s not like I treat them as my children, but I’m nurturing them passing on my experience of this business and the lessons that I’ve learned to them. As I say, some of those cats have done really well for themselves. Some of them haven’t. Some of them are people who’ve never had a job, so they don’t understand the discipline and the responsibilities of work. But we also try and teach that as well through the street team, we’re pretty disciplined out there and that’s hard work as well. Shaheen Ariefdien Are there any alternatives for people to tune in to the earlier stuff in the UK, if they wanted to listen to, let’s say the Peter Pipers, and stuff like that? Tim Westwood Yeah, I mean there are DJs who do that for sure, definitely. And there is like Itch FM that’s a pirate that does good work, but it’s not out there strong. Audience Member It’s sort of hard to really gauge what your role and responsibility might be. You say, you have just the responsibility to do what’s hot, right? But then, it gets into a sort of a circular game in which you have the ability to influence change, but you also feel like you need to be playing what the audience likes. But the audience likes… Tim Westwood No, let me be really specific. There is a lot of stuff that we have broken back home. You know, we broke 50 Cent. I ain’t gonna front about that, we are really were instrumental and making that happen back home. We broke Eminem and were instrumental and we’ve done that with UK artists and we’ve done that with a lot of different artists up there. It’s not just like, oh, 50 Cent is real popping, now we gonna jump on it. We’ve been instrumental in making that happen. Audience Member No doubt and I believe… Tim Westwood And the show, and I wanna be mad real with you, what we do is mad cutting edge for the UK. We aren’t a self-perpetuating circle of… You know, we play what’s hot and what’s hot is on the radio and that makes it hot amongst the audience and then we play that again. I’m not a daytime radio DJ. Audience Member And I don’t particularly believe that that’s what you’re about. I’m just saying, that the question seem to be leading in that direction, but I feel personally, that what you’re doing is also just a product of what you believe is right, and what you think is proper. Tim Westwood To be honest, I can’t do anything more than that, what I believe. Audience Member Understood. Which also brings me back to that other question that I had, of the new formats and how people bring their music out. My personal belief is that it’s the responsibility of the artists is to be on top of their game. Because everything is in a constant change, a constant flux and therefore it’s not your responsibility per se, to be that person. It’s the artist’s responsibility to be that 50% of getting their stuff out there, to interject into what’s going on and I believe that perhaps maybe you might be able to be pushing these guys, if these people are coming to you. I mean, who is the newest artist that you are breaking? What’s the cutting edge right now for the UK as you see it? Tim Westwood I would say Lil Jon is real hot right now and we really supporting Lil’ Jon and the Dirty South sound and we try to make that happen back home. We’re definitely supporting all the dancehall movement, which is happening to make that as big as we can. The artists that we be loving at the moment, D-Block, Dipset, we’re riding with those as well. I am a DJ, I’m in the entertainment business, this is what I does, man. The position I play, going out to the mad amount of people that are listening to us and the parties that we do. This is how I define myself, this is what I do. I feel it would be arrogant of me to start saying, “I need to take control over the scene and school it in the old school or teach this or teach that.” I don’t see that role, I don’t see that role at all. And I don’t think I would have survived in this game for so long... If I wasn’t getting the figures that I get on Radio 1, I wouldn’t be on Radio 1. I ain’t on a ten-year contract. You know what I’m saying? If my parties weren’t full, if I weren’t hitting out there, if the compilations weren’t selling what they sell, I wouldn’t have this deal, you know what I mean? I just feel I’ve done hip-hop when it was small and I’ve done hip-hop when it was broke and I did that for many, many years. I think the empowerment of hip-hop now is a beautiful thing. People getting rich out of it – I’m not talking about myself – but how big it is now. All we need now is the UK artists to step up back home. That’s all we need now back home. And we need the UK to support it as well because UK artists are not supported by the local scene. If I’m at a party, if Westwood is there and there are twenty UK artists performing at another party, you know, that party ain’t gonna be full, man. In fact it might even be empty. Shaheen Ariefdien Do you have UK hip-hop artists performing at some of your parties? Tim Westwood Yeah, without a doubt, but we tend to do more things like open-mic sessions and shit like that. Audience Member You don’t think it’s a dangerous move that small radio stations and the small record labels to look after the big market and see now what’s hot, or what’s selling and think, “We have to do this as well because otherwise nobody will listen to our station?” And then they would not give space to people, who would send in tapes which are maybe not even released. Just like stations who would have no commercial sound. They wouldn’t care about who is putting commercials into their show, but they play maybe for 60% the same stuff than the big stations play. You don’t think it’s dangerous a little bit to level it up to…? Tim Westwood I can’t really talk about other radio stations because… Audience Member I mean, it’s happening, right? That the small stations look what the big stations play and then they do it as well because they want to have listeners. Tim Westwood No, the way I would see that, the pirate stations back home ain’t gonna play the same music that Radio 1 is playing, because Radio 1 is playing that music. Audience Member Is this good? Tim Westwood You know, I gonna be straight up with that, I think that the pirates are so important. We got a station named 1Xtra, my man J Da Flex is up here tomorrow talking, he’s on that. They don’t play what the mainstream play. They are playing what they believe in. And I think it’s a great time to be independent out there, because if you’re with a major, you need a million-dollar video, you need a million-dollar marketing budget and all of that. An independent can just put out records and make it happen. Audience Member The business that you spoke of – from what I understood – was strictly major marketing business. I’m on both sides. I produce major artists that you probably play as well as independent, more creative-control-things as well and I’m not hating on either side. I just want to get it a little bit more clear for the guys that are here because most of the people that are here may not look to that as a venue. Because these are people who, I think, probably are more independently writing their things or maybe looking to distribute as well. And I think a lot of things what I took from what you were saying were strictly major situations, like breaking Eminem and 50 Cent and those things. I think you don’t break an artist like that, that’s million dollar marketing things that are going to work regardless of what DJ plays it. Tim Westwood I totally agree with you, that shit was gonna happen. When I was saying that maybe I should like put it in a different way. Say, with Eminem, I knew Paul Rosenberg, his manager, who represented another artist Milo, who I know well. I got Eminem’s “My Name Is” like a year early before he had the deal, before he got with Dr. Dre and all of that and I was playing that every week, making that real hot. So when he came, he was really set up. With 50, I was riding with him on all those bootleg freestyles that he was putting out, all the shit with the mixtapes. So we were playing 50 when cats back home was not feeling him. We were supporting that from day one, so we was on that mad early. That’s what I mean. Without a doubt, those artists would have happened irrespective of my role in that game. We were just on those mad early. Talking about major marketing, I would say what we do… I’m not a radio station, I’m just a DJ who plays like five hours over the weekend, that’s all I do. Audience Member But you have the power… Tim Westwood Well, I don’t see it’s power, I’m just a DJ doing me. But what I’m trying to say about the marketing aspect, my street team, that is the mad hand-to-hand street marketing. Leaving flyers at the local nail shop, barber shop, food takeaway, whatever. That’s what that is and my parties are, you know, if we’d showed the tape more you’d see what my parties are about. That street marketing and the street team activity is exactly what it is. It’s nothing to do with the majors, that’s just how we make ourselves hot on the street. We support that heavily. We use that only to promote this, which is a TV advertised album, but if we would to use that to support a local artist, we would help them as well to get their an awareness out on the street. This isn’t some major thing, I ain’t hooked into the majors, I don’t work for any of the record companies, I ain’t no consultant or any of that bullshit. I always said no to that money. Audience Member I just wanted to make the comment that I think, that a lot of the things in that business equates to money and has nothing to do with music. Which is where I think my problem lies with a lot of the ethics of maybe your street team. You say you have a street team and a lot of those guys go to other labels… Tim Westwood No, not my guys, we don’t work for the labels. Audience Member Not the labels, I mean you said they acquired other jobs at other businesses… Tim Westwood Oh yeah, they moved on in their career. Audience Member If you have ten people that work and they’re all listening to only popular music and they’re going to other businesses that expand in what they do, then you have ten other situations, that do the same thing that you are doing. Where is the voice for the people who don’t have that? I think there is a responsibility for that. Tim Westwood Yeah, and back home there is a lot of DJs, a lot of radio shows, a lot of pirate stations who cater for all of that.

Vince Degiorgio
Vince Degiorgio may have been around the music industry for as long as most of us can remember, but he still talks tunes with the infectious zeal of a kid in a record store. A disco DJ in Toronto clubs during the heyday of the genre in the ’70s, he spent his days spinning vinyl, working in a record store and gathering the skills which would later make him a hitmaker, songwriter, A&R guru and music publisher. The corporate years of his career included stints at BMG in Canada and RCA in America, where he signed NSYNC.
In this lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, the Canadian all-rounder used records to retrace his steps from the racks of the record shops to recording studios and court rooms, in the process imparting on the audience a short history of North American disco and some useful advice.
Hosted by Gerd Janson So when one looks at your biography it is really difficult where to pick a
point where to start. It is like almost the history of dance music in the last
– where are we, 2007? – in the last more than 30 years. Maybe you could just
start at the start? Vince DeGiorgio OK. In the beginning, actually I started DJing when I was 13 years old and my
mixer had no headphone jack, no controls. You had two RTA jacks in the back
and if you wanted to try mixing, you’d put your head down near the turntable
and you’d try and hear where the breaks were. Which actually served me very
well later in my career because you’d be talking to someone in your booth and
you’d lose your place and you’d know exactly where the break was so you could
just mix right into it. I started working in record retail around the same
time. My father had an incredible record collection so all the inspiration I
have being in the business comes from him. Gerd Janson What kind of stuff was in your father’s collection? Vince DeGiorgio Oh, you name it. Everything, including opera. I can remember “Love in C-Minor”
by Cerrone coming out, “Love To Love You Baby,” and obviously those records
were pretty edgy in their time, and him defending my taste in music against my
sisters who just weren’t into it at all. There’s everything in his collection
from Nat King Cole to Johnny Mathis to the USA/European connection, Cerrone,
Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, you name it, it’s in there. Actually, this
morning I was missing something and I called him, he’s looking for it, he
probably has it. Gerd Janson So your father is still into music and buying stuff? Vince DeGiorgio Yes, and as we go through today’s conversation, I travel a lot, I’ve been on
the road for five months this year and I never leave home without a list of
things he’s still looking for. You know, 30,000 records later, I’m still out there
looking for things for him and looking for things for myself. Gerd Janson Let’s get back to where it started. You grew up in Toronto, right? Vince DeGiorgio I actually grew up in Brampton, which is a suburb about 25 kilometers outside
here and I realized pretty young I just wanted to be a DJ. I was a pretty
shy kid and I felt it was a great way to not only share my love for music, but
to also get into working. You know, working in the club world where there was so
much excitement going on because it’s the middle of the ’70s and everything
was in this evolutionary stage almost as it is right now. Gerd Janson Do you remember the first time you set foot in a club? Vince DeGiorgio Yes. I went to a club in Toronto and I was 17 years old. The legal age was 21
at the time and I remember I went to the Katuba disco, which is at Eglinton
and Mount Pleasant, which is just about 15 minutes’ drive from here, in a hotel
because at that time hotel discos were all the rage. And I managed to sneak in
and I met the DJ at a store and I went inside and the first record I danced to
was “From East To West” by Voyage and the girl I danced with ended up being
the lead singer of Tapps, which is a group I ended up developing ten years
later. Gerd Janson And Voyage was a French group, right? Vince DeGiorgio Yes, it was produced by a guy named Roger Tokarz, who is the pre-eminent
disco/house producer in probably most of Europe, and he used some of the
greatest session musicians in France, like Slim Pezin and Marc Chantereau and
Alain Dahan. And they went on an incredible string of records, first doing
“From East to West” with the Cerrone trio of Sue Glover, Sunny Leslie and Kay
Garner doing vocals and then they discovered a 19 year old girl named Sylvia Mason-James from England, who ended up singing on “Souvenirs” and “Let’s Fly Away” and subsequently did a solo album with them on Carrere in France. Gerd Janson: Could you describe the setting in a disco back then a bit? You just mentioned
that you were dancing with a girl, so people actually danced with each other
back then? Vince DeGiorgio Yeah, I mean, I was probably the worst hustle dancer in the history of modern
mankind, which is probably one of the reasons I was drawn to the after-hours
clubs where you didn’t have to dance with anybody. You just got on the floor,
threw your hands in the air and went crazy. But there was a lot of people
practicing moves that they saw on television. There was disco television shows
on NBC and CTV and they would read magazines, for example. It was very
glittery. You’d have track lighting that would basically just blink on and
off. It was wonderful and it was kitschy and today it would be incredibly
cheesy. But I think if we were all there today, we would probably be up and
dancing as well. Gerd Janson And it was all still pre-John Travolta, right? Vince DeGiorgio Yeah, thank God. Saturday Night Fever was a blessing and a curse in many
ways. It really doesn’t tell the true story of it from everyone’s perspective
and the disco scene wasn’t one sector of people in those days. Our disco
composition was comprised of Italians, Greeks, people of color, people who
did everything but listen to rock & roll. Lucy Martin of Chic, who sang so
many great records with them, was quoted once as saying, “Disco has no
color!” And in Toronto, having over 150 different nationalities living in it, it was absolutely true at that time. It didn’t matter who you were or where you were from. If you got in you owned the world and I think that’s what drew me to it. Gerd Janson And how hard was it to get in? Vince DeGiorgio It’s funny. I guess it was difficult in some ways, but there’s the running
joke that in Los Angeles, if you put a velvet rope in front of a sewer, people
will spend $25 to walk over it. But I think back in those days it wasn’t super
difficult until the boom really hit. At that time it was just a place to go
and listen to music and go dancing and buy a couple of drinks and hope you
meet somebody. I think the getting into the clubs wasn’t really that difficult
until the clubs reached a certain level, where they made you wait and they
picked and choosed. But the velvet rope thing wasn’t really crazy in ’76 or ’77. Gerd Janson And what were the great clubs in Toronto then? You mentioned hotel discos, were they any different to normal discos? Vince DeGiorgio: Well, yeah because I think back then clubs were open from 9 PM until 1 AM. Toronto has always had this medieval problem of how long they are allowing people to drink. Gerd Janson They extended it to 2 o’clock. Vince DeGiorgio It’s a miracle or something. But I didn’t think I could express myself in
those clubs so I always withdrew myself to the after-hours clubs. The big
clubs in the day, the big disco bars, were like Hotspurs, which was the first
club to have a live-to-air broadcast on a radio station, which was really huge
here. It wasn’t like Montreal where it’s been a tradition since the mid-’70s. The Hippopotamus club, Rooney’s. Actually, Rooney’s was the place that had the
live-to-air, the Port of Call, which is a place that I ended up working in, or
just called “the Port,” and they had Scandals downstairs so you did your
apprenticeship downstairs before you got to the big room upstairs. But there
were a number of amazing gay clubs that really started things, like the Quest
and the 511 and Steps and Stages. Stages was probably the granddaddy of them
all when it was at its peak. There are so many of them that are innumerable to
mention but that’s a big part of that time. Gerd Janson And you mention Montreal, so were there local differences between Toronto and Montreal? Vince DeGiorgio Oh, completely. The Montreal DJs in my opinion are probably the greatest that
ever played. Guys like Robert Ouimet and George Cucuzzella from Unidisc, who
was actually the first DJ at the Lime Light, and you could almost say that
George was probably one of the first real superstar DJs. Gerd Janson The Lime Light was a club in Montreal. Vince DeGiorgio Yes, it was. The Lime Light and the 12:34, and when the Toronto DJs could get a
day off because there wasn’t any of this residency stuff back then. Basically
you worked six nights a week and if you missed a day, if it was a Tuesday you
might come back and you’d been fired. It’s not about doing a seven-hour
extended set like I’m seeing Danny Howells do, coming over from England, it
was more about I had to do that every night. So the guys in Montreal,
musically, I think the best word would be they had a certain continentalism,
they had a certain je ne sais qua about the way they played their music. It
was really different. And their mixing style, I’ve always said a bar DJ
playing from nine to one out in a place way out in the suburbs was probably
three times better than a DJ who was getting all the press in the US or
internationally because they had incredible technique and a wonderful flair
for their music and they drowned in it, they loved it in a way I have never seen. Gerd Janson Not even in New York? Vince DeGiorgio No. I think the great New York DJs, the really great ones, you can probably
name and I just don’t think it’s all about one city. This was a party that everyone
was invited to. And having to live, especially in Canada because you have a 900-pound gorilla with America being so much bigger right next to you, we just had
a different perspective of it and we were feeding that market like crazy
because some of the music coming through Canada was very difficult to get in the States unless they imported it from us. Gerd Janson So how would you describe that different perspective then compared to New York
on a music point of view? Vince DeGiorgio I think that the American DJs, a lot of them in the beginning were playing a
lot of records that were made in the USA. And to spice up their programs they
wanted to get different things, like “Soul Makossa” by Manu Dibango in the
early ’70s was one of the first imports to come from France. Also, “Jungle
Fever” by the Chakachas and this one goes back to 1971, ’72 and ’73. But we
had things that were causing nightmares for record labels, things like Crystal
Grass and “Le Souffle Du Vent,” crazy obscure singles that would never be
released in America because they could never get radio play. But in Canada, we
were a lot smaller so we were able to end up feeding them a lot of things from
South Africa and from Italy and from France and from Canada, of course. And we
Canadians helped make it a global business because we weren’t only feeding
them international music they couldn’t acquire, we were also feeding them
Canadian music that changed the landscape. It didn’t feel boring. And if they
released our records or the international records, if they picked them up,
they’d also remix them because a big problem back then was the import. If a
lot of the DJs are playing the import, you have to give them a reason to keep
playing it. Like “Moon-Boots,” we were just playing a little bit earlier, when it came
out as a 45 on Ariola, everyone was playing the 45, but when Tom Moulton remixed it –
Tom Moulton, the greatest remixer of all time – he is a person who just loved
music so much that when he remixed things was reinventing things, and that’s
what you had to do back then. You couldn’t be boring back then because there
was someone else out there staring at you trying to take your job. If you’re a DJ that’s
for sure. Gerd Janson Maybe we could have a listen to some of the Canadian stuff? Vince DeGiorgio I’m going to play a little piece of the first 12" single that I ever bought, which is called “Fighting on the Side of Love.” This record was one of the few that combined people in Toronto and people in Montreal working together. Ian Guenther and Willie Morrison were two Toronto based producers who ended up
producing Grand Tour, Sticky Fingers and THP Orchestra. This THP Orchestra
record was actually the first one that they did and I sold a collection of
baseball cards to become a DJ to afford to buy records. So this was the first
12" I bought, this is called “Fighting on the Side of Love” and they are
accompanied, I think, by Michel Dayge and Dominic Secente of Montreal who
ended up producing Alma Fay Brooks. (music: THP Orchestra – “Fighting on the Side of Love” / applause) It’s funny when I listen back to this because I also keep remembering how
difficult it was to mix in and out of. But the great thing about it is that
every music business has a beginning and he had a much bigger hit with a song called “Something’s Up” as well, and some of the records that ended up getting made by
that production team are legendary and have been sampled over and over as
well. Gerd Janson Maybe in comparison to that we could listen to something by the Bombers? Vince DeGiorgio That was the beginning of your discussion of the Toronto disco style.
Montreal, as I mention, I’ve paid a lot of homage to it so far. They were
definitely ahead of us. One of the things, of course, in that period was that
a lot of songs ended up getting covered, and one of the biggest records in the
foundation of the disco movement was a song called “The Mexican” by Babe Ruth,
which was a rock band that recorded for Harvest in the early ’70s. This song
ended up getting covered by Jellybean on his EMI WotUpski! EP that he ended
up doing in the early ’80s. But long before that, Pat Deserio, who is one of
the architects of the Montreal disco scene and George Lagios as well, great
producer, did a cover version of “The Mexican” and this was mixed by Paul
Poulos who was a DJ from the US. [plays record at wrong speed] I did that on
purpose. (music: The Bombers – “The Mexican” / applause) Gerd Janson So did you know that the original by Babe Ruth was also very influential for
the – as Mr. [Jeff] Mao maybe
can testify – was also very influential in New York with the first hip-hop guys? Vince DeGiorgio It wouldn’t surprise me. Gerd Janson But it was nothing that you in Toronto or Montreal or so noticed, coming up in
New York? Vince DeGiorgio You know, it’s funny, when we would hear that information. Sometimes the fact
that it was something that was developing or evolving, the press would only
really give it to us when it hit a certain mark. The Village Voice wasn’t
exactly the easiest thing to get back in the day and Billboard, or the major
music magazines, were really covering things that were selling rather than
things that were developing. And it was probably something that The New York
Times would cover as a neighborhood story. And I did want to mention one other
thing before we move on. Back in the day there were a number of different kinds of clubs in the Toronto area. A couple of the really interesting ones like RV
had a membership plan, where I think I worked there on Mondays, even though it
was dead because I was trying to hone my skills, and a lot of us started
working at the A-level clubs on the nights when there was nobody there. And to me, the best
DJ in the world is the one who will play with the same kind of passion and
intensity on a dead night than they can on a night when the club’s full. So
whether I was working there, or in Heaven, or another of the big clubs, I
always remembered that. Gerd Janson Speaking of that, when you have this night job that was actually a day job
because you had to do it every day, how did you keep yourself motivated,
playing music every night, the same records, trying to change it, or...? How did you do that? Vince DeGiorgio I actually didn’t sleep much in those days. My thing was that I’d be there
from Tuesday to Sunday. I would have Mondays off, and I would work five days a
week at a record store, which was, say, from where these chairs are to us.
About maybe 150 square feet called Disco Sound Of Canada, which was maybe two
blocks north of us on Young Street. I got in there by accident. I had looked
for the store forever. I went and I worked there from 11 o’clock to 7
o’clock and then I would go home. I would have what I called a disco nap from
7:30 until 9, I would eat something that was really bad for me and then I
would go to work at 11 PM and I would play until 4 o’clock in the morning,
Tuesday to Thursday. And then on Saturdays until everybody left, which was
usually about 7 in the morning. Then we’d all go to Franz and have breakfast
between 7 and 9 o’clock and then we’d go home, go to sleep and I’d be up in
three hours and be back at the store. It was a life that I would never trade for
anything because at any given time anything could come in, and when the new
records came in our store was completely full. And I’m saying 25 A-level DJs
trying to get ten copies of the record. Like the day “Disco Inferno” came to
Canada and it was never anywhere and Tom Moulton actually went down to Record
Haven, which was a huge exporter in New York and put one copy on it for Peter Frost, my late colleague, and we just stood there and we didn’t know what to do.
And that happened every day. The first day that Santa Esmeralda came in, the
first day that Patrick Juvet invaded North America as an import from France,
the first day that Isaac Hayes’ “Disco Connection” came into the store, which
was a song you could re-sell to people all the time because they liked it so
much they forgot they already bought it. And the other thing about the store
that was incredible was that anybody who was anybody was calling us from all
over the world because we had what no one else could find. And we would pick up
our phone. So the mail order business was crazy and it had a dog as a mascot.
If you didn’t give something to the dog, the dog actually remembered and
snarled you out of the store. It was great to do that and you were talking to
people inside the music business and there was this cultural boom that was
going on. If you lived in an all-white neighborhood, you met someone of
color. If you’d never met anyone from a different country or you’d never met
somebody from the United States, or flew in from Amsterdam or someplace, you
met them. If you’d never met a gay person in your life, you were going to meet
them there. It was this cultural whirlpool. It was like the United Nations on a
dancefloor, only it was made of carpet. And the one thing we used to get
yelled at was trying to mix between two records because we had no cue
headphone between two turntables in the store. So we auditioned and played the
records for people and we had Lenco L75 turntables, which were motor driven.
They weren’t belt-drives so you had the actual cue and you were just nudging
it along because this thing [gesturing at the Technics turnables] was years away from coming. So I remember buying
an old Lenco L40 and I said to my dad, “Look, it’s a collector’s item,” and he
said, “It’ll be collecting dust in six months.” I don’t think I ever used it. Gerd Janson And do you remember the first day in the store when you heard something by Gino Soccio? Vince DeGiorgio I’ve got the world’s best Gino Soccio story, actually. Gino was one of those
guys, he was a huge influence on me both personally and professionally and
the first time I met him was at an Ontario disco pool meeting. The disco pools
were a place where all the DJs were members of and they all used to congregate
and we all used to go there and we would pay a membership fee and we would get
some of the jewels and gems that we are playing today. And Gino kind of took
me under his wing and I’d never been to Montreal and I said, “I’d really like
to come to Montreal and see you work sometime, it’d be great.” And he goes,
“Hey, whenever you’re in town, just give me a call.” Naturally, I didn’t call
before I got there, I just went to Montreal, knocked on his door and said,
“Hey, I’m here!” He just looked and shook his head as if to say, “Who is this
screwball from Toronto showing up on my doorstep?” He couldn’t have been
nicer, he couldn’t have been a better mentor, we went out that night to a
private Montreal club with Geraldine Hunt, who wrote “Can’t Beat the Feeling.”
She’s from St. Louis originally and did some records for Roulette and moved to
Montreal with a touring band, and we partied our faces off and I think I left
at about five in the morning. Gino and I had breakfast the next morning and I
think I was bitching about some record and he looked at me and he said, “Well, what the hell have you ever done in your career?” And that was the day that my career started. Gerd Janson Do you remember the record that you were bitching about? Vince DeGiorgio It was either that or a promotion person. The great thing about being a DJ is
that you can complain about almost everything. It didn’t have to be anything
special, you just had to... Gerd Janson Complaining is part of the trade? Vince DeGiorgio Oh yeah, whining, bitching, complaining, getting upset about not getting
something first. You know, one of my former roommates, Cord McMillan, who was
a great, great DJ, played here at the Quest as one of the pre-eminent gay
clubs of the city. He was the best. He would get a record from one of the US
promotion people, he would automatically chart it at number three or number two on
his chart and he would put it in the store where I worked. So everyone was
complaining about him all the time because he was obviously posturing that “I have
it first.” But he would play the hell out of the record. He would date stamp
everything, he was very specific about this stuff. It was things like that. I
think I was complaining to Gino about not getting any respect for what I was
doing, but the great thing is that when Gino set me straight, he said, “If you
want to be a part of the business, you have to be positively passionate. You
just can’t scream your head off and bitch about the world because the truth is
that we’re all brothers and sisters.” I’m still a DJ today 35 years after I
played my first record, and he was trying to teach me that and it’s a great lesson.
And that’s why, no matter where I go, I really listen to the guy who’s
playing. And if I don’t like the music, I’ll bitch about it as I always used
to and as people used to about me. But I think the great thing is that you
learned an awful lot about yourself by discovering what other people do and I
think that’s what Gino was trying to instill in me and it worked. Gerd Janson Before we hear what Gino’s comments led you to, maybe we hear a little bit of
Gino’s stuff just to give people an idea. Vince DeGiorgio This is actually a sin, I actually have the 12" of “Dancer” in the wrong
sleeve. You knew that someone was in your DJ booth when you worked five or six
days a week because you’re like, “I didn’t leave that there, that’s not my
thumb print.” (music: Gino Soccio – “Dancer” / applause) Gerd Janson It’s different to the THP record, right? Vince DeGiorgio I remember when I visited Gino at that time, he had a box that was kind of like some
kind of historic sequencer and he was very much into developing new sounds and
doing a lot of experimentation and he had done a remarkable thing on “The
Visitors,” which is a song that was on his Outline record. And he really
continued to be a lot more on the electronic tip, where Willy and Ian were
doing a lot more orchestral-based music. And it just depended on what your
groove was. I think people took “Dancer” as kind of like a national anthem
in many ways because anybody can dance to that record. Some of the
disco that was more on the orchestral tip you would expect to dance a
different way to it than you did to this. You could just get on and move and
it didn’t matter what size you were or where you were. Gerd Janson And what kind of groove did you prefer? Vince DeGiorgio You know, I was a huge snob and the orchestral stuff that was kind of mixed
with something funky was big for me, or it was big and it was expansive and it
was orchestral and it probably came from France or from Italy. Because I grew
up on orchestral-based pop and this was just a natural extension to it and if
it was funky, like I’m the biggest Thom Bell fan in the world, he’s my
favorite producer on the soul side, as Giorgio Moroder on the
electronic or Cerrone and Costandinos is on the disco side, so for me, the bigger
it was, the more anthemic it was. And if it commanded you to listen, I was all
over it and I would play the hell out of it and I would go anywhere to find
it. I would do exactly what some of you have done by hitting the vinyl stores
each week and experience something new. But for me, if it was European, the
packaging was better, the mastering was better, it was a lot sexier to have.
You wanted to have it and you wanted to piss off your fellow DJs by having it
first and you wanted to bang it as hard as you could to make sure that they
knew that you were there first. It was a real competition. Gerd Janson I was just about to ask, the competition side of being a DJ? Vince DeGiorgio It was ruthless. It was absolutely ruthless. I actually got my big break going
from the B-clubs to the A-clubs because I had worked at Disco Sound, as I mentioned, and I was about to quit because I was going to get into the travel business. So I left and I took a job in the suburbs. I was going to go around the world once a year and, believe it or not, I was going to just retire. I
figured, “Well, you know, I’m 20, maybe I’ll do something different.” And I
quit working at Disco Sound for about three days, went home to the ’burbs, got
a little bored, went to the music store and said, “Can I have a job? This is
my experience.” They said, “OK, you’re hired.” Within three days they had
transferred me back downtown to one of the chain stores where I had to be
selling Meat Loaf and the Beatles and Styx and all these rock records along
with people looking for the Commodores and disco imports. So I basically went
back to the store, begged to get my job back and on the second day I was
there, one of the owners, there was a club chain called MoMo’s, they had a
place right at Young and Buller, and the owner of the club had what most of us
DJs would have considered the most gorgeous daughter you have ever seen in
your life – blonde, ice blue eyes, the whole thing. Everybody was in love with
her. So she came into the store to buy a record and she says, “I’m having a
birthday party, I want you to be the DJ.” And two of my closest friends were
working there and I don’t know what the hell I did because I don’t remember. All I remember was I was in a real DJ booth where you had to get steps to come
and see me and it was an institution in Toronto and apparently I just kicked
it. I was apparently amazing that night and that night I got held back by the
owner, Manny Motta, and he looked at me and said, “I want you to be our DJ
permanently here.” And I looked at him and said: “Well, I don’t even know what
kind of crowd you got,” and he said, “I don’t care.” I said, “Are you sure?”
He said, “Yeah!” So I said OK. Little did I know that two of my best friends
got fired that night because I got their jobs. And believe me, what goes
around certainly does come around in the city. And I used to visit those
people when I was a junior, learning, watching how they would play to crowds.
You can’t teach someone how to be a great DJ and you can’t teach someone to be
a mediocre DJ. It’s either in your soul, it’s in your heart and you learn to
relate to the crowd. So basically, my roommate at the time had been
recommending me to take over that job if they ever needed someone. They just
said, “This is good, he seems to have all the imports, nobody else can find
them. We don’t know how the hell he does it. You should hire him.” And I guess
the rest is history. I ended up staying there for four years and everyone was
trying to get my job. I had one guy who would literally just go in the middle
of my dancefloor and stare at me for hours. Try to unnerve me. Never took a vacation
in four years until it was time to leave. And like every other club, the
end came swiftly. But in 1984, the very last night the club was open, one of my
regulars who became the focal point of the group Tapps that I worked with in
my Power Records label, he said, “I want you to come back.” He just started
swearing his head off. He goes, “I don’t give a fuck about anything, this is
your club. Everyone else can go to hell.” And he gave me the keys and I played
the last night, and then the day after they turned it into a restaurant or a
deli or something. One DJ would go into a club, they’d be working the managers
like crazy, “I’ll do this for you, I’ll make tapes for you,” they would go and
practice their mixes like crazy and then put a tape in the guy’s pocket and
go, “I’m better than that guy you’ve got, he sucks.” And I’ll tell you
something else, the female DJs in this town, there were four or five of them
were unbelievable, and the ladies had to work twice as hard and they made
us look real bad because they were damn good. Gerd Janson You were just talking about relating to the crowds, so how did you balance the
whole DJ ego thing that goes on about, “Oh, I have all the best music in the
world,” versus what the people actually want to hear or want to dance to? Vince DeGiorgio Well, there’s two things. I’m a Leo so my ego was completely out of control.
There’s no hope there. But the bottom line is, I had one rule when I played for
a crowd: I played for the ladies. I played for the women. I couldn’t care about
the guys. The guys were coming anyway, and my job was to get the women on the
floor and to keep them happy at all costs. The reason that I say that is
because the pulse of a club in those days was based on how intense your party
was and how our crowd related to what you did. If you can’t draw the first six
to ten women... The women always came early, the guys never came early.
Remember, I didn’t start working at this peak club until 11. The first hour
was mine, 12 o’clock there were a couple of people who wanted to get in
because we only had 32 seats in the club. You could only get 500 people in it
or 400 people in it. And then we had like these things, if you can imagine
these seats here, well, imagine having them stacked like steps. That’s what we
had, and you could only get so many places to sit down and then you were done.
You were basically up all night. So my thing was, “Who do we have coming in
tonight?” And if it was 50/50 female to male, the boys would love me and they
would keep that floor going because they would be dragging the girls on the
floor all night long, and that was my job. My job was to treat the female
patrons like royalty so the guys would be happy. Because the happier they
were, the longer they’d stay. It’s a strange philosophy because people go, “I went and I EQed my sound and I readjusted the lights.” It’s like, “Hey, I had the best sound man and the best light guy in the world, he didn’t want to be a DJ.” That’s another thing, the great light man, who always somehow wanted to
be the DJ. We had to be aware of this all the time. One of the greatest light
men who ended up being a musician was Patrick Cowley. He started off being a light man in San Francisco, worked those clubs and was
a synthesizer keyboards player, so he kind of developed both things without
ever becoming a DJ. Gerd Janson But did a lot of records, right? Vince DeGiorgio Oh, yeah. The “I Feel Love” bootleg, which we bought in New York for $40 on
an acetate that you could only play like 25 times. Gerd Janson What is an acetate, for people who don’t know? Vince DeGiorgio Before a record becomes a record it used to go through three stages. Once the
mix was done it would go to this place in New York called Sunshine Sound,
which was at 1650 Broadway, one of the most famous record industry addresses
in the world. And they would get, I guess in the dub world they call them
dubplates, and you would get a 10" or a 12" cut and you could basically play
it 30 or 40 times. And you would go from an acetate, like, let’s say you’re
working in a club in New York, and this is your card from my late friend
Richie Kaczor from Studio 54, and you’re the promotion guy and get this thing
called an acetate. You go into the club and say, “Hey, how you doing? I got a new record for you, do
you want to play it?” And of course you would because you don’t want to lose
the luxury of playing something that hasn’t even been manufactured yet. And as
soon as the mix is approved and they see the reactions, then the next thing
they do is a test pressing, which is like a white label and it just has the
name of the record on it. And it’s good to go and those mixes are approved
and they manufactured it. So the acetate is kind of like the first generation
of the piece of vinyl. Gerd Janson You were talking about Patrick Cowley. Vince DeGiorgio Patrick was someone who left us way too soon and I was working for… I was not
only the first writer and the youngest writer writing for disco music or dance
music in the history of the country, I was 17-years old, I was also the first
promoter working for an American production company in a foreign territory in
the disco business. I worked for a company called 120 Dance
Promotions and TQ Fanshaw, who was a club impresario based in San Francisco.
He hired me because I was always trading imports with his key DJs. He said,
“We’ve got this record on the Fusion label that you’ve got to hear.” I go,
“What’s it called?” And he said, “I think they’re going to call it ‘Menergy.’“
I said OK, and he goes, “It’s kind of like Giorgio, but it’s cool.”
I said, “What does that mean? Giorgio’s God.” And he goes, “It’s really
different, really trippy.” And that was at a very crucial time, we’re talking
1981 where everything was changing because M came out with “Pop Music,” and
the B-52’s “Rock Lobster,” so it really was changing the disco landscape a
lot. I remember working at Le Tube and I got five copies of it, and I gave
them to my two roommates and the other key DJs in the territory, you know, you
really spoiled your friends. I remember putting this thing on for the first
time and the place just went into orbit. Patrick had a consistent way of doing
this and he had one clubgoer kept bugging him to do a record when he was
doing lights and it turned into “Right on Target” by Paul Parker, which has
been used as the basis rhythmically for “Weekend” by Dead Eye Dick, DJ Dick in
Germany. Patrick was just one of those guys who really re-invented the wheel
electronically because he was using technology and tape loops and all kinds of
really different things and he was also mixing at a huge studio. He was
working at the Automat and then he got together with
Sylvester and ended up doing “Do You Wanna Funk,” which was made for $802 and has made
about 20 million dollars in revenue and one of the greatest records ever made. Gerd Janson Sylvester was who? Vince DeGiorgio Sylvester was someone who came out of the San Francisco drag scene. He had
done records for the Blue Note label on the West Coast, and then he signed
with Fantasy Records. He was working with Harvey Fuqua, who had worked in
Motown and had produced the Jackson 5 and everything. Gladys Knight, the great
legendary R&B singer, was once told by her mother, “If you really wanna hear
someone sing falsetto with soul, enough of that garbage, listen to Sylvester.”
I saw him live three times, the best three shows I ever saw, and he was this
towering 6-foot-3 androgynous male, who was the precursor to every flamboyant
exotic insane performer, and just sang like a bird. Patrick did a lot of
records with him, played sythesizers on a lot of this stuff. And Patrick’s
partner, Marty Blackman, was part of a team called Blackman Hedges Promotions
in San Francisco and they remixed all of the Sylvester records with the
exception of “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real).” Sylvester is a benchmark.
Anyone who sings falsetto, you answer to Sylvester basically, in that era. Gerd Janson Do we have something you can play us? Vince DeGiorgio Yep. I’m going to do something I never thought I would ever do, but you know
what? Where is it? Here. It’s still sealed. There’s a great story, when
Sylvester came to do a show in Toronto, the Two Tons of Fun were with him,
Izora Armstead and Martha Wash, and one of the legendary DJs, Thom Bell, kept
trying to sell them diet powder after the show. Gerd Janson So maybe if someone doesn’t know the Two Tons of Fun? Vince DeGiorgio They were his background singers and they were huge and they ended up becoming
the Weather Girls. This is the other thing, when we bought these records we
never knew what speed they were because half the time they didn’t write
anything on them. This is “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real).” (music: Sylvester – “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)” / applause) The other thing about this record that I remembered distinctly is how many
perfect mixtapes it ruined because some of the edits in the later part of the
song just used to drive us crazy because you used to have to try and time them
to get out. This is a live drummer playing, and a great live drummer, too,
and some of the musicianship and the edits of we had to do to construct a 12"
single was completely different. But that being said, we would play Sylvester
to death. He was a non-radio voice, he was purely a disco artist for the most
part. Gerd Janson But Bronski Beat made that into a radio record later, right? Vince DeGiorgio Yeah, Bronski Beat also used one of the breaks of my songs and put it in
“Small Town Boy,” matched me beat for beat. So it’s a... Gerd Janson So it’s a touchy subject? Vince DeGiorgio No, not at all. You know what? I just don’t think anything can beat this. I
think Jimmy Somerville is a great artist and I even tried writing stuff for
him when he was signed to Sony BMG in Germany, but Sylvester is an
incomparable artist. He is one of the artists from the era you can just go back
and listen to, there is no Auto-Tune and there’s no patching. When he says,
“You make me feel mighty real,” it’s because he was. He lived out his dream and
he was a great artist. Gerd Janson You just mentioned recording back then was a different game? Vince DeGiorgio Oh, god. Well, I was laughing because I was hanging out and getting to know some of
the participants. I was there with Filipe in his room kind of constructing. We
were just jamming basically trying to get some ideas together and I realized
that all he had to do was double-click and GarageBand opens. And for me, when
I started, that would have taken six and a half hours. We were on Atari, even
before the Atari 1040ST came in. I mean, the first disco record I ever did was
a record called “Heartquake” in 1981, which I’ll post on the Academy website.
And basically, the drum was an old, old, old Roland drum machine and basically
it just went... [mimes drum beat] We timed it one measure and then we repeated
it, cut it twice, and that was the loop. So the drums didn’t change, because we were
only working on an 8-track board. And we had the drums, the bass and everything
was played live, including the percussion and the record never saw the light
of day. It was a real masterpiece. We ended up doing electronic stuff. We had the old Atari 1040ST and we started with
2MB. Then we all had emotional overload when we were able to upgrade our
system to 4MB. Amazing. We had to record each MIDI track one at a time, and
that took the syncman or the Roland SPX box to actually keep in time. I
actually want to buy a Roland SPX, just so I can get a chainsaw and cut one in
half, so I can kill one of my earliest problems. Making records back in those
days was really difficult and it was very difficult making them here. Canadians, we
live in a real folklore-rock country. A lot of the Montrealers would go down and
they would mix their records in Philadelphia and would mix their records with
great, legendary engineers like Gene Leone and Joe Tarsia at Sigma Sound. Or
they would make a record just good enough so that somebody in the US would pick
it up and want to remix it. The funny thing about it is the recording
techniques, they would mix our records like they were rock records, so things
couldn’t cut through, and that was really a huge problem. And the other thing,
too, was once you’d made what you thought was a great record, the mastering
engineers here needed an education as well because they were cutting the THP
Orchestra record the same way they would cut a children’s record or a country
record. They were cutting it for sonic fidelity. They weren’t cutting it to be
played in a club. They didn’t have the knowledge. So a lot of the early
Canadian pressings of records were nightmares for Canadian DJs because they
just couldn’t play them. Gerd Janson So you had to have them mastered in New York? Vince DeGiorgio Either that or we’d wait until the record got picked up in France or the
States or in Germany and we’d get the import and we’d play it. Because you
have to understand the mixers that we used to use, I mean, they were Ranes or
these Cerwin-Vega mixers of the past, which were great because they had a big,
booming [sound]. They were great actually until someone poured a Coca-Cola into
them, which has happened before. But they amplified the sound. I remember
having these two old Yamaha amplifiers and these things were like tanks. If I
had to play a Canadian record, I would go over to one of the amps and I would
split it and just crank one side of it up so I wouldn’t lose my dancefloor
mixing into it. The mastering engineers caused nightmares for us. But in the end you’re going to get a hand out. And a big part of that is an article that
was written on me in 1980 in Billboard where I complained about it and nearly
got blacklisted by the Canadian music industry. I was never afraid to speak my
mind and in that case, I think we actually educated the mastering engineers.
When I started my label, I would never let them master a record on their own.
I attended everything, even if I didn’t know what I was doing. I sure as hell was trying to learn at the same time and teach them as well. And I
would also bring other records that had been mastered or mixed to educate
the engineers. Gerd Janson So you had a label of your own as well? Vince DeGiorgio I’ve had quite a few. I started a record label in 1982 called Power Records. I
started it because I was working as a promotion man for Unidisc. Gerd Janson Maybe you could talk a little bit about Unidisc first, a Canadian label? Vince DeGiorgio Sure, Unidisc Productions in Montreal was a company originally called
Downstairs Records. They had a record store on Saint Laurent Boulevard in
Montréal and what they did was, all the DJs went there the same way as they
did with Disco Sound of Canada. What they did was they took them one step
further, they decided to start a record label. And I might be wrong in quoting
who they were, but I believe Pat Deserio was very involved, George Cucuzzella
and Dominic Zarka. One was a business guy, one was the best DJ and one was a
great producer, so it was a great combination. Plus they had the store. So,
Dominique moved on, became my partner in Power Records, eventually. Pat was
a great producer, who worked with Kebekeletrik and a bunch of other big
records like Eclipse. And George actually changed the name and he changed the
name from Downstairs to Unidisc, which was the record label. We’d known each
other for years and he decided to hire me as a promotion guy. The first time I
went to Montreal I saw all the gold records on his wall and I said, “You know what?
I think I’m going to start a label.” So they gave me a distribution agreement
that I hated and George actually didn’t find this out until about two years
ago, because his brother-in-law actually fired me when I wouldn’t sign the
distribution agreement. So I was in the record business. And the first A&R
decision I ever made sold 180 copies. It was actually an English record by a
group called Hello, and it said goodbye really quickly, which is unfortunate,
great band, and they actually have records over on Arista as well. And I
decided that the three things I wanted more than anything was something that
had a lot of energy, a lot of drive and a lot of guts and Power came out of
that name. So I basically decided to start a record label on $250, a check
from my club for working five nights, which proceeded to bounce. Which meant I
had to go and collect the cash to cover the first mastering I did. The first
record I released sold 380 copies. The second record I released sold 4,000 and
the third one sold four million. Gerd Janson Four million? Vince DeGiorgio Yeah. [applause] It’s a really bizarre story, actually. There’s three kids from a Portuguese
neighborhood that were real club kids and they decided to come to the club,
and they were regulars. One of the guys said, “We’re making a record,” and
I said OK. I was at that point their favorite DJ so they always came to see
me. So I said, “Well, I’m thinking of starting a record company.” So I
released the first two records. The first record was a song by a group called
Ambience that went nowhere. Second was actually a re-pressing of “Souvenirs”
by Voyage. And the funny thing is that this record ended up going through a
whole bunch of changes and it also was the first time I ended up writing as
well. They had this concept that was a little bit out there and... Gerd Janson How would you explain writing? Vince DeGiorgio OK, sorry about that. What Gerd has not mentioned is that I’ve been a
songwriter for 25 years now. Gerd Janson Sorry about that. Vince DeGiorgio No, no, no, it’s okay. I’ve been too busy talking and interrupting you the whole
time, but I’ve been a songwriter for years and this was my second foray. It was
the second song I wrote, and I re-wrote a lyrical concept that turned into a
song called “My Forbidden Lover.” And I was basically the lyricist, because I
had actually been threatened with a suspension when I was 11 years old at
school, because we had a poetry contest when I was in sixth grade and that’s
when I knew that I had a talent to write. The teacher forgave me and forgave
himself for accusing me of it and I ended up dreaming of being a writer ever
since that day. So I finally got to put it to use with these two club
regulars. Way too many people involved. And a singer who answered an ad in a
record store on Young Street who got paid $100, and she sang the hell out of the
song and then the record exploded. And you know what happens after that,
right? A young label, a lot of kids, a lot of people who are really at the
beginning of their careers and everyone starts suing everybody, which is
crazy. But the record took off like a rocket, was number one for ten weeks
here. And Tapps still does shows in California 25 years later and Allan
Coelho, who was the principle guy, is making a new record right now. Gerd Janson And how much time did you spend in court? Vince DeGiorgio Well, it never really got to court. Basically, a record that was made for just
under a thousand dollars, I decided that it was part of my blood. So once my
label got more successful, I just bought the entire catalog from the
producer, who was a very clever guy and was a little bit more street savvy
than us. I still own the publishing, I still own the master and, actually, it
can never, ever be sold. It’s actually something that I’ve got with my lawyer
that I will never ever sell it because it’s the most important record I’ll
ever be a part of. And I should tell you one other thing: During the making of
this record I got a phone call from my partner of the time, because there’s
three of us who invested into the original record, and he said, “You’d better
come down here.” I said, “Why?” And he said, “Because the producer’s trying to
make this vocal masterpiece into an instrumental and he’s right about to print
the mix.” I don’t think I was ever in a taxi that fast in my life and
basically just had to settle everybody down, but the record came out and it
led to a great tenure for the label. Gerd Janson And you just mentioned publishing, which is a field where you have some
experience as well, right? Vince DeGiorgio Yeah, I am actually a music publisher today. Gerd Janson So what is publishing exactly? I never understood this. Vince DeGiorgio Let’s say that the next Gino Soccio and Patrick Cowley are these two guys
right here, Gacowley is the name of the band. They come to me and they say,
“We’ve got this record.” Well, what a publisher does is he protects the rights
of the writers by working with the writers to go out and get them to work and
produce with other artists, to collaborate with other artists, and to make
sure that the royalties generated by the manufacture, or now the digital sale
of a piece of music, is paid to the publisher who shares it with the writers.
Does that make any sense at all? Basically, we’re very sexy accountants. We
take care of the things, we do the business side where the creative people
want to be creative, then what we do is we do the administration side. Once
you’re finished we make sure your songs get registered, we make sure if
there’s an opportunity for you to work with other people, we call them and
say, “We’ve got these two unbelievable writers who are going to make you a
star.” And I get you together with my writers. And that’s how the meeting of
the minds comes, where you have people who are writing with one another, how
they exist. A lot of people, like “Disco Inferno” was probably two guys in a
room writing together and it’s sold 75 million copies and a publisher would
take care of those rights. If somebody wants your song for a big movie, well,
they would contact your publisher and your publisher would then contact you
and say, “They are doing Saturday Night Fever 3, they want your song to be
the theme song. They are going to pay us X amount of dollars and they’ll pay
for using the master rights and they’ll pay for what’s called the
“synchronization rights,” which is to put your music in a film. They got to pay
you twice, once to use the audio recording and once to the publisher to take care
of the synchronization of it, to lock it together. Publishing is a very
important business for you aspiring writers and producers. This is the real
estate of the music business, and it’s extremely important for you to know that
everything you do has equity. Never sign a hundred percent of your publishing
away. I know where every one of my songs is from the first one I wrote to the four that got requested by a Japanese label this morning. I know where every
one of them is. And it’s extremely important to me, because it’s you, it’s your
creativity and you must never lose sight of that. A lot of people have and
they’ve gone on to regret it. And you’re also at the forefront of a real,
evolving music world right now, so whether it’s disco or anything else, you’ve
got to take care of your publishing. Gerd Janson Always get your publishing right. So I’ve been asking questions the whole
time, but maybe some of you have questions as well? Audience Member You were just talking about publishing and as a composer I’ve always
wondered what the difference is between keeping my own publishing and just
signing myself up with either Socan or Ascap or BMI or whatever? And then the
difference between doing that and signing it over to you or another publishing company. Vince DeGiorgio Well, if I like it, I’d be really happy to hear that. Obviously, you should register your songs with a performance society, whether or not you’re with CI in Italy or Socan in France or ASCAP or BMI, to register the songs so that you can control the copyright and the ownership of the copyright. If someone can do
something for you as a composer and as a writer, no matter what kind of music
you’re making, you should have a discussion with them. And if you think it’s
good for you, that would be part of your journey. I also think that if you’re
a creative person, whether or not you’re producing tracks or doing any kind of
music, you can collaborate with someone who can do something that you can’t.
That’s why I have had so many mentors and that’s why mentoring many of you
after all this is over is extremely important to me. Audience Member Is there any book on the Canadian disco scene? Do you know about it? Vince Degiorgio I’ve been trying to write one for a long time. There isn’t a book, but I think information-wise, I’ll give you my card and if there’s anything specific or there’s someone you’re trying to reach, it’s pretty easy. We’re a real close, tight-knit community, people back then. There’s also been some great journalists here who have had a long history that I can put you in touch with who have covered things who would probably remember things that I forget myself. There’s been some really interesting books, but I’m such a purist that I tend not to read them. I read the first hundred pages of a book from the UK called Saturday Night Forever. There’s so many errors in it, I just threw it in the garbage. If you were there, the trivia is part of your lifeblood, so it’s hard. The disco craze, or the event that happened during the disco era, it was such a whirlwind and such a crazy time that I don’t think everybody remembers everything. You almost have to... Gerd Janson How can that be? Vince Degiorgio Obviously, a lot of people are no longer with us, and that’s a huge part of it. It’s funny, in the disco world, a lot of people have different concepts of what they saw and seeing it through their eyes. Somebody in New York could say that they played Gino Soccio records nine months before anyone in Canada did. That could be true, but it would be so hard to prove. When I got asked by somebody this week about was Carol Jiani singing the original “Get on Up and Do It Again” by Suzy Q? And the answer is, “Yes.” A lot of people would go, “No, it isn’t. It’s this other girl from Montreal and her name is this and it’s on the record.” You say, “Yeah, it’s been re-recorded, but the original is by Carol Jiani.” Audience Member At the same time, this is what makes the whole thing so wonderful, right? That there’s not one truth, but many different sides of it. Vince Degiorgio It keeps it really interesting for all of us too. For me, when you talk about records that... You know, some records went to number one and some records went to number ten. Records like this one, for example, which is George McCrae working with Gregg Diamond who did Bionic Boogie and who was, to me, one of the greatest of the disco producers from America, it’s what keeps you looking for the facts that, you’ve got ten different versions of the same story. I’m just going to put this on for a minute. (music: George McCrae – “Love in Motion”) The other great thing about disco music itself is that it didn’t have to be the biggest record. It didn’t have to be a number one. It just had to connect with you. Then you’d start talking about it and you could start getting people very involved in what you love as well. Gerd Janson How did you feel about the downfall of disco music then, or the quote/unquote downfall, after all the big hype and then, all of a sudden? Vince Degiorgio In a way, it was bittersweet. The media built it up and the media tore it down. The truth is that when disco became a very, very dirty word and we changed from disco to dance, whatever. Gerd Janson It changed everything then? Vince Degiorgio It’s still disco to me. It doesn’t matter if it was made last week or 1973. Disco, at this point, is the grandfather to all these kids. I was really happy when the media got out of it because Saturday Night Fever was really a media creation. It was a great movie and it gave John Travolta a terrific career, but the Bee Gees songs were never written for the movie. They were written for another album. 99% of the record was pretty much glued together to make a great soundtrack. It’s a great music supervision job, whereas Thank God It’s Friday, which was the movie that Casablanca made that spawned “Last Dance” and “Disco Queen” by Paul Jabara is actually a far truer show. It’s a far truer representation of what disco was than by going to Brooklyn where the crowd was all one ethnic composition. So we were happy when it went away because when disco was killed by the media, the truth of the matter is that they killed it, but they couldn’t put it six feet under. Yet a lot of people just fighting saying, “You know what? This business is a lot stronger than a media who is basically going to cover a cooking show five minutes after they cover a club closing.” The truth is, they accented on the negative so much, we were glad to get rid of them. The great thing is that, suddenly, you had this very beautiful burgeoning underground scene just like you’ve got now. You could say that dance music, or a high energy music, or funk, or the electronic funk music that came in the early ’80s, that was just another baby being born. It was a new evolution for a business and for a medium that had a heart beat long before they tried to kill it and had a bigger one when the industry peaked in their eyes. There were disco specials and disco television shows. I remember distinctly that a lot of what the clubs were doing didn’t really change. I think the clothing changed a lot. What you see me wearing, this is what I wore to work. I once got fired for not wearing shoes in my DJ booth when I was working in a hotel club. My feet hurt. You stand in those shoes for seven hours, they’ll kill your back. They’ll kill your feet. I took them off and they fired me. That’s the shit I wanted to get away from. I just wanted to go where the people would come in, they knew exactly what they wanted, and what they wanted more than anything is they wanted to just hang out with me. Dance their faces off until they couldn’t stand up anymore. That’s really what happened after disco died. The thing is, it never really died, it just went to sleep. Because the truth is, the raw roots and elements of that era, the entire music in the ’70s has come back a zillion times. It’s going to come back again 25, 35 years after I’m gone because it’s too powerful. It’s too strong. Even when we went out last night, I heard the same thing. It was remarkable for me. The music is enduring because you might not love all of it, but you sure will love a lot of it. Audience Member People always want to dance. Vince Degiorgio Yeah, it’s funny, we went out last night and I heard you play. [looks at a participant] I would walk a thousand kilometers to hear you play. You were great because that room was empty, there was 20 people in it, in and out, and you never lost your focus. You could have played in any era. You were great. I really enjoyed myself. I was talking to a couple of the other guys... Please never say the word old-school in front me, I’ll go crazy. A lot of us veteran DJ types, we sat there and went, “She’s great.” One of the guys looked at me and he goes, “I hope she plays Don Ray next,” and, bang, it came on. That’s a generational instinct, that’s what I’m talking about. It doesn’t matter where you’re from, if the music moves you, then it’ll always move you. Audience Member Can I ask a question? Vince Degiorgio Oh, sure. Audience Member A lot of re-edits coming out, I suppose they are illegal in a way, how does this
whole thing work? What can you make out of old tracks without having legal
problems? How are re-edits created? Vince DeGiorgio Basically, when you go into your mix room, or your studio, or whatever you’re
going to do and you do a re-edit, the best thing to do is contact the record company. And if you
don’t know how to get to them, well, you’ll have my card and I’ll get them in
touch with you. The truth is, if you can do things, if you have a gift to do
things and you have the wherewithal to do them legally, it could turn into a
career for you. It could turn into a mix album for you. The truth is that your
inventiveness or your creativity is different. You would do an edit that’s
different than he would, or that I would, or that they would, or anyone else
in this room and the number one thing is to try and get it heard, so the best
thing to be would be to contact the record company or the license owners. And if they won’t talk to you, you have to seek out somebody who will make sure that they talk to you. Audience Member But I think most of the stuff that is coming out is bootleg, actually? Vince DeGiorgio Bootlegs have been part of the dance history and the disco history for years
and a lot of it is for a creative invention. One of the best bootlegs ever
made was a song called “Let’s Do It in the ’80s” that turned into “Stars On
45.” That was a bootleg by three Montreal DJs. Another one is the “Get on the
Funk Train” remix, which we believe Robert Rimet was involved in, and I have a
10" acetate of it and it’s absolutely amazing. And there’s one of “Freedom to
Express Yourself” by Denise La Salle, and if any of you guys or ladies are
playing ’70s disco, you have to get your hands on this if you can find it and
it’s unbelievable. It’s always been part of the culture. I mean, even Patrick
Cowley’s “I Feel Love” was a bootleg. I think it just depends on what side of
the business you want to be on. A lot of the music gets pirated because people
can’t get it. I’m not interested in seeing Chic’s Greatest Hits with the
same 11 songs on it again. It makes me want to shave my head. I want to see
something where, if there’s a remix, someone believes they can actually make
the song better. We have to get the name value thing out of the re-edits and
put the artist back into the picture. If your edits are creative enough,
people are going to want to hear them. And the other thing, too, is people
manufacture these things on their own because they feel that there’s no other
way to get them heard. We’re also at the forefront of a business that is
really going into the digital age and personally I’m amazed at the love for
vinyl here; that has really been a revelation for me. But I just say, find a way. There are people who manufacture vinyl, maybe they have the rights with the
record company and have a way to get your edit re-issued. One of the other
things that’s a problem as well for example, is, let’s say, Dionne Warwick’s
Track of the Cat record was produced by Thom Bell, one of my all time top
ten favourite albums. I have a 7" 33 RPM, seven-minute version of a classic
song called “Once You Hit the Road.” And I begged them to put this on the CD
re-issue and they couldn’t because they needed the artist’s permission to do
it. And that could take hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get in
touch with the lawyers and the accountants and the estate if the person’s no
longer with us. But you’ll get my card, if you really want to do this, send me
the edit and if I like it, I’ll fight for it to get it released because
that’s what Gino did for me. So many people did this for me in the business.
If you want to get there, I’m going to help you get there. It’s that simple.
Next question? Gerd Janson We haven’t heard anything on Power Records. Vince DeGiorgio OK. I’m going to play the follow-up to “My Forbidden Lover,” actually. A song
called “Burning With Fire” and this in its day was actually considered
extremely progressive. They used a lot of Roland microcomposers. I know some
of you guys have 303s and 606s and 808s and 909s and everything. I
originally wrote this lyric for the song and it was originally called “Call
Me” and the producer got into an argument with me and they took
parts of what I wrote and it ended up being “Burning With Fire,” which was
number two record in Mexico, number one record in Holland, number one record here
and number one in the US. (music: Tapps – “Burning With Fire”) It’s funny, listening to that, it’s been a long time. Gerd Janson It sounds like it could have been made in Italy, right? Vince DeGiorgio Yeah, well, that’s the thing, the more arpeggiated some of the synths would
be, they would classify it as Italo disco. But Allan Coehlo, who is the
brainchild of Tapps and is a great musician, he was obsessed with Patrick
Cowley. He was always bothering me for tapes and he really loved making the
stuff. And the other thing, too, about the Tapps record is Barbara Doust is
the singer on “My Forbidden Lover” and on this song. She never performed with
the act. They had a huge, huge falling out and her vocal performances on these
are for Canada an almost evolutionary setting. They are amazing, and these are
one and two take vocals. She could just go. For those of you that are making
records now: Don’t like the singer that is singing on your tracks, love the
singer that is singing on your tracks. If you have that emotional connection
that the song belongs to the singer when they sing it, it’s going to fly.
That’s I think a big part of the reason why this record did what it did. Gerd Janson When was this created? Vince DeGiorgio 1984. Gerd Janson And you were just talking about the singer so the song is very important to you, right? Vince DeGiorgio When we were chatting yesterday and I said there are some nights where you get
into a club and you just leave because you don’t hear enough songs. Having
been a songwriter for 25 years now, having something I can sing along with,
that’s what makes it all work for me. It’s not like I don’t like the
instrumental records, records like “Magic Fly” and “Beyond the Clouds” and
“War Dance” by Kebekelektrik, great electronic records, or Klein and MBO’s
“Dirty Talk” or things like that from Italy, “Feel the Drive” by Doctor’s Cat,
I mean, a lot of those records are really memorable. But to be able to sing along with somebody, even if you have the worst singing voice in the world,
which I do, you feel a completely different connection in my opinion. If the song moves you, then you’ve made the connection with the record and you’ll play
it again. I was out last week and had to go and meet a writer and I had Linda
Clifford and the first Village People record in my car for the day. And it’s
really funny, I live in Vancouver now, and it’s not exactly the disco capital
of the world and I just blasted the thing. I was just hammering it as hard as
I could. I almost got a speeding ticket because I had “San Francisco” going so
loud in the car. The other thing, too, is that when you first sing
along with a record, you have a memory that’s everlasting of going to get it
and how you got it and how much you paid for it and where you were and who you met. Gerd Janson What’s the most you ever paid for a record then? Vince DeGiorgio I’m going to take you back to 1978, today it would be about 50 or 60 dollars
comparatively in price, but we were paying 11 and 12 dollars for imports of
Santa Esmeralda and Patrick Juvet and anything that came from France. They
were the most expensive of all of them. The most I’ve ever spent on a CD was I
spent $40 for Cerrone By Bob Sinclar because I’ve known Cerrone my whole
life and Bob Sinclar really idolizes Cerrone. So I knew he wasn’t going to
screw it up and the funny thing is that someone I knew from the start of my
career was the sales person and I flew into New York and he goes, “Man, you’ve
got to get this, here,” and I bought it. I play it once or twice a week. Gerd Janson But some of the stuff you have in the house of your parents house is worth much more than $40. Vince DeGiorgio So I’m finding out. I was amazed. I have 15,000 pieces of vinyl and I have a great collection of disco compilations because disco means something different
in Germany than it did in England than it did in Italy than it meant in
Canada. And it means something completely different in the US. So as a
songwriter and a music publisher today, I’m always looking for something
special when I travel. My vinyl hound days have never left me. I’m always
looking for something and the compilations are all different in every country.
The disco compilations in Sweden are completely different from the ones you
get in Japan, which are unbelievable. I think I must have Earth, Wind &
Fire on like 30 different compilations, but I have a remix compilation from
Japan with all the songs remixed and the Jacksons all remixed and those things
are clever just to hear the re-invention of the classics too. Gerd Janson Thank you. Any more questions? Then maybe slip on another plate from your
world of merry music and thank you, Vince DeGiorgio. Vince DeGiorgio The last thing I'm going to play, actually, is a record that Giorgio Moroder produced, by a group called Sparks. This record is very pivotal in the history of disco music in this country, because it was a record that nobody wanted to play because it was considered a little bit rock on the fusion side. But the DJs in Montreal made it a point to play this record, to the point that Giorgio actually went in and remixed it. And I'm not sure if the two are interconnected, but it seems ironic that after it became a record as a $60 import that nobody could find, this track called “Beat the Clock” by Sparks, which has one of the best mixing intros you'll ever want on a record. [applause] (music: Sparks – “Beat the Clock”) (music: Kat Mandu – “The Break (Remix)” / applause) Vince DeGiorgio You know the records they were making in Montreal at that time were much more technologically advanced than what we were doing here in Toronto just because they really knew how to be great finishers. But for myself, as I mentioned before, I was a big disco snob. So for me, if the Italians made it, I was gonna play it in a minute. And I think that the one record that’s really telling, and it’s probably my favorite record of that era is by Revanche, called “Music Man.” I think it’s really the life story of the DJ. And it’s Mauro Malavasi, you know... (music: Revanche – “Music Man” / applause) Vince degiorgio ...and you’re just in complete awe. I wanted to make records like that and I never was able to but, I mean, it’s something about having all the elements together. Great session singers from New York, like Bobby and Skip who sang on this record, and Jacque [inaudible] who’s a great producer, and Malavasi who’s the god of the arrangers in Italy. Musicians like Rudy Trevasi and Paolo Gionolo, we knew all their names. If someone did a mix or someone arranged something we all knew it. It was really unbelievable to listen to something like this and to see how incredible it stands up to today’s contemporary music, and the musicianship is mindboggling. We were just lucky. Gerd Janson Do you regret ending your active DJ career? Vince Degiorgio Do I regret ending my DJ career? You know it’s funny, I haven’t really faced it until this week. I have a mother that had 3,000 pieces of vinyl and wanted to know when I’m getting them the hell out of her house. I’ve never touched them until this week, I don’t own a turntable. But I’m really thinking of buying one now. You evolve and you move on. But I’ll tell you something, I had so much fun when I was a DJ and I absolutely loved it but when I decided to let go it was because I knew I’d have the chance to go out and hear somebody like Stonebridge, or somebody like you, or some of the other people I’ve been lucky to hear, as long as my heart is open to change, I could do it again if I want, who knows. I’m never going to close that door, I’ll be a DJ till the day I die. Gerd Janson Thank you very much. Vince Degiorgio You’re welcome.

Richie Hawtin, Pt. 2 (2014)
The second part of our chat with Plastikman himself at the 2014 Red Bull Music Academy in Tokyo. Richie Hawtin has always pushed the envelope: he started Plus 8 Records with John Acquaviva at the turn of the '90s, formed the M_nus empire and developed Final Scratch. His works under the F.U.S.E. guise, the delicious desolation of Plastikman, countless remixes and his groundbreaking works with the Concept series and the Decks, EFX & 909 compilation are all firmly planted in techno's history. A fierce advocate of developing technology as long as it doesn't detract from the physical experience of community, he's continued to operate at the limits, whether it be via his wifi-enabled CONTAKT event series or his successful Ibiza night ENTER. Even after decades in the game, Richie Hawtin lives in the moment, on the cusp of the future.

Title: Sleepy Brown

Sleepy Brown
Organized Noize’s Sleepy Brown had a successful career behind the scenes of some of Atlanta hip-hop’s finest moments throughout the ’90s. But as the decade came to a close, he knew that he wanted more. The result was the funk throwback The Vinyl Room. Out of step with the times, it was passed over by his major label and nearly forgotten. In 2016, RBMA provided Sleepy with a platform to revisit the album, both in conversation and in concert.
In this public lecture with Christina Lee as part of Red Bull Radio: Live in Atlanta, Brown spoke about the album and its genesis before he performed it live in the city for the first time in more than a decade.
Hosted by Christina Lee OK, awesome. Well guys, welcome to RBMA Radio. All this week, we are broadcasting live out of Atlanta. Today we are here with one of Atlanta music’s most crucial figures, Mr. Sleepy Brown. Sleepy Brown Thank you. Christina Lee Yeah. We are here to talk about ... I mean, we’re gonna talk about a little bit of everything, because, you know, your place within Atlanta music history is so crucial. We’re especially gonna be focusing today on an album by the name of The Vinyl Room. First of all, I figured we would start this a little bit not quite at the beginning, but kind of there, because I think I want people to kind of understand that you come from a musical background, but we certainly want you to explain exactly who your father is and why you decided to feature him on the track. Sleepy Brown Okay, my dad was in a band, a popular band in the ‘70s called Brick. A lot of people have sampled him. You might have heard it, Ice Cube “No Vaseline.” They had a song called “Ain’t Gone Hurt Nobody.” (sings “Ain’t Gone Hurt Nobody”) ... Y’all probably don’t remember this at all, but they were a really big band in the ‘70s. I grew up, you know, backstage at all the concerts. They used to come to Atlanta when, you know, we had the Funk Fest, when it would be like Cameo and Parliament and Brick and Commodores. It’s all these funk bands and, you know. I loved growing up in that era because, you know, for me music was everything. You know, I was like, I didn’t know my dad was even a star. Tell you the truth, I went to a concert one night with my grand mamma. I was like six years old and the next thing I know, we were standing on the side of the stage and I looked and I see my daddy out there. I’m like, “What’s going on?” And he’s jamming like this and women reaching for him and I’m like ... Then I hear the song “Dazz” (sings rhythm track) . I’m like, I turned around and looked at my grand mamma, I’m like, “This is what I want to do. I want to do what dad doing.” Ever since then, you know, that’s just been my dream. I always felt like I had to keep that Brown name going. It was a beautiful thing to grow up in that era. The funny thing is that Jermaine Dupri’s dad was Brick’s road manager. Me and Jermaine Dupri grew up backstage together. It’s a lot of history in Atlanta music. Christina Lee Yeah, absolutely, it seems like everyone knows everyone. Sleepy Brown Everybody knows everybody. Definitely. Christina Lee That’s right. Now, as far as your musical background, exactly how hands-on was your dad in trying to teach you? Sleepy Brown Well, I think my dad just wanted me to kind of go for it myself. Kind of like if you really want to do it, because that’s how he was. He would buy me instruments and he bought my first drum set when I was ten and bought me a trumpet. I used to play in the elementary school. I just didn’t really like to play. I love drums. Christina Lee Okay. Sleepy Brown He bought my drum set. Him and my mom were divorced, so I was really with my mom. At a certain age I went over there and stayed with him for a couple of months, and every time he would do a show at night at this club, and he always had this equipment. He would bring it home and I would stay up all night just trying to learn how to play. I think that’s how he trained me. Just put in front of you and see if you’d go for it. Kind of like that. Christina Lee He gave you the necessary tools. Sleepy Brown Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Christina Lee Absolutely. Was it your dad that was in the Ben Hill neighborhood or was it your mom? Sleepy Brown My mom. Christina Lee Okay. Sleepy Brown Yeah. Me and my mom moved to Ben Hill from Savannah. We actually stayed in Atlanta for quite some time, but moved to Ben Hill. That’s where I really grew up at. Christina Lee Okay. Gotcha. I wanted to ask about something that is quintessentially Atlanta, but maybe people don’t quite know about as much, as like with the hip-hop thing. What can you tell the people about Yeeking? Sleepy Brown [laughs] Yeeking is a dance style that started in Atlanta from skating. It’s kind of like what the kids are doing today. That sounds funny saying the kids today. [laughter] You know, Cam Newton doing all this and they go, “Yeek?” It’s kind of the same thing but it started way back with us. We used to dance off fast records that came from Miami, you know, like Luke Skywalker and all that 2 Live Crew music and stuff. We were dancing off that kind of stuff. It was a whole movement in Atlanta because the big thing back then was talent shows. Everybody that did talent shows back in the day ended up being big. The R&B group Silk, Chris Tucker used to do skits in between acts at his school, and everybody that went through that is kind of doing their thing. TLC, all of them. Christina Lee You were in a pretty prominent crew. If I’m... Sleepy Brown Yeah, I was in the best dance crew. Christina Lee What dance crew was that? Sleepy Brown We were called Guess [laughs]. Christina Lee What made Guess so good? Sleepy Brown Because we were all broke, but for some reason ... [laughs] We were all broke as hell, but for some reason, we always came up with the craziest ideas to go on stage with. We would have on ninja suits and kind of act out like ... It’s just kind of hard to explain, you know what I mean? It was just such a big show for nothing. You know what I mean? The talent shows in Atlanta was so big they would be packed in there like standing room only around the basketball court. There might be this much room to dance because everybody done moved in. You know what I mean? It was just that kind of movement. It was really strong. Christina Lee These weren’t like one-off dance moves like with the Whip and Nae Nae, these were like full-on routines, right? Sleepy Brown You not gone get me to dance. Christina Lee What? Sleepy Brown Not gone get me to Yeek in here, gone have me hurting. I might not be able to perform tomorrow. [laughter] My back [laughs]... Christina Lee I just want the people to understand. Sleepy Brown Wow. Okay, yeah. It’s a pretty fast dance ... [laughs] It’s high-powered, it was all moves, it’s ridiculous. Really. If you really want to see the dance, you can look it up on Facebook or YouTube. Just put in “Yeek.” Christina Lee Nice save. Sleepy Brown Well, Yeek, you’ll see the whole dance thing. Christina Lee At this point, how into music were you? Were you already sort of fiddling around with equipment? Sleepy Brown Just a little bit, like drums. My favorite thing to do was close the door and take my little lamp and make a spotlight and play the Jackson’s album live, and act out the whole album. [laughs] That’s how I trained myself. As a kid, you’re a superstar as a kid. I just had big dreams. I didn’t really take it seriously and really start producing until I was like maybe 18. It took a while. I was just a fan of music. I remember me and Rico, when I first met Rico, we went to the MC Hammer concert. He was like, “Yeah, I got an extra ticket, why don’t you come on?” Me and him ended up being Dungeon Family. We all were just big fans of music. We loved when artists came to our town. We loved everything about it. That’s really what it was. I didn’t really take it seriously, though, until I was 18. Christina Lee What was the turning point? What got you into production? Sleepy Brown When I was staying with my dad, like I said, he would bring the equipment home. I remember one night I said to myself, I was like ... My favorite funky love song was “Between the Sheets” by the Isley Brothers. I said, “If I can sit here and play everything over to the t and make it sound just like the record, I can produce.” You have to sit there, you have to figure out the chords. I don’t know names of chords or nothing. I play by ear. I’m sitting there like play it, ding ding ding, play it, ding ding ding. You know what I’m saying? Just sitting there doing it like that and then I finished it in maybe 30 minutes and was really shocked. It was like 3 in the morning and I went and woke my dad up. Like, “Dad. Listen to this. Listen to this.” That’s when he kind of knew it, too. He was like, “Mm-hmm (affirmative). You’re ready.” From there, I just started thinking of my own ideas to try to play. Christina Lee Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. We’re going to play another record that I guess is largely considered the beginning for most Organized Noize bands, even though it might not be technically. Let’s see here. (music: Outkast – “Player’s Ball”) Okay. I saw you guys out there. That was amazing. Of course that is “Player’s Ball” by Outkast. What do you remember about recording that track? Sleepy Brown At the time, we were actually in 3 different studios doing 3 different projects. Me and Rico ended up riding to where Ray was and I remember we were starting to do the Outkast thing because we just did a Christmas song with TLC, “Sleigh Ride”. That’s when LA told us like, “Yo, you got y’all chance if y’all can come out with a Christmas record, we’ll put it on there.” We was like, “Okay.” We had ideas but they were kind of cool but not quite it. When we went over there and Ray was doing that beat for this group, Je Ne Sais Quoi, I believe. It was Left Eye’s group at the time, or Drip Drop. One of the two. We walk in and that beat is playing and me and Ric just look at each other like, “What the? Oh my God. What is this?” Ray’s like, “Yeah, I was going to give it to them.” Ric was like, “No. No you’re not. You’re going to give that to Outkast. That’s going to be Outkast’s record. That’s going to be Outkast’s record.” We were like cool and then the next thing you know, it’s this record. I think it’s called “Hustler’s Ball” or something like that with this guy explain all the players that are pulling up at the club. Rico went in and kind of did that at the beginning of the record. When he said, “Man, all the players ...” I was like, it popped. “All the players came from far away.” It went smoothly like that. That’s when we knew that we had a sound for Outkast. Christina Lee That was it. Sleepy Brown “Player’s Ball” was the record. That was that record. Christina Lee Wow. Is it true that you were among the first people in Organized Noize to meet up with LA Reid? Sleepy Brown Yeah, yeah. Me and Rico, me and Rico was in a singing group together. Christina Lee What was it called? Sleepy Brown The You Boys. Christina Lee Okay. Sleepy Brown We had a chance to meet with ... We all grew up together with T-Boz, Tionne with TLC. When they got they deal, she always promised us that she would hook us up or tell Pebbles about us. Her and someone else set up a meeting for us. When we went in there, I was doing all the beats for the group at the time. Every time we played a record, Pebbles was like, “Who did that bass line?” Everybody pointed at me. She’d be like, “Who did that beat?” Everybody pointed at me. “Who did that?” Everybody pointed at me. She looked at me, she was like, “You need to meet LA.” I love Pebbles because, really, she’s the one that jumped it off for us. She set up a meeting. I went in and met LA and didn’t even sign with LA and LA bought me $10,000 worth of equipment. Within the next 2 days, a big truck pulled up at the house and my mamma was like, standing like. I was like, “Yeah, mom, yeah. Yeah, I did it mamma. Yeah. That right.” Everything changed with me and mamma. She went tripping and [inaudible 00:17:05] and everything was beautiful. LA just took me under his wing. I played him one beat in the meeting and he was just like, “You got equipment?” I was like, “No, I work with my friend’s equipment.” He got the equipment for me. He took me under his wing and then I eventually brought Rico around to meet him. Once he met Rico, he fell in love with Rico because Rico is such a powerhouse with his talk. That boy can talk. He ain’t no joke. Christina Lee Right. Sleepy Brown Yeah. He make everybody laugh and smile and cry. Christina Lee Next thing you know, you get $10,000 worth of equipment to your house. Sleepy Brown You get, yeah. You’re good. You’re sitting at home working on beats. Christina Lee From what I understand, LA wasn’t all that knowledgeable in hip-hop necessarily. Sleepy Brown No. LA had no idea about hip-hop at the time. Outkast was the first. When Outkast came out and everybody found it was LaFace Records, they could not believe it. They were known for Babyface and Pebbles and Whitney Houston. They were a big pop label, like number 1 honestly. Then when Outkast came out with this slump record that sound like LA went to the hood and rolled by the hood somebody threw it in his car. Like he drive by like. It was like a, we felt great about that because we were like, “Man, LA we got you respect in the hip-hop game now.” Everybody trust your word because you trust us. Christina Lee Right, right. Exactly, exactly. Let’s see. At this point, the kid is singing the Jackson 5 in his room, having dreams of a solo career. Were those ambitions still on your mind when you guys were in talks with LA Reid and trying to get Outkast off the ground? Sleepy Brown Yeah, yeah. Every special moment I got in meetings and everything, I always sitting and thought about that. It’s funny because I was talking to one of my great friends, he’s a guy named Slick. He’s a writer. He wrote on the Sleepy’s Theme album with me. Me and him grew up together since elementary school and I told him, I said, “Bro, do you remember when we used to sit at the lamp post at night, sitting in the corner in the summer time talking about we wanted to be stars?” I always think about that when any great opportunity comes like that. To tell you the truth, to be honest with you, I really felt like it had to happen because it happened for my dad. You feel me? Christina Lee Mm-hmm (affirmative). Sleepy Brown It’s like … what my dad showed me, it’s like if you really, really do something, and you do it to the t, and your way, it’s going to work. Christina Lee Yeah. Sleepy Brown It doesn’t matter. For years, you know, at first we could not get Outkast a deal. We stepped up to everybody. Everybody was scared of them. We stuck to our guns, and we just stayed true to what we did, because L.A. told us “no” at first. Then we came back and he was like, “Okay, I’m going to take a chance with you guys.” He took a chance with us. Christina Lee Yeah, exactly. Did you guys have, and by “you guys” I mean obviously Organized Noise, did you guys have conversations at this point about where you guys were headed and/or how your sole ambitions could potentially fit into all that? Sleepy Brown No, we just kind of ... This is how we felt, as long as we had a hit, any door would open. As long as we had a record that was just, I don’t want to say idiot-proof, but easy, you know, every time you hear it it’s just “boom”, you’ll win. That’s always been our goal. We knew we had talent and we could go in meetings and make anything happen, but at the same time we had to have the music to go with it. We had to make sure that the crew and all the rappers were right, so that’s why you hear about the dungeon and how everybody sat down the steps, and we’d just be sitting there writing, and just writing, and just writing because we knew we had to represent. We didn’t want to come to the game, “Oh, they’re all right.” We wanted to come to the game and make some noise because we were like, “Man, Dre he representing L.A. to the fullest. I’ve never been to Compton, but damn sure love it.” I love Compton and I’ve never been, but he made me love it. You feel me? Christina Lee Yeah. Sleepy Brown That’s how we wanted to feel about Atlanta. That’s why we were like East Point, College Park, Decatur. Where you at? Do you know what I’m saying? Let’s stand up. Let’s march on. Let’s move it. Christina Lee This is how bad you guys wanted it. You guys weren’t sitting on the stairs just because it was the most comfortable, but literally there wasn’t any floor in the basement, right? Sleepy Brown Yeah, but here’s the best thing about it, it was all dirt. We had an old raggedy speaker. We had a raggedy table with a raggedy speaker. We had an old table sitting up here, we had the MP sitting up there. The walls were all dirt. It might have been, like, from here, like this much room. It was like two poles in there and then these raggedy steps coming down. When you hit play on that drum machine, it was the best studio in the world. You weren’t thinking about no dirt, you weren’t thinking about [inaudible], nothing. [laughter] Everything was great in there. I loved the dungeon. I laugh at Rico because sometimes we just have to go back. Let’s just go back down in the dirt man, and just see what we come up with. I doubt we can do that now. Christina Lee I bet you still could. (music: Sleepy’s Theme – “Still Smoking”) For those who may still need an explanation, who was Sleepy Brown at this point in time? You talked about it a little bit, but who were you at this period? Sleepy Brown I was just trying to figure it out as an artist because the one thing about it … to sing R&B music at that time it was totally different, so I wasn’t like the norm. Like a normal singer, you know what I mean? I was just trying to find myself in that game. I appreciate that everybody loved everything, loved the ideas and everything, but it was kind of hard to try to figure out where to go next. Being a young man with money, just acting a fool. It was all a lesson, but at that time, Sleepy, he was fun, but he was lost. Christina Lee How old were you? Sleepy Brown I was 26, 27. Christina Lee 26, 27, still young and you have a lot of money. Sleepy Brown A lot of money. I was acting a fool. But it was fun, you’re young, you know? Christina Lee Right. Sleepy Brown I would tell any young person, “Man, have fun.” You’re only young once. I’m not doing it now, clearly. Ain’t that right, baby? I’m chilling, but it’s all a part of growing up. Christina Lee Speak more on how you weren’t part of the norm at the time doing R&B. Are you talking about R&B versus hip-hop or are you talking about R&B versus R&B? Sleepy Brown R&B versus R&B because I was never called a neo soul artist, you know the neo soul movement came in with D’Angelo and Erykah Badu? They didn’t really put me with that, which was kind of strange to me because that’s what I thought … I was kind of in that genre, but it wasn’t like that. I was with Outkast, so it almost made me a rapper, but I wasn’t a rapper. I was singing the hooks with them, but you never heard me rap on the Outkast record. I never rapped. I don’t do that, so by me being with them and I guess sometimes people would be like, “Well, he Outkast, so he really on some rap.” It’s not really ... It’s kind of hard to place it, you know what I mean? I always thought I was in that genre, though. That’s what I always thought. Christina Lee Yeah. So were your ambitions with this album to kind of prove that you were part of that? What did you want to accomplish with the Vinyl Room? Sleepy Brown I just wanted to do the funkiest, most wonderful, exciting album ever. I just wanted to do the most funkiest album ... When you play the album, I just wanted you to just sit back, and just ride out. If you’ve had a long day, play the album. If you’re smoking, if you don’t smoke ... Whatever you do, at that time when you got to relax, throw that on. Christina Lee I mean, depending, you could probably get a contact high from listening to this album. Sleepy Brown That’s what I’m talking about. That’s the greatest. I like that. Christina Lee What people have to understand about this album was, I guess, what got you to the point where you were like, “Okay, I’m going to break out and do something called Sleepy’s Theme.” What was your relationship like with Organized Noise at this period in time, and what were your feelings toward that sort of work you were doing? Sleepy Brown At the time, I really wanted to kind of start doing some stuff by myself. I had no problem working with other artists, but just like I said when I was young I saw my dad do that. That was in my heart, so where my heart wanted to go, that’s what I was going to do, so my relationship with them was not really shaky, because they understood completely where I came from because they knew that’s what I wanted but of course, when you have a business, you have other things that you have to do that should get done. I think that might have been just a little conflict that we did have but Rico totally understood, Ray totally understood. Matter of fact, Ray did the album with me. It was me, Ray, and Pimp C, before Pimp C passed, did the album with me. I just wanted... I got Pimp because he was like a brother to me and if anybody knew where I was at, was him. Me and him, you hear the sound, you hear Pimp on, it’s crazy. I love that boy. I miss him to death. (music: Sleepy’s Theme – “Simply Beautiful”) Christina Lee How did you meet Pimp C? Sleepy Brown Actually through Gipp. I was a big Pimp C fan, big UGK fan and I always wanted to work with him and meet him. I met Bun first actually and then Gipp was actually real good friends with Pimp and Gipp told Pimp to come by the dungeon. It was funny I was at home and I called, I was like, “What’s going on over there?” He was like, “Man, nothing. Pimp C’s about to come through.” “What?” I flew over there and met him and we talked and stuff, hung out and then just became best of friends because I wanted him to know I connected with him on that level of funk that he was on. It was just ridiculous. You know what I’m saying? Me being a fan of Pimp, I just wanted to meet him and talk to him, even if we didn’t hang out then, I just wanted to meet him. Christina Lee What would you guys talk about? Sleepy Brown Man, everything, weed, women, cars, what old music we liked, just everything. Life. He was cold. He was a great dude. Christina Lee What sorts of music would you guys talk about? Sleepy Brown We would talk about Bobby Womack, Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes ... He might be like sleeping, “Man ooh, watch this right here, I found this, I ride it right. Listen to this.” He would play this break that he found on Barry White. It was just like ridiculous, you know what I’m saying? He would screw it down and he was just a scientist at it. It was just beautiful. Christina Lee Was he the first person who you reached out for The Vinyl Room? Sleepy Brown No, the first one actually was Ray. Christina Lee Okay. Sleepy Brown I knew I wanted Ray to do it with me and Pimp was the second one because me and Ray were just working anyway and we actually did a song, “Choked Out Saturday Night,” and I was at his house in his record room, because he had a record room. All these crates and records and stuff and he had the turntables and drum machine set up on his little thing right next to, so he would just play his records and sample ... We ended up working on “Choked Out Saturday Night” at his house and I think that was the first record that really showed me that I could do the Sleepy’s Theme album. Christina Lee Yeah? What was it about that session that ... Sleepy Brown It was just that song to me, “Choked Out Saturday Night,” that sounds so Atlanta. It sounds like the old Atlanta, you know what I’m saying, when it was just ... I mean, it’s the same. It didn’t really change, but it was just beautiful, you know what I mean? It was just, it was simple. It was a little more simple back then. It was just a little smooth, you know what I’m saying? I just felt like that record sounded like I was rolling in a Cadillac about 12 midnight, going to another club. That’s what it sounded like, you know? Christina Lee Getting into some trouble, maybe? Sleepy Brown Yeah, getting into some trouble. We having fun. Fun stuff. Christina Lee Is it true that one of the other tracks in the Vinyl Room was initially for one of Pimp C’s solo projects? Sleepy Brown Yeah, actually that was, “Simply Beautiful.” Christina Lee It was that one? Sleepy Brown Yeah, it was that one. That was the one he played me that beat and I begged him for it. I was like, “Man, come on, man, you do beats all day, man. Give me that beat, man. Come on, Pimp.” Eventually, he did. Christina Lee How were you able to convince him though? I mean, that beat sounds great. Sleepy Brown Yeah, just hanging around him and smoking with him. I kept bugging him. Kept rolling up, kept bugging him. “Hey man, so what you think? Don’t you think that’s rent, right? I think you should give it to me, for all that, it would be right, right? Right?” [laughter] Christina Lee How did you form the group that would become Sleepy’s Theme? Because people have to recognize that you had actual musicians. Sleepy Brown Oh, great musicians. First of all, shout out to Preston Crump, played bass on all our music from “Cell Therapy” to “Player’s Ball”. He played everything, so that was the first guy that I got, Preston. The rest of the guys actually came from Society of Soul. When we did that album, we went out on the road for a promotional tour. Big played drums, everybody that was in the band played on that tour so I knew that was some of the baddest players in Atlanta, honestly from Billy Odum, guitar player, Big played drums, Eddie Stoke played keys, and there was such a ... In a pocket sound, so I knew those were the guys that I was going to mess with, plus we had great chemistry and I was free with them as far as being in the studio. I would just be like, “Play it like this.” I might give the line but I’m like, “Just freestyle it. Play it the way you want to play it.” If you feel it somewhere else, take it somewhere else. That’s kind of what it was. Christina Lee Yeah, and you had Keisha Jackson on here too? Sleepy Brown Ah, Keisha Jackson, yeah, that’s Millie Jackson’s daughter. Keisha Jackson is awesome, the greatest soul singer, slept-on soul singer I’m going to say too, because I really feel like if everybody really heard her heard her, they would fall in love with her voice because it’s just, as soon as she hit that first note it sounds like church by the start. It go, “Rrrrr.” You know what I’m saying? That organ open up and she’s ... beautiful voice. Christina Lee There was another interview where you called this your garage punk project which I thought was so interesting because you’re referencing all these older soul music so ... Sleepy Brown It was really garage funk bands. Christina Lee Garage funk? Oh, okay. Sleepy Brown Yeah, it was funk. Christina Lee What was it about these sessions that had you feeling that way? Sleepy Brown I kind of wanted to get that feeling of when my dad done recording. With that album, like on certain songs, it was just straight band, like, “Still Smoking,” it was just, we were all in the studio and Eddie started playing those keys but he was playing it real fast and I was like, “Just slow it all the way down. Just.” Whap. Boom. Just, like, “Funk it out.” You know what I’m saying? That’s how our sessions would go. If I walk in they might be playing something. I’d be like, “Man, that sound good if you did it this way.” Or sometimes, I would be in there playing something and you know, come up with a full idea so, that’s kind of what it was. (music: Sleepy’s Theme – “Choked Out Saturday Night”) Christina Lee I really feel like you need to expand on what night time Atlanta is like, because this is broadcasting around the world. I want people to get a good idea what that was like for you. Sleepy Brown Well, night time Atlanta ... Right now it’s, well what it used to be is was all the strip clubs. Christina Lee Used to be? Sleepy Brown Yeah. Well it still is, but now you got all these regular clubs that are jumping too. Atlanta is known for the strip scene. You know Magic, GC, what’s the other one? Blue Flame, all them things. Christina Lee Which ones were your favorite? Sleepy Brown Gentleman Club. Gentleman Club. I think I rented a room. I think I had a little apartment or something, I don’t know. I just, I couldn’t leave or something or some reason. Christina Lee Hang around for a month. Sleepy Brown Yeah. Just paying rent per month. They actually had a great cook. Man that cook was insane. Big old dude, he’s wearing glasses down like this. “We ain’t got no more green beans. I make you some pasta. And something else.” Boy he could cook. He was awesome. Plus the girls too. Christina Lee So that’s why you lived there? Sleepy Brown Yeah. Christina Lee Well it sounds like a great time. Sleepy Brown You know what, that club, we raised so much hell in that club that when they closed it down they knocked the building down. They took it down. It was so much going on over that … because who owned it was Michael Childs, he got in trouble. Went to jail. It was so much going on over there they knocked the building down and make it into a little park. It’s crazy. That’s how much craziness went on over there. Christina Lee It’s all your fault. Sleepy Brown No, now don’t blame me. Christina Lee When you hear, just on a total side note, when you hear all the later rappers like … today and like Magic City and maybe even Follies or whatever, what do you think of all that? Of how the strip clubs have popularized and all that. Sleepy Brown I think it’s still the same. It’s been this way since early ‘90s, even before then. It’s still the same old thing. That’s what Atlanta is. It’s a party city. You come here to party and then once you get here and see how cool it is, and how cheap it is, you like I’m going to move down here. Now you’re here. That’s exactly what happens. You always say you’re coming down here for a weekend with your friends, like, “We had a ball last ... How much it cost? Really? Okay.” Then you move, end up staying. Christina Lee Pimp C lived here. You got to understand that he was living here at the time. Sleepy Brown Yep. He was living here. Out there by Six Flags actually. Christina Lee It sounds like a great, fantastic time, but you said earlier that you were feeling lost. What was ... Why do you think you felt that way? Sleepy Brown Well, because I was just doing way too much, you know. Drugs to everything else. I was living like a rock star. When it came to organizing, though, it was kind like sleep is the rock star. I was just having fun. I didn’t have money, it was just whatever. When I say lost, I was just saying just to the point where, you had to look yourself in the mirror like, “Hold on man. Chill out.” You know what I’m saying? “You’re doing way too much. Go to bed. You’ve been up for 4 days. What are you doing?” Your self start talking back to you. You know how you know you need to go to sleep. [laughs] When you start answering yourself you’re like, “Okay, I need to go to bed.” It was just too much of that. Too much partying. Christina Lee Was it true that you weren’t really on speaking terms with Rico Wade for a little bit? Sleepy Brown Yeah, we fell out for a minute. What was crazy though, because it didn’t last long or anything. You know, because we’re brothers. This is the thing about it, even though we really weren’t speaking, I would still stop by the studio and play on stuff, and just leave. You know what I mean? Because we’re working. We really wasn’t speaking too tough, but we still worked together so we always had to still see each other. Eventually it just became from not talking to, “you hungry? You want to go somewhere?” Then talk about it. It was kind of like that. You know? Brothers get into it all the time. Family just, that just how it go. Everything runs smooth and nothing goes wrong? Wow. That’s amazing. Christina Lee Explain to those listening what exactly was going on in regards to Organized Noize, Interscope, and then your place, or Sleepy’s Themes place within all that. Sleepy Brown At the time we did a $20 million deal with Interscope. I think the problem was when we went with LaFace, we had LA, the thing that LA did for us, since he was an artist and producer he understood us. He would let us know what we needed to do with certain things. We kind of needed that. What Jimmy gave us, Jimmy just gave us the money, but didn’t give us the closeness. I think that’s what happened with us. Then we started thinking we had to just start going all kind of places. It lost structure to the company. That’s basically what happened. When I did the Sleepy’s Theme album and Jimmy found out, and was really kind of upset. We set up to have a meeting. I flew to L.A. Played the album for him and told him, I was like, “Man it’s no problem, because whatever you want Jim, of course.” We sat there, we listened to it and he really didn’t like it. I was just like, “I can understand that.” At the time Sleepy’s Theme weren’t was playing on the radio. It was just, it was underground for what it was. I think that’s what happened with Interscope. Plus it was starting to be so much pressure on us, individually too. That happens with anything that starts to grow. Sometimes it will get too big for you. You don’t grow with it. It will get bigger than you. That’s what happened. Christina Lee How did it get to the point where you released it independently? Sleepy Brown Actually I met this lady named Eileen Burns and she actually owned a label that my father’s band was on, Brick, which was Bang Records. I went to the studio one night and she was up there and I played it for my dad. I was actually playing it for him. When she heard it she just fell in love. Was like, “Oh my god, that’s just beautiful, we can ...” I’m like, and I had nowhere to really take it because I was kind of holding it. We talked and I decided to do a little deal with her, this one album deal and we did that, shot some videos and stuff like that. That was the thing that I did, I went with Bang Records Company and basically put the album out through them. Christina Lee Gotcha. At this point, before you even got in talks with them, were you just thinking that you were just going to hold on to this for, until who knows when, or were you dead set on getting it out? How did you feel about the album? Sleepy Brown I was dead set on getting it out, I just didn’t know how. This was before downloads and everything, this is like hard copy CDs. They used to have this company that would print your CDs up. You get 1,000 CDs for $100 or something like that. That’s what was going on. If I had to do it and sell out of the trunk I was going to do it, but it just so happened I met her and she was so excited about the project. Way more excited than me. I was like, “Okay, you that excited, you can do something with it.” We kind of went with it. It didn’t work out how we wanted it to. We got some good things out of it. Of course, she got in some trouble with, I guess, IRS or whatever, and she dip. For a minute, the album was out but it wasn’t getting pressed up. They couldn’t press no copies up. We lost a lot on that. Christina Lee How do you feel about that album in retrospect? Sleepy Brown I’m glad I did it. Every time I listen to it, it just makes me smile because I just remember the moments of coming up with each record. I remember it takes me back to working with Pimp C. It takes me back to all the love that I had with the band in doing that album, because everybody wanted to be a part of it. I had Joy singing on it. Keisha Jackson. I had everybody in the family. I had CeeLo on a song called “Curse On You”. I had everybody on that album in the family. They wanted to see it done. I love it. The ultimate thing is, I would like to do a little small tour with it. Just go city to city and even if you haven’t heard it, just come out and listen to it. Vibe out with me. When you leave, you might love it. (music: Outkast – “So Fresh, So Clean”) Christina Lee How did your relationship with Organized Noize compare at this period of time, to before you started Sleepy’s theme? Sleepy Brown This was when everything was groovy, you know what I mean? Went over Rico’s house like normal, normally. Started playing this little … started playing that little note. (hums melody) Ric heard it, he was like, “I don’t know, I think we might have a beat there. Let me see what I got over here.” He kind of started like ... and then we just started playing it. I went in … because I couldn’t come up with the words at the time. One thing I loved about Ric, Ric was real hip on just saying, just the hippest shit ever. I went in there and just did the little melody of it. Came back the next day, Rico told me. Said he woke up. Say he got in the shower, he was playing it. He was like, “Ain’t nobody know ... so fresh and so clean, clean.” When I got there, he said, “I got it.” He told me and I went in and sung and it and it just ... it worked. It worked. It really worked. We’re like, “Wow.” You know what’s funny? Dre didn’t like that record at first. Christina Lee Dre didn’t like it? Sleepy Brown Yeah. He ... because Stankonia, that album, was where Outkast started going to more like Jimi Hendrix kind of like ... adding guitar, rocking, certain things. “Bombs Over Baghdad” … he just started doing a whole ‘nother kind of vibe, so at first “So Fresh, So Clean” is just a little too cool. A little too ... you know what I’m saying? Dre was … he was way more hype then. It took ... Big loved it though. I knew Big would love it, because I just knew he would love something like that. Once Big said he would do it, we kind of added a couple more things, Dre put his verse on it last. He was finally like, “Yeah, yeah. I do like that.” Christina Lee How long did it take for you to convince him like, “Dude, just get on this record already.” Sleepy Brown It wasn’t like that. We kind of knew, because when he heard it wasn’t really finished. We had the hook on it. It didn’t really had a bass line on it. It was just a beat with the chords. It was still kind of empty for him, so he couldn’t hear the full thing of it. Once we got Preston on it, he started playing it. He started playing that. Dre started hearing other melodies. That’s when he came with the “coolest motherfuckers on the planet.” It gave him that vibe, so that’s what it was. Christina Lee Yeah. Was it like that working with Outkast a lot of the time? Where you have one opinion … you have, Big’s feeling this way and you have Dre feeling this way? Sleepy Brown It started getting like that once they really started producing they own stuff. You know what I mean? That’s how it was. That’s what we wanted from them, because when we used to be in the studio, we wouldn’t be like, “No, you can’t watch. Go out there. Go watch TV or something.” We would be like, “Just sit right there.” They’ll see us program beats, playing all their stuff. We wanted them to learn, you know what I’m saying? Once they started “Bombs Over Baghdad”, “Miss Jackson”, we were just like, “Oh yeah. They graduated. They good.” They might not even need us no more! We were definitely proud of them. I was like, man. When Dre did “Hey Ya”, I was ... oh that was a sick record. Christina Lee You remember hearing that for the first time? Sleepy Brown Oh yeah. It was funny because when I heard that, I hadn’t heard what Big was going to drop yet. This is … I’m gonna make a jump but this is the how “The Way You Move” came to be, because I went over to Big’s house for a cookout. Big used to have this … that’s when he used to have the 200 CD changer. It’d be like 200 CDs staying up to here but they always changing. For some reason, I’m in the boom-boom room … we having a cookout … and that beat comes on. I was sitting there talking to my homie listening and I just stop. What was that? I started hearing that melody, “I like the way you move.” I ran to B, I was like, “B, I think I got something for you.” What I’m thinking is, we need something we was going to do with Dre, because Dre got “Hey Ya”. We got to get something … I was like, “Let’s go to the studio. I got ...” We went to the studio that night. It just came. It just came right then We were like, “Yep. It’s going to be something right here. This is going to be something right here.” Christina Lee You came straight from a cookout? Sleepy Brown Yeah, we came straight from his cookout. Straight to studio. Straight to Stankonia. Jump right on. Put the beat down. Took the CD out the CD changer. Took it out of the studio. Two-tracked it. Just jumped on it. It went. Then once we did that, we got the idea, then Big started building on it and got Debra to come in and play bass. (hums bassline) They started adding the horn. (hums horn) All that stuff. Christina Lee Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How did it feel to perform songs from the Organized Noize catalog when you guys did the homecoming concerts in Centennial Olympic Park? It was like 3 nights. Sleepy Brown That was one of the best shows we’ve ever done. I was really worried about the weather, or really worried hoping there weren’t going to be no fights. It was such a beautiful, beautiful moment in time for just Atlanta. The weather, the perfect … We got out there. We did the show. They had that box out there. It was just a beautiful … the sound was great. Everything went perfect. That was just … for all 3 nights to just go perfect like that … that was beautiful. That was one of the best concerts we’ve ever done it. Ever done it. Christina Lee I would love to take questions from the audience. Audience Member My name’s Tim Arrington, producer and trumpet player from Durham, North Carolina. Sleepy Brown Okay cool. Audience Member What do you think about Atlanta’s music scene now, and where do you see it going? Sleepy Brown I have … I’m going to tell you the truth … I have no problem with the music scene right now. It’s kind of like ... when I was young, and we had all the bass music, I would hear people saying, “Man, what is that garbage you playing? Stop playing it.” To us, it was that thing. That’s how I feel about this generation of hip-hop. I feel like the Young Thugs ... all this music, some might not like it, but who cares, that’s not for you. That’s for who likes it. You know what I mean? The same thing happened with NWA when NWA first came out, they got dissed like a ... Boy, I remember it was just like, “Man this is like ... what is this?” Snapping on it. But at the same time now they in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. To me, I love this generation of music. I think it’s really dope. I got love for my boy, Future, because Future is Dungeon Family. I’m with it. I love it. There’s nothing wrong with it to me at all. Christina Lee Especially in regards to Future, you’ve literally seen him grow up. You’ve seen him grow up into Meathead and then you saw him grow up into Future. When you’re listening to his music, can you pick out the Dungeon Family influences where you hear his stuff? Do you feel like you can detect that? Sleepy Brown The melodies, the melodies he sings. I think the melodies really remind me of just that whole Dungeon flavor. Future, the funny story is, I didn’t even know that Meathead had a record out and his name was Future. I had just came back to Atlanta, and I had heard his song on the radio, I think it was “Racks on racks on racks,” that song. I’m hearing this, right? I’m like, “Man, that voice sounds so familiar to me,” but I could not ... I just didn’t think about it. I went to the gas station. I was buying some cigarettes, which you should not smoke. Saw this CD of the ... I’m like, “Oh man, that’s Meathead.” I’m looking at it, it’s like Dirty Sprite. I’m like ... I call Rico, because Rico’s his cousin. I’m like, “Ric, Meathead a...” He like, “Yeah, man. His name’s Future. He doing it.” I was like, “What?” Then I started getting into everything he was doing. I was so proud of him because I had no idea ... I was in Vegas. I had no idea what he was doing. When I went home and heard the streets and who they were talking about, I was like, “Wow.” Rico had actually put him out in a group called Connex. It was a pretty good album, just didn’t ... No support on it, never took it anywhere to get signed or anything. It was a really good album, and we always said he had that thing, like he was going to be somebody. When I got back to Atlanta and found out it was him, I just had the biggest smile. I was just like, “Wow. That is so dope,” because I was hoping that somebody from the Dungeon would come back and run something. Where’s everybody? What boy is it? Then to hear Future, that’s what I’m talking about. Represent, baby. That’s how you do it. Audience Member My question is, I feel like our generation, in general, is very creative with anything and I feel like we are the only people that can kind of stop ourselves. What are some type of words that you can give to us, or just ways that we can continue to keep pushing ourselves so don’t give up? I know it doesn’t happen overnight. It takes years. You know, it might take a long time for you to get where you need to be. I just want to know some type of encouragement, or even certain things that you’ve done that can probably be influencing to others. Sleepy Brown Don’t stop. The day that you stop is the day it’s over. That’s what we always believed at the Dungeon. It took us years to finally, for ... When LaFace moved to Atlanta, we still didn’t get with them until two or three years later. It takes time sometimes. You got to have patience and still believe in what you do. We sent music to everybody. Somebody might be like, “It’s okay.” Then this person might be, “This is whack.” Then this person might be like, “I hear potential.” I hear you all, but I believe in what I’m doing. By us being that way, that’s why Outkast is how they are today. You got to believe in yourself. I know that’s just a normal thing to say. That is so true. Do not stop believing in what you do. Period. Audience Member I just was wondering if you could elaborate on the atmosphere of the AUC back when you were coming up in the music industry, because I know that you and Big Boy had the song, “Morris Brown.” Sleepy Brown Yeah. Audience Member You know, they were a big part of the AUC back in the day, so I was wondering if you could elaborate on that? Sleepy Brown I think it was just a part of Atlanta. It’s like when you arrived in Atlanta, you had to go right through the college scene. That’s kind of what we were doing, playing new records, while we ran through slow, just to see if somebody turn around or something like that. That was a big part of just the South and our growth, the whole college scene. I love the college scene out here. It’s a beautiful thing. That’s all it was for us. It was about cruising through, looking at everybody, and that was it. Ride through, turn back around, ride through again, turn back around, ride through, get something to eat, turn back around, ride back through. That’s just all it was, but that was Atlanta. It was like Freaknik. Freaknik. Exactly what is was. Christina Lee What was Freaknik like for you? Sleepy Brown Freaknik was a bunch of traffic, but it was so much fun. That’s all Freaknik was. I’ll never forget, we were on 75, 85 right by the 20 Exit, and all of a sudden, all the traffic stopped and all the kids got out of their cars and started dancing on their cars. I couldn’t believe how crazy ... It was just ... Atlanta had just got really crazy. That’s when they tried to stop you from driving and just walk, walk around downtown. That, naw, that wasn’t it. Freaknik was all about driving around and just drive slow in traffic for hours, and looking at the next car, “Hey, what’s up?” That was all it was. And dudes with cameras. Oh and girls shaking their butt out the windows. Can’t forget that. Christina Lee Minor note. Audience Member I just wanted to ask how you remain so humble and personable because I feel the energy. I feel like it’s just speaking to a normal person. You have all this accolade behind you, and I just wonder how you remain so humble and relatable? Sleepy Brown Thank you. I actually get it from my dad. My dad is the most humble person in the world, and I think by him being humble, it brought a lot of gifts and a lot of openings for him. In my heart, you have to be a good person. You gotta treat people the way you want to be treated. I don’t want to be an ass to you and then expect that you treat me nice. My whole thing is, for music, I always think of myself ... It’s funny, sometimes I’ll go somewhere where they be like, “Man, Sleepy Brown,” and they be like, “You ain’t acting like no star.” I’m like, “No,” because to me it’s music. I love the fact that people love the music that I’m doing, but I can’t let it get to my head and walk around like ... Because then I’ll block my blessings. Audience Member I feel that your more behind the scenes, right? Your the producer, obviously. Your making these beats, making it possible for people like Outkast, paved that way for them. I don’t know necessarily how it works financially, but in the limelight, they are the ones, they are the faces of what you’ve produced, right? Sleepy Brown Mm-hmm (affirmative). Audience Member Do you see that they may be ... Because I don’t see Outkast coming to an event like this. Sleepy Brown Oh no. They would. Audience Member They would? Sleepy Brown Yeah. I’m going to tell you like this. Dre is a little different. He’s more to himself. That’s why we always give him space, and let him do him. I can’t really say for Dre, but I know Big would in a heartbeat. I love Big Boi. If you want to meet somebody super humble, meet Big Boi. It’s ridiculous. I know he would be here. Time he found out what I was doing, he been posting on Instagram all day. That’s all he do. Audience Member What was one of the more fun songs that you recorded? What was your favorite? You know, you just had fun in the studio, it just came to you? On the flip side, what was the worst song? You know, that just took you forever to actually record it? Sleepy Brown Took forever to do it. The best song, I’ll have to say, it was a song I produced with Joi. It was called “Lick.” If you haven’t heard it, look that one up. It was in a couple of movies. That was a real fun and sexy record. The hardest record? Wow. I don’t know. That’s a good question, because if you know what? If it becomes too hard, I won’t do it. It has to be that, I have to feel like this is going. Sometimes you want to work for something to see if it will work out. But if it’s just now there? If it gets to that point, I’ll just be like, just go somewhere else. That’s kind of what it is, if that answers your question, if that was good. Audience Member I’m curious about, kind of that transition ... You’re in the studio, the sound sounds great, you can get it just the way you want it. Now you got to go out and deliver it live, in front of all these people. How do you translate that vision in the studio to the stage, and what are some of the things you’re thinking about when you’re making that plan about how I’m going to execute this on stage? Do you have any rituals that you go through before you hit the stage? What’s that process like? Sleepy Brown That’s a great question. As far as the show, I think it’s just about that feeling. Sometimes you’re not going to be able to get those same drums, because it might have been a drum machine. I don’t too much want to put the drum machine on stage with the band, because the one thing about Sleepy Theme’s band is that, that’s the great thing about it, is that groove of them playing live. They set they own tempo to it, you know what I mean? I think with that, it was just about us ... I want to make sure that everybody else play what they suppose to play to make it really come across. As far as rituals, I just kick everybody out, and then look in the mirror and be like, “You gonna do this! Who gonna do this? You Brown! Show them what you do Brown, come on Brown!” Then I turn around and walk out. Audience Member I watched the Organized Noize documentary actually, on Netflix, it was pretty good. What I got from that is that you guys were a real family, the Dungeon Family, the crew. What kind of advice would you give to young guys trying to make their own crew? How do you handle situations where you have many artists? Like you guys, you have Outkast and Goodie Mob at the same time, how did you handle situations like that? How come Goodie Mob didn’t feel like, “Why did we not come out first,” and all this? I’ve worked for a lot of people, and these situations always come through. Sleepy Brown Actually Goodie Mob weren’t together, when we first did “Player’s Ball”. That kind of came after. What it was, Gipp was a solo artist, CeeLo was a solo artist, and Khujo and T-Mo were a group called the Lumberjacks. That’s how that was. Then Rico was like, “Why don’t we just put y’all together as a group, and we’ll do it like this.” I don’t know if it would have been a problem, because it really wasn’t a problem. They knew that we wanted to make Outkast the first ones to set the whole trend up, so what that deal was, on that Southernplayalistic album, if you listen to it, every song is not just us, it’s everybody’s ideas. We’re all in the studio. Like CeeLo went in, Ray was doing a beat, CeeLo went in, did a verse that became “Get Up, Get Out, Get Some”. You know what I’m saying? That first album was really a Dungeon Family album. Truthfully. Outkast was just the face of it. Everybody’s ideas, that was definitely a Dungeon family album. As far as you trying to put a crew together, if everyone has the same love for what they want, and they see it over there all together, it works. If anybody look over here, look over there, they ain’t supposed to be in the crew, because they only looking out for themselves. We always looked out for each other. Period. Audience Member I’m a producer, so I have a couple production questions. I recall you mentioning Dr. Dre, and I remember when I went back and listened to Southernplayalistic album, and I was listening to The Chronic around that same time, to me some of the aspects of Southernplayalistic production wise, it felt like Atlanta’s answer to The Chronic. Sleepy Brown Absolutely. Audience Member What influence did The Chronic have on Southernplayalistic? My second question is what type of drum machines and instruments did you guys use on Soul Food, because to me, out of all the releases, it felt the most raw. Sleepy Brown Right. Okay, so, Soul Food was the SP 1200. You can tell how the bass … drum sound crunchy, yeah. So that’s the SP 12, MP 60, was mainly our main drum machines. As far as the first question, what’s funny is, I remember when The Chronic was coming out, and our record store Super Sounds had it a day early. We went and picked it up, because we knew for some reason that that album was going to be bad because we were already Dr. Dre fans. Period. We played it, and we listened to that whole album. We were like, “You know what? If we want to be seen, we got to be in competition with this. If somebody listens to The Chronic, there’s got to be somebody next to them listening to ours.” You feel me? So that was our main thing. You saying that, that’s exactly what it was. Dre was that, it was that blueprint of showing us how to put an album together. To make it a story. That’s what I like about Dre. He would have breaks, he would, you know what I’m saying? You would swear you were watching a movie when you were listening to that album, just from beginning to end. That’s how we want to do. For sure. Audience Member Piggybacking off of the production, would you say is the difference between a beat, versus okay, this is a production? Sleepy Brown I think more production, from what it’s supposed to stand for, is more instruments I would say. A lot of people don’t think that just a beat is a fully produced song. It is these days. It doesn’t take a lot, what’s nice these days is that how simple stuff is, and how raw it is, and how it’s only a kick and the snare, and then this one sound. This little eerie sound. That sets the whole groove. These days I think those kind of beats are well produced records too. They’re not easy to do. What Metro Boomin and ‘em doing, that ain’t easy to do, you just can’t go in there and think you’re going to do what they be, because it’s not like that. I really look up to a lot of producers these days, I like them man. I think what they doing is really fly. How they taking Fruity Loops and flipping it, and Ableton and doing this, because I don’t even know how to work Ableton yet. That’s what I want to learn how to work. I heard that is insane. I work with the Maschine, and the Native Instruments, I love Native Instruments, and all this stuff. Audience Member You mentioned the SP 1200, why was that the instrument? Sleepy Brown That was the one drum machine where it could take your drums and make them sound dirty like an old record. It really made it sound hip-hop. It almost really messed your sample up. Sonics on it were just like, “Woo,” like, “Ooh, that sounds nasty,” you know what I mean? If you put an 808, it don’t just go boom, it goes brrr. It buzzed you know what I mean? That’s what it is. Audience Member Tomorrow night? I was just wondering if you could talk about who’s playing, and what the setup is? Just like, talking just about how you approached what you want to do. This is first time you’re playing this album. Sleepy Brown Yeah, yeah. Actually not the first time we’re playing the album, but, in a long time. I got all the original players. Vic, Victor Cortes is on drums man. I call him Bigfoot, because he’s big, he’s just, you know, he’s heavy. Omar the percussionist. We’re basically just going to take the album and shake it up, put it in a box and shake it up and go ... Put our list in like, instead of doing it just like the album. I’m real excited about doing it. It’s going to be fun. Audience Member I know you have the Organized Noize reunion coming up next month for the One Music Fest. I just wanted to know what prompted you all to get back together? Sleepy Brown They called us man. It was something that we wanted to do, but there’s a lot of us man. It’s kind of hard to arrange that when Big might have a certain schedule, CeeLo got a certain schedule. It’s all about, just so happened this schedule came together. By blessing it came together. I was shocked. Like, “We gonna do it.” I was like, “We are? Okay.” I’m excited, this is a long time we haven’t done this. This is actually the first time we’ve ever performed the Dungeon Family album. We’ve never done this. It was just, man. Everything lined up right, that’s all I can say. Christina Lee Since the documentary was brought up, there’s an album to go along with it, right, The Art of Organized Noize? What’s the status of that right now? Sleepy Brown It’s being mixed right now. We actually, the song they’re going to make the first single is called “Pass The Kush”. It’s featuring Joi. It’s so raw and dub-funky, it’s ridiculous. I’m excited about that one. Christina Lee Who else is going to be featured? Sleepy Brown Well, me and Joi just kind of basically doing songs on there together. We’re going to put out volumes of the album, the second album is going to be more guest stars from people and stuff like that. This one is more instrumentals. This album, an artist can take the instrumental and do something, whatever they want to, because it’s going to be some instrumental, feeling the vibe on it. You can do something to it, whatever. We also are going to have songs on there, too, singing songs. Christina Lee That must have been really exciting to reunite with Joi. Sleepy Brown Oh yeah, that’s my sister. That’s my Aquarius sister. Her birthday is the next day after mine, so we just alike. We silly and everything. She’s always, I can just called her and be like, “Yo I got this beat.” Send it to me. Then she’ll write something to it. It’s that simple with Joi. Christina Lee Awesome. The final question I had was in regards to The Vinyl Room. Do you have plans to reissue the album? Sleepy Brown It’s actually up right now on iTunes. I didn’t say that though, but, it’s on iTunes. Christina Lee That’s okay though, I’m sure people are going to want to know how they can listen to it. Sleepy Brown Yeah, yeah, please do y’all. Christina Lee This was a really great conversation, really great lecture. Sleepy Brown Yeah it was nice. I had fun. Christina Lee Give it up for Sleepy Brown guys.

Title: Tullio De Piscopo

Tullio De Piscopo
Born in a family of drummers in Naples, Tullio De Piscopo learned the ropes of the business early before moving north to Milan, where he established himself as an in-demand session drummer, nicknamed “The Surgeon.” His contributions over that period established him as a prolific drummer in Italy, keeping rhythm for local and international artists such as Chet Baker, Aldemaro Romero, Fausto Pappeti and Astor Piazzolla. During that time he also formed one of the country’s top rhythm sections with bassist Pino Presti. In the ’70s and ’80s he found success with fellow Neapolitan Pino Daniele, including the international hit “Stop Bajon (Primavera),” before coming into his own as a singer with “Andamento Lento.”
In this lecture at the Red Bull Music Academy Bass Camp Rome 2017, De Piscopo retraced the steps of a remarkable career that took him out of Naples and onto stages around the world. Along the way he also shares stories about introducing drums to Argentinian tango and writing pop songs in a taxi.
Hosted by David Nerattini Today we are here for lecture that makes me particularly proud and also a little nervous because this isn’t something you do every day. For years, I grew up with the certainty that THE drummer in Italy was Tullio De Piscopo. Before we ask him to talk, I think we should ask him to do what comes most naturally and play us something. Please maestro, Tullio De Piscopo. (music: Live drum improvisation / applause) What an honor, what a pleasure to meet you. Well, I’ve already described you as a generous musician, a mainstream star and the favorite drummer of other Italian drummers and musicians but I would like to start from the very beginning, I would like to talk about the young Tullio De Piscopo, who became enchanted by the drums because there were already two other drummers in the house. Tullio de Piscopo Yes, both my father and my brother Romeo played drums. Some people are born in a shirt but I was pretty much born with drumsticks in hand. As soon as I opened my eyes, I saw drums, tambourines, cymbals and percussion instruments and I have always known that this is what I had to do. They used to call us the “crazy family,” in Porta Capuana, the historic neighborhood of Naples, because at 7:30 my dad would start off with a drum roll on the snare drum with a rubber pad before moving onto the xylophone and vibrato, then my brother Romeo would start. Then they would leave to go to the galleria to look for work. You had to go to Galleria Umberto because that’s where you find work. We didn’t have a telephone, so how would they get hired otherwise? In galleria. You went down there and it was, “Hey, how are you? Are you free on…” The first thing to ask for was a retainer, we’re talking about 500-1,000 Lire. So, I started when they left and I started to play and it was there that the only person in the world, still today, ever paid me to stop playing. It was Mrs. Concetta who lived next door. Our houses were only divided by a plasterboard wall and she would say, “Tullio, you’re a good boy. I’ll give you 50 Lire if you stop playing, it gives me a headache.” So, I would take the 50 lire but then I invented something extremely useful. I took a green military cover, which my mum must have got for me from the American market, and I draped it over the whole drumkit including the cymbals. It wasn’t a drumkit like this one [points to drumkit], it was smaller and there was only one cymbal. And I started to study that way. I could barely see anything, it was a table, you couldn’t see the spaces but studying that way meant I can now play with my eyes closed. I know where my hands have to go. I told my dad the same thing so he covered his xylophone and it was really useful. So, Mrs. Concetta may have paid me not to play, but she also did me a big favor! David Nerattini So how did you become professional? You must have played in Naples at the beginning? What kind of work was there for a young drummer? Tullio de Piscopo It’s a crazy story because my dad didn’t want me to play the drums. “You have to play the double bass! You have to study the double bass because there are no good double bassists in Italy.” “Whatever you say.” I was 11 years old. He made me go to lessons with a teacher in San Carlo in Naples, but we didn’t pay of course so whenever I got to the teacher’s house in the Spanish quarter, it was on the eighth floor without a lift, he was always annoyed because he gave me lessons for free. I would listen and have a go on his instrument. Then when I got home I would practice on a broom using a drumstick as the bow, sat in front of the mirror humming [imitates bow movement]. My teacher would tell me that I had to buy a double bass to study. When I told my dad that we had to buy the double bass he asked me where I thought he’d get the money from. So, it was lucky for me that we had no money to buy one and so I was able to play the drums. David Nerattini We might have had a great double bassist by now! Tullio de Piscopo Who knows, the drums are better. David Nerattini You’re right. So how did you move into the professional world? With an orchestra? Tullio de Piscopo No, it all started with parties because we played in people’s homes at christenings, weddings‚ not at funerals! David Nerattini Those just in New Orleans. Tullio de Piscopo We mostly played at weddings. There were owners who had a big hall and would rent it out for weddings. Then the catering staff would come in, in the poor neighborhoods of Naples, that’s how I started. David Nerattini It was usual back then to move forward playing with orchestras, big or small. Tullio de Piscopo Yes, we played in the night clubs next to the Port of Naples like everyone, like Pino Daniele. These places were full of Americans who came in with the fleet. They would disembark at Piazza Municipio and the owners would call us, “Hurry, hurry, the Americans are here!” So, then we played from two in the afternoon until midnight, one until the Marine police arrived, beat everyone up and dragged them off drunk. It was a great lesson for us all because we all had to learn the international repertoire from a real book. You had to know the pieces they asked for, American or foreign. David Nerattini Then at some point you had to realize that it wasn’t enough to stay in Naples, if you wanted to be a professional drummer there were two places back then: Milan or Rome. Rome had RAI, so the RAI orchestra, cinema, meaning soundtracks, and what else? Little else. And the RCA, so so some pop music, but not much more. Tullio de Piscopo There was the social life, but I wasn’t cut for it. I knew exactly what I had to do. I had to play the drums in a certain way and make money more than anything, because I came from extreme poverty. But why did I leave Naples? Because I began to take off, everybody wanted me in the recording studio. Just think, I recorded with Sergio Bruni, who was the voice of Naples. But then people started up with some bad talking, “What can he do with the drums that I can’t? He only works because he’s Peppino De Piscopo’s son.” I gave it all up, took my drums and a record player and hopped on the train. First stop Rome, I didn’t like it. Next stop Bologna, great, jazz but no work. That’s how I began to work out where to go: Milan, Bergamo, Verona, Turin, Novara, Vercelli. Here it is going to be hard. I chose Milan so I could play jazz and it was the right position for me in the world of music although I struggled at the beginning because I was different. David Nerattini I can imagine that a young Neapolitan lad didn’t get the best welcome in Milan back then. Tullio de Piscopo A southern boy. David Nerattini The welcome in Milan was probably not the best. Tullio de Piscopo In the meanwhile, I had gotten married and my wife was pregnant. So, I took a few steps backward in order to stay in Milan, I played in a night club where I earned 7,000 Lire a day. My wife and I were staying in a boarding house called Do Re Mi, seriously. It cost 7,500 Lire a day with a meal. David Nerattini So, you were down by 500 Lire. Tullio de Piscopo That’s right, I was 500 Lire in debt every day. Sometimes I’d work until 5, 6 or 7 in the morning. In the mornings, my wife looked for apartments in the newspapers and often got an appointment, she is from the north so they heard her Emilian accent from Sassuolo, then we’d go together in the afternoon and as soon as they heard me speak they’d say, “We’re sorry, we’ve promised the apartment to someone else, someone’s called.” My wife and I went all round Milan, all the way down Via Ripamonti, Via Mirabella. And there we saw a sign saying, “We don’t rent to southerners.” I looked at my northern wife and said, “Now what the hell are we going to do?” We don’t rent to southerners! How absurd. What do they write now I wonder? David Nerattini Now they would write, “We don’t rent to immigrants!” Tullio de Piscopo Now there is nothing written. Now they don’t rent it at all. We pay them. So, I told my wife to go back to Sassuolo, I would stay and look. Luckily, I found an apartment but outside Milan, in the Zingone neighborhood in Trezzano sul Naviglio! Unbelievable. David Nerattini And did you have to go to the galleria to find work in Milan as well? Tullio de Piscopo No, but having a phone was very important to me. It was tricky to get a phone back then, but I got one after a month. My number was 4471424. David Nerattini You still remember your number! Tullio de Piscopo Of course! My mum played it on the lottery and she even won! [laughter] So I slowly settled in, but what was my plan? I wanted to become the drummer for everybody, on every single record. I didn’t want to play live with a singer, only records. In fact, you know well how many LPs I’ve done, how many recordings… David Nerattini Until Pino, you had practically never played live with a singer. Tullio de Piscopo Only Pino, I only toured with Pino. David Nerattini So, throughout the ’70s, three records came out a day. Tullio de Piscopo I recorded for everybody, Celentano and Mina, and of course they all asked me to play on their tours. I never said yes. Only to Pino Daniele because we had a connection. David Nerattini How did you manage to break into the world of session recording in Milan? Did you have to prove how good you were? Tullio de Piscopo It was tough because it was a war against the other drummers and other musicians. David Nerattini I can imagine! Tullio de Piscopo Because I was from Naples. But I managed eventually. Until one day I was called for a recording that went [hums the melody] There were incredible drums there and everyone was asking, “Who is that? Who’s making those sounds? Who’s playing the drums?” Suddenly they all wanted that drummer and then they realized that it was a drummer from Porta Capuana in Naples. David Nerattini If you go onto Discogs and click to see all the albums as an exercise, they’re not all there of course,
but a lot of them are listed, the first that appears is from Aldemaro Romero Y Su Onda Nueva, La Onda Maxima. Tullio de Piscopo Aldemaro Romero from Caracas was a great musician, extraordinary, who invented this new genre, onda nueva, a sort of bossa nova but in 3/4. There’s a good story behind onda nueva as well. David Nerattini Were you only Italian musicians or mixed? Tullio de Piscopo A mix, but it was when I had just arrived in Milan so they hadn’t called me for this onda nueva, this new tricky rhythm that was very difficult. They had refused three drummers and the orchestra was just waiting for a drummer to make the cut. Then one of them, his name was Nebuloni, said, “Let’s call this Neapolitan that’s just come to Milan.” They called me and I went at 21:00 to this Mondial Sound studio. The whole orchestra was there with the conductor. I took a while to set up my drum kit so I could check the score. Neapolitan style, you know? It had been annotated by the other drummers as well. “So, are you ready?” “Yes, yes, I’m coming.” “Ok!” (music: Aldemaro Romero y su Onda Nueva – “Onda Maxima”) We did the piece and the whole orchestra applauded me when it was finished, “We’ve done it! We’ve finally done it!” [laughter] But it wasn’t easy… David Nerattini Not at all, it changes four times in two minutes! Tullio de Piscopo It wasn’t easy with all those time changes. And I was there messing about so I could read the score. It changes time four times. My strength was being able to read music for drums at first sight. It’s a great skill that I owe to my dad because we used to compete over who read better, him, my brother and me. Even my other brother Antonio would join in! And they always tested me, once they stuck the sheet to the ceiling, upside down and told me, “Read it!” Upside down! It was crazy. So, thanks to this schooling, I can read sheet music at first sight and it’s saved me on numerous occasions! David Nerattini A lot of drummers have missed out on jobs because they weren’t able to read music fast enough. Tullio de Piscopo Exactly, they had a good ear but if you can’t read music in this field, what are you going to do? David Nerattini We’ve already touched on Latin music, which has been something of a constant throughout your career and I dug up these two records... Tullio de Piscopo Oh my god, unreal! David Nerattini Perez Prado. There’s a story behind this... Tullio de Piscopo Perez Prado, incredible! David Nerattini Basically this guy named Perez Prado came to live in Italy, he actually died in Italy, he spent the second half of his life here. This man Perez Prado came here but he was actually the brother of the more famous Perez Prado. His name was really Pantaleon Perez Prado. The two brothers used to play together but then they had a falling out... Tullio de Piscopo They were twins. David Nerattini Twins. Because Perez Prado was actually their surname! They each had another name. So for some years there were two Perez Prado in the United States, the two brothers. Then at some point they came to an agreement, that one would go to Europe and one would stay in America. “OK, you go to Europe but don’t use the name Perez Prado, add Pantaleon.” Obviously he didn’t, Pantaleon came to Italy and started recording and some of his records are fantastic. Tullio de Piscopo I don’t remember any of that. Just that it was hard work. [looks at the records] Oh, look, incredible! I don’t have these. Are they yours? Amazing. Is the name on there too? (music: Perez Prado – “Circle”) Just think that back then the bass drum was smaller than this [points at drum kit], then there was only one tom-tom, one snare, one timpani, one or sometimes two cymbals and the hi-hat. That was it. But I remember this drumkit, my first kit bought on credit in my father’s name, was bought from Alfredo Ceruti in Via Arenaccia. I spent 2,000 Lire a month in repayments and I did everything with that kit, I made history. I had got it ready. I removed the leather, this leather [points to bass drum], from the bass drum and put the microphone inside so that the sound was ready. That’s why the techies helped me too, they all wanted me. They turned on the mic and that was it! It played, the sound was there. David Nerattini So, in just a few years you became THE drummer in Milan, the one they said to call if a track wasn’t going right, and even the “record fixer.” Tullio de Piscopo Very good, how did you know that? David Nerattini It’s quite well known! Tullio de Piscopo They used to call me the surgeon‚ “Call the surgeon.” “Who’s this surgeon?” “Here’s his number, call him.” Because once in a while, a new drummer would arrive in Milan and outdo Tullio De Piscopo. Somone who destroyed Tullio De Piscopo. I’d wait a month but the phone had stopped ringing. They would record with this guy and then I had to go and redo it all because the techies refused to mix it. “I can’t mix this track with this drummer. What are we going to do? We need the surgeon.” So, I went along and I’d sort it out in two minutes. With the tempo changing constantly. We’re talking about famous drummers too. David Nerattini Right, because there was a new feature that began to emerge in the ’70s. There were no click tracks before, so you were the human click. Tullio de Piscopo No, there were definitely no click tracks. David Nerattini You were the human click during recordings. Tullio de Piscopo Sometimes they would use an actual metronome, the old metronome, they wanted me but I was busy so they used this metronome as the guide track and then I came in, sometimes even at two in the morning and I played the drums over the metronome and the guide track. David Nerattini If there’s one thing that’s hard about studio recording as a drummer, it’s playing when everybody else has already played. It’s the hardest thing. Tullio de Piscopo It’s hard. I made an entire LP which actually went very well for Christian De Sica which went [mimics rhythm] Do you have that one? David Nerattini No. Tullio de Piscopo I did it all alone, it was crazy. Then they added the others. The whole orchestra with the great conductor Gianni Ferri. But going back to what you said before about the metronome, it was difficult. Once I went to record and in the studio was the great Vinicius De Moraes, Nobel prize winner in literature [ed note: de Moraes never won the Nobel prize], as well as Toquinho, this Brazilian artist. The LP was Arca di Noé and the track was called “[O Relògio] Tic Tac,” written by Vinicius and Toquinho. The arranger came in and I saw that they had put a small table in front of the booth, because the drum kit was closed away in a glass room so that it wasn’t picked up by the other mics. Do you know what I mean? They placed this small table in front of the glass and the conductor laughed. What the hell are you laughing at? And they placed this metronome on it. And the conductor wanted to have a laugh. “The track is called “Tic Tac,” you have to follow the metronome.” “Well, I can do it, if none of you play.” It went like this, they were in a rush. “If you don’t play, how long’s the piece?” “Three minutes? I’ll do it in three minutes.” (music: Vinicius De Moraes – “O Relògio (aka Tic Tac)” live) And from the booth, I watched Vinicius de Moraes moving like this [swings in time], with a full glass of whisky and he didn’t spill a drop. What an experience. The musicians always dashed off at the end of each session, they never gave me a hand. I had to dismantle my drum kit and load it into my car. That day, Nobel prize winner Vinicius De Moraes loaded my drum kit into the car for me. Incredible, incredible. I had a Fiat 500, with the seats taken out because they got nicked otherwise. David Nerattini The bassist is always important for a drummer because they’re your twin, as it were. There were bassists that you particularly liked in those years, they appear on many records. Two in particular come to mind, one of whom went on to become an arranger and producer, Giuseppe Prestipino. Tullio de Piscopo He arranged Mina as well. David Nerattini His artist name was Pino Presti, and you formed a lethal duo. Then, sometime later, an extraordinary bassist moved to Italy from New Orleans, where he had played with the very best local musicians‚ Allen Toussaint, the Neville Brothers. Basically he was one of the great bassists of New Orleans and I never understood why he moved to Italy. Perhaps you can help me. What was he thinking? Tullio de Piscopo Julius Farmer. David Nerattini Julius Farmer, an incredible bassist. Tullio de Piscopo Well, Giorgio Caslini, who was a great jazz musician back then, went to play at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. So they got him the best bassist in town, Julius Farmer, and drummer John Vidagovic. Then Giorgio Caslini liked them so much that he invited them to do some festivals in Italy. Vidagovic left after a while, he went back to New Orleans, but Julius liked Italy, the food was so good, so he stayed. And I helped him with the solfege, because he couldn’t read music very well. He had never had the training that I had, as I told you before, but he had me and at first I helped him. He sat right outside the booth playing his bass live without an amp and I would signal when he had to stop. “Stop!” He followed my directions. Then I gave him this book, a book of tricks for learning solfege, but I can’t tell you what it’s called. David Nerattini There are lots of records that don’t mention your name and I’ve always wondered... By ear, I’d say it’s you. Tullio de Piscopo I made 30. David Nerattini So, this [holds record] must be one of them. Tullio de Piscopo 30 collected albums, because the great Fausto Papetti made two a year. But they don’t even know who Fausto Papetti is. David Nerattini Anyone who has bought vinyl in Italy will have come across Fausto Papetti records sooner or later. (music: Fausto Papetti – “Love’s Theme”) Tullio de Piscopo Fausto Papetti was always top of the charts, not only in Italy but all over the world. He released two LPs a year and they went to the top of the charts as soon as they came out. The first time I went to New York, I went to the Village Vanguard, a jazz club, to hear the jazz musicians. It was amazing, Billy Hart was on the drums. Afterwards, I went to Billy and said, “Can you recommend some record shops where you all get your jazz records from?” “Oh yeah, there’s a small shop between seventh and eighth.” I woke up the next morning, headed to the shop, looked in the window... Fausto Papetti. The record that I had just made. Can you believe it? He was a revered in Japan, a god, but he never went. He never went, because he was scared of flying. What a person, incredible. David Nerattini After Fausto Papetti’s success, everyone tried to copy him in Italy. Every label had its Fausto Papetti. Tullio de Piscopo But nobody got it right. David Nerattini No, well, George Saxon. Tullio de Piscopo I played on those records too. David Nerattini You can tell. So, we’ve got to ’77, ’78 going back and forth a bit. And synthesizers begin to emerge in pop music and we were talking about the click track earlier. Suddenly you had to be able to play along with something that kept perfect time, well, more or less, they didn’t go perfectly back then, there was some latency, it wasn’t easy. Tullio de Piscopo There was the famous Korg. David Nerattini They began to call you for albums made with synths and keyboards where the only human element was you on the drums. Was this because of your metronomic precision and your ability to play a groove as though you were an electric drum kit but better? As precise as an electric drum kit but groovy like a drummer. Tullio de Piscopo Erm, I don’t know. David Nerattini Well, that’s what I think, I stand by it. And I’ll back my statement with this track, taken from the 1978 record by Il Guardiano del Faro. Tullio de Piscopo Wow, this guy knows everything! David Nerattini Federico Monti Arduini. Tullio de Piscopo This guy’s got the lot! Where do you get these from? I don’t have this. Is my name on there? David Nerattini Yes, here of course. Of course. (music: Il Guardiano Del Faro – “Disco Divina”) What was it like playing with such rigid machines? Because it’s not quite like the metronome, it’s different. Tullio de Piscopo I found it OK, actually I found it better with the machines than with the click track. Because the click track is this electronic metronome playing through your headphones, you’ve got, “Click, click, click,” in your ear, it’s crazy. You can’t play because it’s distracting. But with the machines, despite being electronic, it was... It was music, it was harmony. Where as the click was just unbearable because you had this metallic sound in your ear and you had to follow it. David Nerattini Yeah, the risk is that you follow the click track more than the music. Tullio de Piscopo There are drummers who play very well with this awful electronic click, but take away that electronic click and they don’t know how to play. It’s a prison, you know? David Nerattini They only know how to play with guide rails. The pros and cons of modernity. Ideally, you’d want to be a real drummer who was precise enough not to... Tullio de Piscopo The great thing about Pino Presti was with Piazzolla. David Nerattini Exactly, that’s exactly where I was going. We’ve talked about pop music and dance music, your actual work as it were. But you had come to Milan to play the music you liked, jazz. Tullio de Piscopo I worked on all these records to survive, to look after my family, and I played jazz in the evenings but it wasn’t well paid. I always played in the evening, always. There was a new venue called Jazz Power, which was where Motta is in Milan, in Piazza Duomo. Or I went to play in Turin but I always came back the same night because I had to record in the morning. So, it was a life of sacrifice as well, but I had to do it. David Nerattini In addition to the jazz, there were other collaborations where you actually developed further, even getting involved in the arrangement itself. Because the drummer can’t always have a say in the arrangement, but in some cases... I’m talking about your collaboration in the ’70s with the great Astor Piazzolla. Not only the king of Argentinian tango, but the person who completely reshaped this ancient genre, who modernized it. This was all on an album... Tullio de Piscopo All you need to do is play the music and they’ll know who we’re talking about. David Nerattini It’s one of those things that as soon as you hear it... Tullio de Piscopo The famous “Libertango,” which is still played by all the great orchestras in theatres around the world. If you pay attention, you’ll notice that everybody who plays “Libertango” is going too fast. I don’t know where they’re rushing off to. “Where are you going?” This is the right time. I’ll play you the original. From ‘74 to 2017 in the villa, wow. (music: Astor Piazzolla – “Libertango” live) Every melody has its tempo. David Nerattini Of course, and here, the secret is in raising the hi-hat, in my opinion. Tullio de Piscopo The best thing about this was the phone call from the union. “Hello De Piscopo, are you free on April 22nd and 23rd?” “Yes, where?” “Mondial Sound, Rome.” “Ok, who’s playing?” Boom, they had already hung up. So, I called back and said that’s not the way to do things. “Who am I playing with? What do I have to do? What style of music is it?” “Oh, I don’t know, some accordion player.” “What’s his name?” “Astor Piazzolla.” The maestro Astor Piazzolla arrives, oh, he was a sight. “Hello, hello.” He’s from Argentina. Guitar... Presti Pino on the bass... Piano... 11 pages of piano music, it was all black... Timpani, guitars, flutes in E, flutes in C, drums... There was nothing for drums, just the odd rhythmic. “Excuse me, there’s not much written here.” “I know, I’ve never used the drums.” “Ok, but I need to hear something.” So, he reaches for this battered wooden box and pulls out this toy, this bandoneon. He sits right there and starts making these arcs in the air. I start to play, telling him to go on. I ask for headphones and go into the booth and play eight bars. And he says, “Esto es, stop, esto es libertango.” And that’s the music we all know. And who would ever have thought it would be a global hit? I became famous in Argentina because tango had never had drums in it before. David Nerattini Then we get to a certain turning point where your career changed. As a pure drummer and jazz musician of a certain kind, you meet Pino, you meet him again, it wasn’t the first time, you’d known him for ages, and finally collaborate with him on the album that really cemented his fame. He was already big but he still hadn’t realized his maximum success. Let’s listen a a bit of it, it’s always good. Such an amazing groove. This is an original copy, I bought it in those years. (music: Pino Daniele – “Yes I Know My Way” / applause) This is the history of Italian music. Tullio de Piscopo It still gets emotional when I listen to Pino. We had an extraordinary connection. David Nerattini It really felt like you were made for each other, it was a magical group. You fit together perfectly in terms of personality, with the instruments, everything. Tullio de Piscopo There’s already such personality in this first track off the LP, without copying anybody. This precise sound of Naples and Pino Daniele, you know? Pino Daniele, great poet, great musician, great guitarist. He could do it all and he wrote it all in dialect. If myself or Lucariello or any other Neapolitan artist wants to write something in dialect, we have to check whether he’s done it first. The word “Appocundria” (apathy) became part of our vocabulary. Then from here it was ever upwards. Basically, this is how it started, the book mentions it. I met Pino through my father, he played the xylophone and vibrato in the orchestra for Senza Rete, a Friday night live TV show. And Pino went to sing “Napulè” and “Madonna Mia.” So, my father called me and said, “You have to hear this guy, he’s excellent.” “Who is it? What’s his name?” “He’s a great, his name is Pino Daniele.” “I’m certain I’ll meet him.” A bit later we spoke on the phone because they wanted me to listen to his first work, Terra Mia. Then we met, I was in Milan and he was in Naples, we met at midday on December 28th, 1977 at the Port’Alba Pizzeria in Naples and we never left each other. We were always in harmony, even when we were far apart. David Nerattini Quite rightly, you became the most feared group in Italy over those years. It was difficult to play anywhere after you. A mix of groove technique, feel... Tullio de Piscopo There was a sound, there was a reason. There was no soloist, we were all there to serve Pino and his poetry. David Nerattini You all did so in the best way possible and this triggered a series of events, which were really positive for everybody in this photo [holds album], after this record and this tour. You all stepped up a level, Nino Esposito and yourself had both already made loads of records but this experience gave you a new audience. Tullio de Piscopo I left Milan and went to live where he was in Formia. We built an apartment above the studio, there was nothing there before, and we played all day long. We’d make coffee and step outside the studio, which was on the ground floor, to smoke a cigarette and then head back in. We played from 10:00 until midnight. It was crazy. So many tracks in the archive and I’ve heard so many grooves from the archive in tracks he made when we were apart. I’ve heard things we’ve done together in the tracks he’s made. Who knows where all those recordings went, we had a technician who recorded us. I don’t know who has them, they were extraordinary, I’d love to listen to it all again. David Nerattini Who knows who has them? Tullio de Piscopo I think probably Warner at this point. David Nerattini Do you think so? They got the lot? After the great success of this record, even though this was already a later phase in which it was no longer just you guys but there were also stars from America on the records, but it was this record, Sciò, and the tour that followed that changed your profile a bit. To the point that, you as a drummer, emerged as a singer. How did that happen? Tullio de Piscopo I had already done some vocal experiments in volume 2, after “A Cozzeca.” “A Cozzeca,” which began to add words to the percussion. I hadn’t ever opened my mouth before then. I started adding words to the percussion. I began to sing on the next LP with “Semplicità,” do you remember? [sings] Then there was Acqua e Viento produced and arranged by Pino Daniele and we did the track “Stop Bajon (Primavera).” (music: Tullio de Piscopo – “Stop Bajon (Primavera)”) David Nerattini You were telling me how this track can easily be danced to in 4/4, but is actually divided into seven. Tullio de Piscopo Yes, by seven, it’s not even. When Pino played me this sequence, I thought, “Damn, it’s not even.” This was Pino’s genius, it’s not even but you don’t notice. Only the musician notices. The track came out with my rhythm, the bajon that my father taught me, which I then gave to Adriano Celentano. And so, this sequence was born from this rhythm, written in seven. It was beautiful. This was Pino’s genius. David Nerattini What’s interesting is that this track became a big hit, I think it was one of the few pop songs on which Don Cherry played. The trumpet riff is one of the things that really sticks with you from the track. All of a sudden, you were a singer. Tullio de Piscopo You don’t understand, it was all a joke. “Damn, I should have started singing earlier instead of waiting until I was 35 years old and still drinking Folonari.” [laughter] After that I moved on to Moet Chandon, Dom Perignon, fine steaks... But we have to remember that I have been driving a Fiat 500 all my life. They stole my seats but I didn’t mind, it meant I could load the drums where the passenger seat would have been. The great master Renato Sellani sat behind while I drove but I didn’t have any seats. I had a tom-tom case, a rigid drum case, and I sat on it because I couldn’t find any original seats at the scrapyard. Finally, I found a seat from the 600 but I asked for it without the passenger seat so I could still fit the drums in. Then I added the luggage rack for when I travelled with my family. David Nerattini The 500, I can’t believe it. And then you became a singer and you went to Sanremo the very next year. Tullio de Piscopo I didn’t think I was right for Sanremo, I had already been playing in the orchestra. The evenings started back then to incredible success, I made a bit of money and then came another great record, Passaggio da Oriente, but we had split from Pino and the producer as well, we had divided the editorial parts. It was then that we made the song “E fatto ‘e Sorde! E?” dedicated to everybody who thinks they’re it, but really they’re nothing. Another hit. And then came the extraordinary success of “Andamento Lento.” David Nerattini Which became a classic Italian pop song. Tullio de Piscopo I was at Fiumicino Airport and I bumped into Marco Ravera, the head of Sanremo Festival and son of the great Gianna Ravera, who said, “Go on Tullio, make a song for Sanremo.” I answered, “Marco, do I look like a Sanremo artist?” “No! Just do what you do, come on!” So, I told my producer and we started looking for tracks by other people. This is an interesting story of how a hit is born. We found the Capuano brothers, who had a series of tracks. David Nerattini Enrico and Toni Capuano. Tullio de Piscopo Giosi. We went to see them in December 1987 and I had just got back from Harlem, where we had done a show called “Harlem meets Naples.” David Nerattini You can find it also on Youtube. Tullio de Piscopo With the great [James Brown]. David Nerattini At the Apollo Theatre. Tullio de Piscopo At the Apollo Theatre, and our chorus was the Temptations. David Nerattini It was a meeting of American and Neapolitan musicians. Tullio de Piscopo So, we went to see the Capuano brothers and they started playing us things. The first track was a march, then an excellent track called “Good Time my Friend” from the Bello Carico LP. Willy Deville and the Capuano brothers were lingering over this track which didn’t have a name, it was only called “Good Time my Friend” later. “Let’s do this for Sanremo,” I was saying to wait and play me the first march again, let me hear it again. “Let’s not waste time.” “No no, let me hear the march again.” I said I wanted to work on that and started experimenting with the electric drum kit. There were no lyrics, just you know... [sings mock lyric] David Nerattini A fake lyric. Tullio de Piscopo [sings mock lyric] And nothing... [sings mock lyric] There was nothing written... [sings mock lyric] Pause... [sings mock lyric] Pause... So, I just thought I’ll try. “No!” Willy Deville said I wouldn’t have to write the lyrics. “Why not, doesn’t he want me to earn anything?” And he said we had to find a great lyricist. Ok. So, they found... I can’t name names, the first wasn’t right, the second was even more famous than the first but still wasn’t right. Suddenly we had just 36 hours left until we had to submit the track for Sanremo, by midnight. We decided to meet up and do it all together. “As you wish.” I had already thought of something, I had thought of Bob Marley. We arranged to meet the next day at a house in Ostiense, near Cristoforo Colombo. I called a taxi to Hotel Clodio in Rome, via Santa Lucia. We went round a corner and we were instantly stuck in traffic. The cars were just piling up. “However am I going to get there?” And the taxi driver said, “What can you do, in Rome everything is slow going (andamento lento).” When the eternal father puts his hands... And I immediately thought of a phrase that wasn’t in the recording... [sings] “Andamento lento, andamento lento, andamento...” It was great! He is going to bring me luck. “Look, I don’t need to go to the apartment anymore. How much to Naples?” “Let’s call it four piotte.” “What are piotte?” “400,000 Lire.” “OK, that’s fine.” OK, so as soon as possible I pull over and I call my wife to let her know. Then I told him not to take the motorway because I didn’t like it. We did all the local roads, the Domiziana, the Pontina and the coast road. As soon as we got in the car, I asked if he had a tape player, “Cassette player?” “Yes.” So, I sat up front with a pen, a piece of paper and the tape. We hit the Pontina road. January, the rollers, the waves. [sings] “Scivola... Come un’onda libera mi porta via. Andamento lento questa melodia.” Bob Marley. “Risonanze nere senza ipocrisia.” Then what? “Andare un pò più su. Vieni via con me.” I’d written that at first and not “Vieni vieni.” “Vieni via con me.” Pause. “Vieni via con me.” Pause. Then what? “Vieni appresso a me.” It worked! It was finished by the time we got to Naples. “Now where?” “Don’t worry, go here, turn there.” And I took him for a pizza in Santa Lucia. Then I said, “Let’s go to Porta Capuana, we’ll have a nice lemonade and soda.” And then I went to say hello to my mother on the first floor. She was sleeping, but I played her the track and she said, “Beautiful, my love. This song will reward you. What will you call it?” “Andamento Lento.” “Perfect.” Bye and good night. Then the next day everyone was looking for me, we had a meeting at 3:00 pm. I’d disappeared and there were no phones. But otherwise we’d never have had that song. Then in the hotel I didn’t like “Vieni via con me” anymore, so I repeated “Vieni vieni, Vieni vieni.” “Vieni via con’, Vieni via” wasn’t bad but too Italian, too Milanese. “Vieni vieni con me,” it was nice! Modugno, “Voooolare.” Modugno made three notes there. “oh oh.” “Vieni vieni con me oh oh, Vieni vieni con me eh oh, alelai alelai alelai vieni appresso a me.” And then what? What about the same but in English? “Show me show me the way oh oh, show me show me the way eh oh,” a global hit [applause]. But I had to change the name then, it couldn’t be “Andamento Lento” anymore, but holy “Andamento Lento,” because I bought a house entirely in cash for my family who deserved a beautiful house. [applause] David Nerattini Of course, it was a turning point. Tullio de Piscopo The best thing was the critics. The critics can’t ever leave you alone. “Yes, but you made “Andamento Lento.”” “So, the hell what? Thank goodness! I don’t know you, who’s next?” Can’t you understand, you critic, that it saved my life? David Nerattini Also it came after having done all this other work. Tullio de Piscopo I’ve done everything! Why did I call it holy “Andamento Lento?” Because it made me rich. There are those who don’t sing their greatest hits, they’re ashamed. I sing it three times a night, three times. And the money just keeps on going up, you know? My fee never falls, it only gets higher. David Nerattini In fact, in recent years... Tullio de Piscopo Remember, it’s how you present yourself. David Nerattini Because the records are selling a bit less, the main thing is going to see a Tullio De Piscopo concert. Ever since you released the triple CD cataloguing your career to celebrate 50 years in the business. Tullio de Piscopo 56 tracks. David Nerattini Your concerts reflect that too so there’s a bit of everything, your hits, your more complex pieces, the jazz... Tullio de Piscopo Music! It’s music, we don’t have labels! They wanted to label me guys. I don’t want labels. I want money! [laughter] Do you understand? It’s crazy talk. Thank god that’s all over. David Nerattini Yes, as you can see with current musicians, the barriers between genres have fallen a bit nowadays, thank goodness. Tullio de Piscopo Yes! But I was joking before. The important thing is to be oneself, good and bad, got it? You can give it up without ever having success, if you know inside yourself that you’ve done something beautiful. Because I’ve been heckled plenty, but who cares! I’m fine, I’ve never done anything, I’ve never stolen anything from the stage, you know? This is the message to give to young people, be honest with yourselves. Play, get your voice out there, even if people don’t like it. They won’t like it now but there will come a moment when they do, for sure. [applause] David Nerattini Well, maestro it’s been amazing, but I think we should finish as we started. Tullio de Piscopo Yes! Can I? David Nerattini Say goodbye with drumsticks in hand, there is no better way. (music: Tullio De Piscopo live improvisation)

Rui Vargas
Rui Vargas has dedicated his life to sharing music with others. As both a radio DJ and the first resident at Lisbon’s Lux Frágil nightclub, where he is also the music director today, Vargas has been entertaining and educating Portuguese audiences for three decades. Known as an ambassador for electronic music within Portugal, Vargas’s dedication to finding and sharing new music remains just as strong as when he first started.
In this public conversation as part of the Lisboa Electronica festival, Vargas detailed the beginnings of his career as a DJ, the impact of pirate radio and the growth of Lisbon’s clubbing and music scene.
Hosted by Aaron Gonsher The person sitting next to me on the couch today is someone... The rare person who is actually deserving of the title of local legend, when it comes to contributions to a specific scene. He’s been DJing for more than 30 years now. Please join me in welcoming Rui Vargas. [applause] So, 30 years is a very long time to be DJing. But to go back even before that first year that you were DJing in front of a crowd, when did you first become aware of DJing as a concept? Of someone standing in front of the audience and mixing together records for the enjoyment of other people? Rui Vargas I didn’t have any notion of what a DJ was until actually I was DJing almost. I didn’t have a goal or a dream to become a DJ. I spent my youth listening to music. Lisbon in the ’70s, Portugal in the ’70s was a monochromatic society, gray, trying to recover from 50 years of dictatorship and 50 years of censorship. We were educated by our parents, by our grandparents, not to get away from the norm, not to deviate from the mainstream. Be humble, be quiet, don’t make any fuss. So that’s more or less what I did. I was very shy. Still am. I was a very shy boy, a few friends. What I did was coming from school, starting to listen to the radio. I was 12 or 13. By then there was Rádio Comercial, a national radio, it was a very important radio and with great shows. All across the board, you could listen in lunch time. Imagine at lunch time you could listen to a program called Discoteca, which was funk, disco and black music overall. And then Rock and Stock, more popular alternative pop. And at night I stopped everything to listen to Som Da Frente, alternative rock, indie radio show that conquered and educated several generations, I believe, of Portuguese people. Made by António Sérgio. He was a major key in my education, I can say that, in my musical upbringing. Everything he would say, it was like God speaking to me directly. That was more or less the important and the importance he transmitted, speaking on a microphone on the radio. And radio always had these magic sides to it. Like, a guy somewhere in the middle of Lisbon, Portugal, I don’t know where, speaking to a microphone, and I’m here listening to it through the air. It still is magic for me every time I think about it. But I started a relationship with radio, with António Sérgio in particular, and listening to everybody and cultivating myself by myself. Aaron Gonsher What was he saying specifically that spoke to you? Rui Vargas First, the wide array of music he showed us, always in high levels of risk. Quality. He was thinking out of the box. He’s considered the Portuguese John Peel. I don’t know. Maybe I prefer António Sérgio to him, because he has this strong, dark... not dark, but low voice, bass voice. Every time he was up on the mic, you would feel like, “Woo.” And he showed me the last punk records, the new age, the post-punk, the first electronic records that I’ve heard. One of them, we could listen to it, because it’s from that era. And also listening to António Sérgio and listening to radio on a constant basis, on a daily basis, it’s also developed my interests and my relationship with the night itself. Because in the night you can listen to all details in the music. You don’t have noise. The radio shows were broadcasted at around midnight, from midnight to two. And I’m talking about Som Da Frente and Rolls Rock before that. At night everything makes more impact and more sense, and that’s also one of the reasons, I believe, I started to live at night and more at night than on a daytime. Aaron Gonsher You were preparing to be a DJ 10 years before you actually became one. Rui Vargas I believe so. Basically I never... And going back to your question, never thought on being a DJ. I didn’t know even what a DJ was by then. But I had this hidden secret will to be a radio presenter. But since I was such a shy guy and with some awkward social behaviors, wasn’t feeling fit in any groups that I knew at school. I developed this imaginary world with music. And until I found a guy. It was in ’84. I remember because we had the same passion with these bands, and he lent a record by Echo & the Bunnymen on ’84. Porcupine, ’83 or ’84. So, I met Zé Pedro Moura, who had a big musical-driven gang. They had bands. They were listening constantly to music together every day, every night. I finally found, “OK, I belong somewhere, and now they are my mates.” I started to hang out with them, and by accident he started also DJing in Frágil, and I started to bring some records and play some records with him. Actually, it was a matter of instead of showing my records to my friends, which I don’t conceive to collect records or buy records to be on a shelf at home. I have to share my records with someone, my family or my friends or someone. Suddenly my friends were not enough, and I started to take my records to a brother audience or a brother circle of friends, and that was the Frágil days maybe, in ’87, ’88. Aaron Gonsher I think we’re gonna talk a lot about Frágil, but for now thinking about you being in that role of sitting around midnight to two in the morning, I wanna play something that might trigger some memories for you of that time, and maybe we can talk about that afterwards. Rui Vargas Shoot. (music: Laurie Anderson – “O Superman”) Now, imagine hearing this for the first time in ’81. Aaron Gonsher What was that? Rui Vargas This is Laurie Anderson. At the time, she was only an avant-garde artist doing performances in New York. It’s one of her first records. It’s a prayer to gods called “O Superman,” and listening to this you could almost realize and believe that Superman existed and God existed and they’re in other planets whatsoever, because it was so far, so alien, this music when you heard it for the first time in the airwaves listening to radio. Aaron Gonsher Do you mean not just something like “O Superman” but something with that sort of electronic mood and sound? Rui Vargas The sound. Yeah, the sound. The sound. Everything made sense because everything is mysterious. Actually, vocoder – which is the kind of instrument that is used here to change the voice – is something that came from the spies to disguise their voices. Spy technology, it’s not musical/technical. Music appropriated the technology to do instruments. It was the first time I heard vocoder. And listening to this for the first time, like I said, was just a kick in the head and opened a whole new world of sound and possibilities for me. Aaron Gonsher You’ve listened to Laurie Anderson. You mentioned Echo & the Bunnymen. How many of these bands that you were listening to, or music in general, did it seem like was coming from outside of Portugal? Or was there still this hangover that you’re describing from the revolution? Rui Vargas Can you repeat that please? Aaron Gonsher Yeah. How much of the music that you were responding to at this time was Portuguese music? Rui Vargas Not a lot. Not a lot, to be fair. There was some bands like ’81, ’82. Heróis do Mar, maybe they had the first album. Carlos Maria Trindade was here yesterday, one of the members of the band. I wasn’t really too interested. The Xutos & Pontapés, of course, they had already one or two singles, but I wasn’t really deep into Portuguese music by that time. Aaron Gonsher When you started DJing, how much of what you were DJing was what would now be considered house music? Or things that were not like Echo & the Bunnymen or Laurie Anderson but... Rui Vargas When I started DJing like back in ’88, there wasn’t like house night or techno night or whatever night. There was music that people could dance to, and you could easily go from the Clash to B-52’s to a dub record to one of the first hip-hop records to Grandmaster Flash or Sugarhill Gang or the first house records coming from Chicago or from Detroit, and it wasn’t strange. Of course, changing BPMs from... I wasn’t really a technical DJ. I was just playing records and following the groove, or trying to. But there wasn’t these barriers where you should be confined when playing music, when playing records. Aaron Gonsher Did you have a specialty at that point? Did you have the one track that you always knew you could reach to when something might be going wrong on the dancefloor, or that you wanted to surprise people with? Rui Vargas I always loved to play B-52’s, the first album by B-52’s or the dub “Magnificent Seven” by Clash or Linton Kwesi Johnson. Or Marshall Jefferson, one of my favorites. It’s also there in your laptop. Aaron Gonsher Just to go back a bit, you said 1988 was when you started DJing in front of an audience. Where was that, and how did you actually get that gig? Rui Vargas Like I said, it’s Zé Pedro, my friend, who still is a resident in Lux. He got this job DJing in Frágil, in old Frágil. I started to come with him and then bring some records with him and play with him, but I wasn’t invited to play there. By then, normally the clubs, they had their own records. The records mostly were not carried by the DJs. The records were there, and the resident DJ would pick up the songs and the records to play and did a set with the house records. Aaron Gonsher Had you been much of a club-goer up to that point in places other than Frágil? What was the scene in Lisbon at the time, in terms of what might have been offering things you were actually interested in from a musical perspective? Rui Vargas The only place for me to go out was the neighborhood Bairro Alto. It was where the places and the kind of music I was interested in at the moment were being played. Places like Frágil, of course, which was more of black music, disco, funk, boogie kind of thing. And then Café Concerto. Or, Sud Ouest. I also was a resident in this place near Frágil called Sud Ouest. I was a resident there for six months in ’88 also. And they were playing new beats, with house, with the alternative rock, and that was the scene at the moment. Aaron Gonsher What distinguished Frágil, then? What made it special? Rui Vargas Everything. First, the idea of going into Frágil was already something that puts you alert and willing to party. Because you never know if you get in the club. I was denied maybe six times before getting inside. And I got inside because of Zé Pedro, because he was working there. It was like, “Am I going to get in or am I not?” Inside, it was like a whole new world, like a shelter for all sorts of people that were thinking out of the box and thinking differently. Creative people, people from arts, whatsoever, from cinema, from newspapers, from theater. And there you could feel safe, and you could be different, and you could speak different things and be yourself without any judgment. Like I said, it was a very conservative society still. I started to go to Frágil maybe in ’86 or something, but it was like a magnet to interesting and nice people and people that were feeling they belonged somewhere in Frágil. People that were strayed around the city, and they found somewhere where they could be themselves without judgment, whatsoever. Freedom. Aaron Gonsher I assume that you’re including yourself in that group, in the sense of being a shy person who went to Frágil and suddenly felt like there was this world here that... Rui Vargas Absolutely. I was already doing radio by then also, professionally. My radio show would end at two o’clock, and every day – every day – I would go from the radio to Frágil without any... I wouldn’t say to anyone that I was going. I was just going. Because I knew that it’s going to be a good night, I will meet interesting people, or my friends will be there. And I would go out every single night from two to four. Aaron Gonsher When had you started working radio professionally then? In 1986, when you started going to Frágil you’d already been doing radio professionally. Rui Vargas Frágil in ’88. Radio professionally in the same year, exactly. I started first in the university radio, pirate radio, first as a technical assistant doing microphone levels and putting commercials, which were broadcasted in cassettes, played, stopped, paused and rewind with a pencil. You had to queue it with a pencil. Then they invited me to participate in one of their shows, and I started to have a show there. Then I started doing professional radio, where I had this slot, first from two to seven at night, one week on, one week off. Then from midnight to two, and that was when I started also to go a lot to Frágil. Aaron Gonsher What did pirate radio mean in Portugal at that time? Because pirate radio is this loose term for illegal radio but I assume that there are more nuances to that. Rui Vargas For small periods of time, and I don’t recall why, the frequencies were open, so everybody could broadcast without the police coming and take your material. There were like an explosion of little radios everywhere in the neighborhood and all across the country, until I believe in ’90, there was a contest to choose for radios in Lisbon and for radios in Porto, to limit the... But going to your question, it meant freedom. It meant freedom without any commercial concerns. You could play whatever you want to and be obnoxious sometimes and do some crazy programs that made no sense nowadays maybe. Aaron Gonsher Was it difficult at all for you to get your hand on the music that you wanted to play at that point? If we’re talking ’88, ’89... Rui Vargas Absolutely. Aaron Gonsher This is when house was sort of blowing up internationally. Rui Vargas But even before that it was very difficult to get to the records, because that’s why radio made such an important role by then. The record labels in Portugal worked very poorly. They released few records, with bad pressings most of the time, and most of the good music wasn’t released in Portugal. When it was released, it was like months later. It was pre-Internet. We didn’t have internet then, so every time a family or a friend traveled to London or to Paris we would ask, “Can you bring me, can you go to HMV and bring me some records?” There were two record shops importing, or two or three record shops importing by then records, but they were very expensive for young teenagers like myself. Aaron Gonsher And you weren’t getting records for free just because you were at the radio, because it was a pirate station at that point. Rui Vargas Yeah, by then there wasn’t that chance. Only like that when I got professionalized. But in the ’80s there was a very important, I would say two record shops for the scene. One directly linked to the Bairro Alto scene and the underground and more alternative scene which was called Controverse, which was like a pole of, again, a magnet for music lovers. The guy who run the shop, he was a very, very astute guy. He would import from industrial Belgium or EBM to Alexander O’Neal soul, e-pop, techno, house. But very impeccable chosen. I would spend – everybody would spend – afternoons there, talking with each other and exchanging notes and information. Because information was scarce by then. We had newspapers, Melody Maker, New Musical Express, Billboard, and a few other, not so many other magazines or newspapers imported, again. The major way to pass around information was speaking with your mates, with your friends and with your music-lover friends. Aaron Gonsher At this point, you had no aspirations to actually make music. You were solely focused on, “I wanna buy records, I wanna play records for people.” Rui Vargas Absolutely. I think I never had that trigger, “I can do this or I think I’m prepared to do music.” I never felt I was prepared. I always thought of it as, it’s okay. I don’t feel pressure to be a producer or to make music like nowadays. In my generation there are a lot of guys that, it’s normal. My profession is to pick the best records I can find and play them. It’s not to pretend I’m a good producer or to pretend I make good music, because 90% of people that think like that, they are wrong. From one side it’s great. Everybody is willing to have a go and do it yourself. It’s the punk motto, and it’s a motto that I defend every time. At the same time it’s hard to find a good record nowadays, a record that really is striking, new, fresh. You listen to a lot of the same beats, the same samples over and over until you find a good record. Maybe that’s why there’s so much going on now at the moment with old records and going back to digging and finding jams that weren’t discovered before. The production, there are amazing people doing music still, of course. I think I never did music because of respect of the musicians. I wasn’t feeling prepared to compete and to be up there with them. Aaron Gonsher Let’s play another song that, even if it’s not a new one, I think at a certain point in time it probably represented something shockingly new. Rui Vargas Absolutely. (music: Jungle Wonz – “The Jungle”) This was maybe the first house record I’ve heard. Aaron Gonsher What record was that? Rui Vargas This is Marshall Jefferson, and the project he has like Jungle Wonz, and the song is called “The Jungle.” It was ’88 maybe when I’ve heard this for the first time, and it was from a tape from a radio show by Jazzie B. He was then one of the first DJs in the KISS FM in London, and he was also the mentor from Soul II Soul, a band quite popular then. In the middle of funk, soul, and more low-beat songs he played in the show, he played this track. I went also bananas with it, and I just wanted to know what it was and have this record and hear it loud on the dancefloor. I think maybe it’s one of the first records that wanted me to go to a dancefloor with my eyes closed. It’s kind of a trademark of the sound I like and I still play. Aaron Gonsher What do you mean by that? Rui Vargas Organic, electronic, at the same time. Deep, melodic, mysterious, moody. It’s my cup of tea. My kind of thing, I guess. From then on I started. I went to another record shop, which was called B-Motor, specially focused on dance music, that record shop – also quite important for the scene then. I started buying records, every Trax record, every Chicago record that I could find. Aaron Gonsher How did the Lisbon crowd respond when you were playing these records? Because the story of house jumping to the UK is that a song like “Strings of Life” cleared the floor one week and then a month later, that’s only when it became a hit. But people were too confused by it at first. It was so against what they wanted out of the music at that point. Rui Vargas I remember clearing the floor also with some of my first house choices. But like I said, they were mixed with other, more familiar kind of sounds. So it was like a moment, like, “OK, let’s do this, let’s clear the floor.” We would play it, and of course but it wasn’t that hard, amazingly. I think people got it, not instantly, but it was quite a quick reaction, and soon after there were nights more focused on house in bigger clubs in Lisbon like Kremlin or Alcantara-Mar, but with a harder sound, with a harder and faster sound, more European than American. Aaron Gonsher More European, but still not Portuguese? Rui Vargas That came a little bit later. Of course, everybody in the room knows the phenomenon that was “So Get Up” by the Underground Sound of Lisbon. Thanks mainly to of course to those two guys, but also to António Cunha, which was the label owner or the label master. And he always tried to push our music, the Portuguese music to other territories across our physical frontiers. Because of the phenomenal world success of USL, a lot of producers emerged, and they were also embraced not only by Kaos, this label, but also by a very important guy in the history of that Portuguese scene which is an American guy called Rob Di Stefano, who ran Tribal America in the ’90s, which was one of the best and most important house music labels in the ’90s. With Deep Dish, Danny Tenaglia, Club 69, a lot of fresh new producers that started in that label. Like I said, after the undergrounds under Lisbon, Urban Dreams, Orzone, Cult of Crimeria, Louis Light, they all get their, they all rode the wave, the Portuguese wave, and people outside of Portugal paid attention. Aaron Gonsher We’re talking about the mid-’90s at this point? Rui Vargas The mid-’90s, yeah. Aaron Gonsher When did that wave crash, and what happened in Lisbon after that? There was so much international attention on the scene at this certain point, and it didn’t sustain, at least not the same musically. Rui Vargas It is weird, actually. I don’t have an explanation for that, but it faded away. It slowly faded away. When we thought, OK, we have the international media attention... They were calling Portugal the new Ibiza or the “Paradise Called Portugal,” underground house music from “Paradise Called Portugal.” Big raves started to happen in castles and in huge warehouses with thousands of people. We created the momentum, the big momentum. Everything was growing and everybody was having a party, really, and things started to fade away because there were divisions in the scene. There were parties that were a rip-off. There were problems eventually. I think the production didn’t cope also with the momentum that created. Somehow only Underground Sound of Lisbon and a few others continued a few more years to produce records and hit records, but things started to fade away a few years after. Aaron Gonsher But then at the end of the ’90s, a club opened? Rui Vargas Yeah. Aaron Gonsher That went on to define the next two decades of your life. Rui Vargas At least for me, of course. Aaron Gonsher Probably people in this room know what I’m talking about. But for the sake of the lecture, what am I referring to and how did this come about, and more importantly, who was behind it? Rui Vargas OK, the same team, obviously Manuel Reis, the owner of Frágil and the people around him, we were thinking that Frágil was already, not only Frágil but the whole neighborhood was fading, and Frágil was limited for what we wanted to do. So we started to look for options and places to move to, and to expand our horizons and to change again another part of the city. And that was Manuel’s fault again. He dramatically changed the life in Bairro Alto, which was before a neighborhood with hookers, journalists in cellars. Journalists, because there were actually newspapers working in the neighborhood, not because the journalists were chasing the hookers. But yeah, it was like that. It was a shady neighborhood. Nobody would go there until they opened a restaurant, and two years later Frágil opened in ’82 and the whole scene started to emerge. The same will was put in action in another area of Lisbon that was forgotten, middle of the, halfway from the center to the new Lisbon that was inaugurated that year at the Expo, Expo ’98. So it was a no man’s land. And we took over a warehouse that were... I went there in ‘97 for the first time and they were repairing engines for ships, and it was like a building to support machinery from boats and stuff, crumbling apart the building almost. And it was our dream that came through. Aaron Gonsher How much of a role did Manuel [Reis] have it shaping the musical vision of Lux? Rui Vargas Yeah, I think the best answer to that is he trusted people. And he gave chance to people. Because musically, he never hardly gave opinions about music. But he trusted the people he was working with. And it was always like that. But apart from the music, he took care of everything, from the aesthetics, the people, the collaborators, the artists he invited to do chair, or a new decoration for the Lux, the colors of the stairs, the colors of everything. He spend the whole day there. Every morning around 11, he would be there and he would leave at eight o’clock, for 19 years. He would be there at night. He was completely obsessed, in a good way, with Lux. Aaron Gonsher And are there other lessons that you’ve taken from that relationship, other than the obsession? Rui Vargas Of course, the generosity of opening the doors, his doors, to other people to show their work. He was always a person who wanted to give space and the stage for all sorts of musical artists, visual artists in Lisbon and across Portugal, I believe. And of course, music-wise, people from abroad, also. But he wanted more than everything to... He saw Lux not as a club, not as a nightclub, a place where people go to dance and have a few drinks, but as a work of art overall, from the door, from the behavior of the people who are working. We are very, very, very tight with each other. We are restless. We are never happy with what we got. We want to be and to make things always new, in a new way and in a better way. And that was what he taught us. Aaron Gonsher How important do you think that sense of community is to the fact that Lux has existed for 20 years? That there is a group of people who are willing to put in all of their energy into something that they truly believe in, separate from treating it just as a commercial concern? Rui Vargas I think you answered the question. The core of Lux, they work together at least 20 years, because some of them, they come from Frágil. And for instance, the team of residents, there isn’t one that left Lux since the beginning and we started with seven residents – the whole seven are there. There are like two or three more. But no one left. And every time someone left was heartbroken. It was very, very rare to see in 20 years someone leaving with a smile or with a grin. Aaron Gonsher And how do you think your own artistry as a DJ has evolved over those 20 years, in response to the people that you have around you? First of all, all these other residents, but also all the shifts that have occurred musically, or in the city even? Rui Vargas Being a resident in Lux and throughout... I play in Lux for 20 years, like I said. I play every week. For 18 years, I played every week except for weeks of holidays. So that makes a thousand times I played in Lux, maybe. So it’s difficult to talk about Rui Vargas as a DJ and not talk about Lux, because I grew up there. That’s where I learned my work and my thing. But it’s a constant challenge to play week after week after week, because your audience keeps on revolving, keeps on changing. And even with the same audience, moods are different from one day to other. It’s a constant challenge and non-ending challenge. And I go, I swear, I go every single night that I have a whole night set, in Lux, playing six hours and I go there like the first time because it’s my favorite night of the month, every time I have six hours in a club. Six or seven. And doing painting with my records, or trying to. Aaron Gonsher Is that your preferred metaphor of choice these days? Painting with records? Or is there some other way that you would describe what you’re trying to do over those six hours? Rui Vargas I have a few more metaphors, but painting is one of them. But communicating is another one. Expressing my... Maybe it’s even when I was young, maybe it was easier for me to express my feelings to a girl through a mixtape than through a letter. Aaron Gonsher Classic. Rui Vargas Or talking directly. I always express myself through music, through other peoples’ music. I learned to do that. So that’s one way of seeing things. I’m trying to express myself through other people’s music. But I’m creating like a big canvas where colors are substitute by records. Instead of colors, I use records and I paint a huge mosaic every night I have in Lux for six hours, and I try to make a nice overall object, instead of a messy one. Sometimes it happens it could be like messy, because it’s a live performance. It’s not something I work at it at home or prepare things. 90% of what I do, it’s from improvisation, so sometimes I mess up, sometimes it’s beautiful. It is like this. Aaron Gonsher I wanna play another song that you had actually chosen. It’s representative of your time at Lux in some way. Rui Vargas OK, sure. (music: Moodymann – “I Can’t Kick This Feeling When It Hits”) The simplicity of this record blew me away every time I hear it. And the power and the hugeness, the dimension of this record, only made with two or three samples. Aaron Gonsher That was Moodymann, “I Can’t Kick This Feeling When It Hits.” And I think a record like that, I agree with you about the simplicity. And it’s also timeless in a way. It’s transcending all these periods. And I was curious, what makes a record timeless to you? As someone who has heard so many, mixed with so many over the course of your career, what makes a record timeless, in your ears? Rui Vargas That’s a tough one. First, it has to be honest. You can’t do a timeless record with tricks, gimmicks or the new thing. It has to be honest, it has to be true. That’s a tough one. Basically, it has to touch people’s hearts somehow. And I think that’s a tricky one. Only a few people can rate themselves of doing that. I don’t know. That was a tough question. But honestly, it’s the bottom line for me. As a DJ as well, I don’t really care of people playing too neat, too perfect, too one sort of sound, one sort of music. And you go back to your house and you don’t remember one record, one trick, one song, one line. What I do care is to close my eyes, get into a club and know for sure that this can only be this guy. Even if he’s messing up, taking risks. But honestly, above all, don’t play a record you don’t like. Never. Aaron Gonsher And as long as you’re not playing records you don’t like, you’re gonna continue doing this for another 30 years, do you think? Rui Vargas Just as long as people have air. Aaron Gonsher I’m sure they will be. Thank you for joining us today. [applause] Rui Vargas Thank you. Aaron Gonsher We’re gonna open it up to questions. There’s some microphones on either side. So if you just raise your hand, people will be able to run right over quickly and give you a microphone. Someone right in the middle. It’ll take a while to pass down. Audience Member Hi, thank you very much. That was a really touching story that you told us. Rui Vargas [responds in Portuguese] Audience Member Yeah. So with all the knowledge and experience that you have, that you’ve been through your life, everything that you did, when you see this young generations approaching, creative minds approaching new issues, trying to break through, trying to create something new, do you have any piece of advice to those young generations which are trying to do their things as well? What tips would you give those young people today? Rui Vargas It’s a bit vague, but you have to believe in yourself and you have to believe that you can do different. And one thing that struck me, again going to the beginning of the conversation, about this radio show that I was listening to every night, the slogan was “O direito de diference,” which means “The right to do different. The right to be different.” First, I engraved that, because be different was cool, certainly, after 50 long years of censorship. And always trying to be different, I think, was also Manuel’s motto, in Lux, that he passed to us. Always try to be creative, be different, do things our own way. And sometimes dismantling the rules, the norm, and twisting it and believing in yourself. That’s what I would say. Audience Member Is it something that you still try to apply to yourself as well? Rui Vargas Every day. And I try to believe in myself. Sometimes it’s not easy because, of course, playing in a club every week for 20 years, sometimes you don’t really feel empathetic with the music, with the trends, with the music that is trendy in that period. Sometimes you struggle, sometimes you shake. But if you believe you have what it gets – or what it takes, sorry – if you believe you have what it takes, you go through the storm and there’s calmer seas after.

Valgeir Sigurðsson
Valgeir Sigurðsson is an Icelandic musician who blends the familiar and esoteric, exposing the new within the known. Over the last two decades, Sigurðsson has cultivated projects by diverse international artists via the Bedroom Community label, which he co-founded with Ben Frost and Nico Muhly, and lent his expertise to the likes of Brian Eno, Sigur Rós and Feist as the founder of the Greenhouse Studios, one of Iceland’s top recording facilities. His career flourished in 1998 when Björk requested him as engineer and programmer for Lars von Trier’s Academy Award-nominated Dancer in the Dark soundtrack, a monumental project that combined his passion for electronic, orchestral and film music. Over the past decade Sigurðsson has released four solo albums of modern, experimental classical, further cementing his role both in the tight-knit Icelandic community and abroad.
In this public conversation as part of Sónar Reykjavík, Sigurðsson discussed his career, from founding Greenhouse Studios to recording his latest album, Dissonance, and detailed his particular approach to composition.
Hosted by Aaron Gonsher Thank you for joining us today, everyone. If you’re in the room right now, then I’m sure you know who the person who is joining us today is. But just in case you do not, he is a composer, a producer, an engineer, who has spent the last 20 years releasing and making music that consistently challenges perceptions and genre boundaries. His home base is here in Iceland, at the Greenhouse Studios. Please join me in welcoming Valgeir Sigurðsson. We have a lot of music to discuss, because you’ve had a very extensive career. But before we start to talk about some of the music that you’ve made, I’d like to play something that I understand was particularly transformative for you as a listener, in setting you on your musical path today. And it might be a little bit unexpected for people, but let’s take a listen to this song. (music: Prince – “When Doves Cry” / applause) So, that was obviously Prince, “When Doves Cry.” Can you take me back to the first time that you heard that song, and maybe explain why it was so transformative for you? valgeir sigurðsson I think I heard it first in the film Purple Rain. And that was sort of my introduction to Prince, when I was maybe 13. And that was a time in my life where I had been studying electric guitar and playing electric guitar and playing, like, rock and punk music. And starting to get more interested in electronics and electronic music and music production. And I remember seeing that film, and seeing the musicians use drum machines onstage, and guitars, and everything in combination. And I remember there was a sequence in the film where Prince is writing a piece of music and just, in an angry moment or something, turns on a drum machine and just plays along. And I was like, “Shit, you don’t need a drummer.” So I think that was one of the things that... I mean, I’ve watched that film maybe a million times, and every little detail about it I was kind of obsessed with at that time in my life. And I picked this song, I think, as one, I could have picked any from that record. Because, you know, I lived it, basically. And it was different to a lot of the music that I had been listening to, I guess, up till that point. Aaron Gonsher What had your musical references been, separately? As a guitarist and just as a listener as well. valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, well, that was also a... Before that, it was more straight rock, with the guitars. The Clash and Sex Pistols were a big favorite of mine. And that was kind of the music that I had been trying to play, as a nine and ten year old. And then opening my ears to bands like Japan and Talk Talk, who were using more synths, and the New Romantic electronic music of the ’80s coming in. Aaron Gonsher At the time that you were studying music, and playing guitar, did it mean anything to you that Prince was not only the guitarist but the composer and the mixer and the engineer, was basically this one-man band? What did that mean to you as something that potentially gave you the idea of what you could aspire to in multiple roles in music? As opposed to being limited to just one? valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, that actually was a big part of why I think I was attracted to this film and this way of music-making, with people and with machines. And growing up where I did grow up, in the north of Iceland, with about a thousand people living there, I didn’t have musicians to play with a lot of the time. The technology was very new at the time and not so accessible as it is today, obviously. I wanted to play the guitar as an instrument, but I knew that I wouldn’t necessarily want to be a guitar player. But I wanted to make music. So at the time, I was starting to understand that producing music in the studio would be a way to do things that wouldn’t limit one to be in a band, and just being in that role of the guitarist, or a specific corner, you know. And being able to write and produce in your bedroom almost, you know, that was a very attractive idea for me. Aaron Gonsher Do you remember what your earliest set-up might have been? When you actually started to produce music on your own, before you actually went to study. valgeir sigurðsson Yeah. I started buying a Roland drum machine, I remember. It was a 707. And then I got another Roland keyboard. It was a JX-03 that I actually still have today. I don’t have the 707. But those machines were with the guitar I was using. Actually before that, I had a neighbor who had a home organ with preset drums. And I took a tape machine over and recorded the drums from the rock, bossa nova, samba, jazz. At three different tempos. So I could play along to them. So that was before I was able to buy a drum machine. A way to kind of have that at hand. So I was kind of playing around the tape and recording. Aaron Gonsher At what point did you take this informal education and interest into a more formal realm, and start to study engineering? Was it in London? valgeir sigurðsson Yeah. When I moved to Reykjavík when I was about 15, and then I started studying classical guitar as well, around the same time. And my interest had also kind of opened for classical music. Also, having a sister who was playing the piano and playing classical pieces, I was intrigued by that music. That was my first exposure to classical music. And then the engineering, I saw an ad in the paper one day. And it said, “Free studio time. Come and record your demo.” So I went. And I had been writing songs in my room, and went to this small basement studio that belonged to a guy who was formerly in a band and had now sort of lost interest in the studio a bit. But he was getting clients in, so you’d only have to pay him for his time. And so I did that and came out with four demos or something like that. And then he actually started asking me... He kind of picked up on my curiosity about the studio environment. I had come to Reykjavik to study, to go on to, like, a grammar school. But I wasn’t really interested in that. So actually, I was more interested in the studio. And he picked up on this and he said, “You could come and help me out if you want.” And so I started coming to his studio. And suddenly I found myself in a place with equipment, with microphones, with a 12-track tape recorder, a mixing desk, some outboard equipment. And I could help him out, and spend the evenings making my music. And eventually, six months later or so, it had become a job. And I actually quit school to do that job. Aaron Gonsher And this was still in Reykjavik? valgeir sigurðsson This is still in Reykjavik. This is like, oh let’s see, this is ’87. Aaron Gonsher Is the guy still around? valgeir sigurðsson I think he is, but he’s not in the studio. This was his, like, getting out of the studio business, was selling me the equipment. When I was 17. And living there, basically, with the recording studio. To run and to have as my... I actually was living next door to it, so it was kind of the beginning. I’m still running Greenhouse. So this is 30 years ago. Then two years later, I actually decided that I would need to go and study a bit more formally, and live somewhere else. So I applied to go to the SAE in London, where I studied music production and engineering. Aaron Gonsher Separate from the actual education component of your time in London, were there any specific musical experiences that you had there in the city that you might not have had access to had you stayed in Reykjavik? In terms of things that further expand musical reference points, or something like that. valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, I think it’s just also a part of growing up and not just as a musical experience. Just seeing a different community, being away and learning to live on your own, and all that. It’s an important part of the education. Like learning about life, you know. I wanted to stay in London longer and try to get a job there, but that didn’t work out. So I ended up coming back. And I had sold the equipment, so it was kind of a transition for me. I had been able to kind of support myself with the studio work. Doing, like, editing radio commercials and doing band demos and this and that. And writing my own music, kind of, in my spare time. Playing with friends. But I think it’s... It was a really important time for me, to go away and come back. Just how you kind of see the place that you’re from in a different perspective when you return. And when you’re away, you know. You appreciate the things, maybe, that you forget about when you’re in the middle of it. Aaron Gonsher So would you say that the lessons from this time spent studying music were not actually as important for you? In terms of what they were teaching you about the gear, or the electronics, or the process. It was more about creating this mindset, of you having this sort of musical life? valgeir sigurðsson Yeah. I agree with that. I think that I was slightly underwhelmed with the course because the amount of practical studio time was quite limited. And it was in the day where access to a... There were a few computers in the school, but there was one main control room, and you kind of had to book it out months in advance. And then you had to find people to bring into the studio. So there wasn’t really... I mean, kind of in retrospect, you learn survival, so you just have to make the best of it that you can. But I think the overall experience was very positive and useful. Nothing was kind of handed to you. You had to figure it out. Aaron Gonsher And then you came back to Iceland, you were playing in bands. At what point did you decide to create Greenhouse, where you’re still working today? Because it sounds like it was partially in reaction to these experiences that you had, but also building upon the positive. valgeir sigurðsson Yes, I think that it stayed with me, having access to the equipment. And I had kept some of the equipment, mostly the instruments and the things that I could carry with me. You know, going into studios for every project was not something that I liked. I missed having the access to, and being able to invite people to come and use the space and collaborate. So I started getting, like collecting more gear, a bit more deliberately, and having a little set-up that enabled me to eventually get a space and get a bit more serious about it. Because this is, again... I don’t know if everybody remembers the time before computers. We’re so used to it now. But it was much more of a thing, you know, to get a dedicated tape recorder. Not a machine that does everything, your email and everything else and you make music on it as well. I was kind of slow to get into computers, because they always felt very counterproductive to me. Like, they didn’t move as fast as I wanted them to move. They didn’t have any memory. You think so much faster than they react to. Whereas now they’re starting to become good tools. So collecting the gear and setting up a space was something that I wanted to do again. Aaron Gonsher When the first people were coming out to Greenhouse, I guess at that time you were mainly producing other people’s work. valgeir sigurðsson Mm-hmm. Aaron Gonsher Do you remember what the reaction was to the space? Being the type of studio that it is, in the location that it is. valgeir sigurðsson Yeah. It wasn’t in the location it was in, the space, from the beginning. I started in a slightly more humble setting. The equipment was very, like, collected from here and there, in a makeshift sort of space, in an industrial park. And the name Greenhouse actually comes from that sort of idea of having a greenhouse of ideas in this kind of concrete landscape. Whereas the Greenhouse, where it is today and has been for the last 18 years, is in a very green area. But the reaction, people were just happy to come to a space where they could make noise and record and have a good quality outcome. And it was sort of more about those connections than necessarily about the gear, or about the space. Aaron Gonsher Greenhouse was founded in 1997. In the first location. And then, in 2006 was the first record that came out on Bedroom Community. What was happening in your musical life during that ten-year span, basically, that led you to the moment of deciding to found the label? Separate from any sort of, you know, meeting Nico [Muhly] or Ben [Frost]. I’m curious about the musical progression during that time that made it seem sensible. valgeir sigurðsson Well, before starting Greenhouse in the beginning, I had been playing with a few different bands and different local acts that toured a bit and had records out. So kind of learning about it from that side as well, being as only a keyboard player in a band and touring. And then being the one who would kind of produce the recording if I can, or engineer it. And then those collaborations kind of led to the studio coming together as a space. And then, in the beginning I was working quite a lot with the Bad Taste label, Smekkleysa, who would always ask me, occasionally, to do a project. It was a group of people who had kind of similar interests in music-making, I guess. What was the question? [laughs] Aaron Gonsher Why was it suddenly a good idea to have the label, in 2006, if it didn’t seem like such a good idea in 2003, or 2000, or in 1987 when you first started? valgeir sigurðsson Right. Well, I didn’t start thinking about the label until... Well, I guess I started thinking about it in the early 2000s. I had sometimes come across projects that I wanted to be involved with that didn’t have a label. So in the end, it was like, “Well, we can’t really put all this effort into it if nobody’s going to hear it. It seems a little bit wrong to do that.” My instinct is usually to just figure things out and to do them, rather than try to find, for example, the right label for each project. I thought when I wanted to get my own music released, I should just release it myself. So that’s where I started seriously thinking about having a label, because I had the studio. I had the infrastructure to make the records and the ideas to make the music. But, I don’t know, it’s kind of where I come from, like this do-it-yourself way of thinking. Aaron Gonsher I actually want to play an excerpt of something from the very first release on Bedroom Community. It’s 12 minutes long, so we’re not going to listen to the entire thing, but this is an excerpt of Nico Muhly’s “Keep in Touch.” This is on Speaks Volumes, which it was the first release, yes? (music: Nico Muhly — “Keep in Touch”) That was the last five minutes of “Keep in Touch.” If you haven’t heard it, go listen to the full album. You produced that for Nico. valgeir sigurðsson Mm-hmm. Aaron Gonsher And I guess there’s sort of a funny story I’ve read of Nico describing you wanting to produce that record based off of how terrible it sounded when he first sent it to you. valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, no, he sent me... When we were starting to get to know each other, he was this assistant to Philip Glass in the Looking Glass studio, which is his former headquarters in New York, and I was working there as well. He was sort of sneaking around and we started talking, and I asked him to send me some of his music because he talked about it. He sent me these recordings, apologizing for them being recorded just with one microphone somewhere in the ceiling in a performance. I was like, “Yeah. This is great music, but we can’t have it sounding like this. It deserves better than this.” He was immediately into the idea that we would just do it and make a good version of these pieces. Aaron Gonsher Separate from just improving that particular release, when you were listening to other modern classical music, did you have an idea in your head of how you wanted to change the way it was produced and presented? valgeir sigurðsson I don’t know if I listened to music or look at things always with the idea of how I wanted to chang them, but I did have an idea of how I might want to do it. Not necessarily like I want to do new music, but with this particular record, I thought, recording these classical instruments in a way that we kind of approached them in pop or rock music would not be a sin to try it. Aaron Gonsher Can you break down what that means for people who might not know the difference between the typical recording? valgeir sigurðsson Exactly. So what is the traditional way of recording tends to be like you have big group of people playing, but maybe three or six microphones or something. You’re trying to capture the room as if it were a live performance, so you try to optimize the space that you’re playing in. You do it really quickly and you try to edit together a few good takes, and that’s it. The other way to do it is to go into the studio and map out the piece, layer it instrument by instrument sometimes, and take a lot of care with how you place the mics and how you treat each recording. In my case, at this time, I had been getting very much interested in getting a lot closer to the source of the sound than traditionally you would get a room recording. So I was exploring a lot of very extreme close mic-ing; rather than recording things on a stereo, overhead pair, would record them with one mic like this close and another one up there. Then I would balance it to sound like something that I was hearing, and to get maybe some nuances that I was missing. In this piece that we heard, “Keep In Touch,” it was actually recorded, a lot of the percussion elements are from the viola, some sampled sounds of her doing stuff to the viola you’re not supposed to do. So that’s Nadia Sirota, and that’s the first time we recorded together. I found that how... I wasn’t used to maybe classical, people coming from the classical world, being that excited and open to that experimentation process. They’re always trained to conceal the imperfections of their instruments, and you play into a beautiful-sounding space hoping that nobody will hear the scratchy sounds of the strings, whereas there we would go and amplify those sounds. Aaron Gonsher Even though they’re all sonically different, I think there’s a really strong connection between those first three releases on Bedroom Community, which was the one we just listened to, Speaks Volumes, Ben Frost and then your own, Ekvílíbrium. But they are definitely not in the same genre of music. So what do you think is the uniting factor for this music, if there would be something separate from genre? Because I think they’re really... Yhey are sort of too connected to feel like they’re completely disparate. valgeir sigurðsson I think there’s some kind of an aesthetic that we shared at the time and still probably do that filtered through. And the fact that they’re recorded and mixed in the same space, we’re all kind of involved in them in some way, even though in very different capacities of course. I felt that there was a strong connection between the way the three of us approached our music-making, and I felt that it worked perfectly together as the first three releases on the same label. I think that’s as far as I can go in explaining what it is. It was just a feeling. Aaron Gonsher How much of the way that you approach music-making has changed from your first solo release to now? valgeir sigurðsson I think it has changed a lot probably. Yeah. Aaron Gonsher I’m curious, are you writing on the same instruments as you were then? Is your notation process completely different? valgeir sigurðsson It’s funny that actually I feel like almost everything before Bedroom Community was an exercise. I feel like it was education almost, like maybe setting up Bedroom Community, starting that, my own... It was like my graduation, like my thesis or something. My big project and now life happens, now you’re on your own and now it’s the real life, the real world. I think that it’s changed in ways that maybe I think I approach projects in maybe a slightly more relaxed way and I’ve matured, I hope, both as a composer and as someone who guides other people through their process. I definitely spend less time in the studio than I used to. I think about music probably more than I used to. I don’t know if that makes sense. There’s always something going on, but I’m physically less there. Because I think I know, I go quicker through it maybe. Not to say that I always know what I’m going for, or there’s not experimentation anymore. Not at all. I think that still a big part of my process is sitting and trying, editing. I work a lot with reduction... I pile a lot of stuff in and then I spend a lot of time sifting through it and just taking it apart and putting it back together and throwing out stuff and cleaning it up. The rest of the composition happens pretty fluidly and rapidly. Yeah, that’s probably just development. I don’t know if I can put my finger on a shift from that. It’s just a gradual. Aaron Gonsher You’ve also had to write music that was commissioned by other people. I guess your second and your third albums were both created with a different work in mind initially. What sort of challenges does that present to have to fit your music to some other entity entirely? I guess it was a ballet for the third, and a film for the second, or vice-versa? valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you’re right. Yeah. They’re different projects, and there are different challenges actually in each case. For me, the positive is having almost someone else waiting for the music to happen and it being contextualized in some way and there being a concept to the music. Architecture Of Loss, this dance piece by Stephen Petronio and his dance company, all I had for that was the title. He gave me the title, and then I could run with it. We discussed basically what that title meant to me, what it meant to him, what he thought about when he thought about those words put together. Aaron Gonsher So he was going to create a dance piece that was however long your music was, just based off of that title? Or was there more restrictions in place? valgeir sigurðsson No, the length was actually, was supposed to be about maximum 40 minutes. That’s just the program that he had to work with. I could write music in that [timeframe]. The other restriction in that project was that we... That was new for me because I had to construct it for a live performance, because we performed the music with the dance in the beginning, in the first run. And we could only have three people, whereas before I had been working with unlimited [time] and always thinking [about] the live performance afterwards. So it was one of the first, at least, big pieces that I wrote for a specific number of people in mind and then had to work within that frame. Whereas Dreamland was a film that had big themes and big subjects, and we wanted the music to be quite expansive and orchestral in parts, and never really thinking about the live, if that music would be played live. Which it has been since quite a lot, and with orchestras of sizes from like 26 to 60. Those versions were created afterwards, but the project was built in this studio approach where I get small sections in and layered them together. Aaron Gonsher The sense of adaptability seems so important, in general... The ability to take this restriction and create something from it or have something very small and then build it out further and further. I think that threads through a lot of your work. valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, it does. This is one of the things that Nico and I, especially in the beginning when we were doing Speaks Volumes... His background being in the performance, ready for performance, and mine ready for studio, and then combining that, we then started making different versions of the pieces to perform with whoever was around. If Nadia was around to play the viola, then we would play certain pieces and then I would electronics. The electronics would maybe include half of the pre-recorded tracks, and I would figure out a way to make those electronics feel alive and interactive for me to not just stand there pressing a button. I think that reverse engineering, the recording and the writing, and crossing it in all ways possible was and is an important thing for my work. Aaron Gonsher I want to play something from Dreamland, the title track. I think I might butcher the title if I try to pronounce the Icelandic, Draumalandið. I guess that’s okay? valgeir sigurðsson That was pretty bad. No, that was pretty good, sorry. [laughs] Aaron Gonsher I warned you, but this is “Dreamland.” (music: Valgeir Sigurðsson – “Draumalandið”) So that was “Dreamland.” I think there’s an interesting environmental aspect to you making this score specifically that I sort of want to unpack because the film itself is about Alcoa, the former Aluminum Company of America, and their plants for aluminum or iron on the Icelandic coast? valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, the damming project that was in the east. Well, that’s kind of... Yeah, one of the, part of this film is about that. It’s based on a book that is about general exploitation of resources and of nature and corporations taking advantage of small communities, and how much do we value the land that we have, versus a short-term profit that we could make from one of these projects. Aaron Gonsher How do you translate something like that into music? Because it’s not just about writing to the film at that point. It’s very complex topics that you have to reflect musically in some way. valgeir sigurðsson I mean, you heard this dramatic piece of music there. The fun thing about working on that film was, it’s a lot of talking heads. A lot of people on both sides of the argument, for and against these projects and these dams. In between, you’re given time to consider a little bit what’s going on, what have these people been saying, and we see a lot of landscape, we see a lot of nature. Often, in these moments, the music was playing with those scenes. The sadness in it is that a lot of it is landscape and nature that has been drowned for creating these big dams. I don’t know, I didn’t find it difficult at all to make music that illustrated that, that sadness, that tragedy in a way. I think it wasn’t a hard thing. It’s harder for me to write a happy piece of music than it is to write a sad piece of music. Aaron Gonsher Is that subject... When you think about Bedroom Community as being a label that is first of all based in Iceland on an island, and then has to create presumably a large amount of vinyl, which is a petroleum product. I’m curious if you’ve thought about that in relation to the label, after you had to have that experience thinking about it? In relation to the country overall. valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, obviously I think of it all the time. Lose sleep over it. It is what it is, I guess. We’re in kind of a weird time in history with all these sort of products. And music is moving into the digital world, which has no... Well, it probably does have a carbon footprint, in some ways that you have power-hungry hard drives everywhere, and so on. But this thing about manufacturing plastic and products made from fossil fuels is not something that we necessarily... I mean, if there was another way, I don’t think we’re gonna stop producing them while people still want them. And I love buying them, and I don’t think that vinyl is responsible for destroying the planet on its own. Aaron Gonsher I don’t think it is either, but I think it’s interesting to think about the context of that other film. valgeir sigurðsson It is, and I think that what kind of bothers me even more is all the shipping and freight and then the fact that we have to bring all this... We don’t manufacture it here, so we have to have stocks all over the world from different places. And the quantities are so low at this point of time, that you don’t have a plant in every territory to manufacture, and then you kind of help to get these copies out into the world, and the price doesn’t reflect the manufacturing cost and the shipping cost and so on. So it’s all kind of in a weird place right now. Aaron Gonsher I think your latest release also reflects being aware of these sorts of contradictions. It’s the album Dissonance, which actually last night, if you haven’t heard, won the Icelandic Music Award for Best Album. Dissonance was your first album in five years; it came out last year. What was happening during that period that made you want to move away from focusing on producing other people’s work so heavily, and pursue more of your solo compositions and really focus on that? Was there one thing in particular, or was it an accumulation of different experiences that you can talk about? valgeir sigurðsson It’s an accumulation for sure. But in that time it’s not like Dissonance came out five years after, and I didn’t make any music, write any music in the meantime. All that music took a long time to write. I think the earliest piece is probably an orchestral commission from 2011, 2012 maybe. I was writing much more music then, and kind of to the point where I didn’t even have the time to kind of put it into an album format or release it, or sort of put it in a context like that. So actually, that’s a development that is both conscious, and I think a natural progression. And then I had, two-and-a-half years ago I had twins. So life kind of changes in the way that you appreciate the time that you have. And I’ve always wanted to... Actually, I forgot to tell you earlier that after I left, when I was leaving London, I actually applied to go to composition school. So I never got formal composition education. I learned how to read and write music playing guitar. Aaron Gonsher I think it ended up okay. valgeir sigurðsson Yeah I mean, I’m still making music, more music than ever before, so that’s fine. I just figured out my own way to do it. But so this was always the intention; it was always the direction. But I tend to kind of just do things on my own speed, and the reason for focusing less, putting the focus more into my writing music, and producing more with the closest collaborators on Bedroom Community is also it’s this time... Time is precious. And I feel like I’ve kind of done that enough for the moment. Maybe I’ll get back into that role more heavily, I don’t know. I can’t see it at the moment. But it’s a very different energy, and you feel like you’re kind of organizing other people’s lives a lot of the time, and their thoughts and their emotions and their expectations. Bedroom Community operates in a slightly different way. The projects are usually always ongoing, and I kind of dip my toe into many during one week. I might touch, send updates and versions to the artist, I get feedback, and it sort of develops until the music is ready. It might be like a week of intense recording, and then it sits on my hard drive and I work on it here and there. And a little bit how I work on my music as well. I might have a project that I have to put all my energy into, and then it goes somewhere, and then in the meantime I’m kind of working on six other things. And that’s just very much how I... So I like having these open conversations going and collaborations all the time, with all these different people, and writing for commissions and doing work in the theater, or film. This seems like how I enjoy making music at the moment. Aaron Gonsher And Dissonance as well was another piece of music that came from a concept in your head, before the actual process of composition started. Can you talk about what that was for the title track? valgeir sigurðsson Yes, the piece “Dissonance” is based on 45 seconds of a Mozart string quartet. Aaron Gonsher How long is the string quartet total, the original? valgeir sigurðsson It’s under ten minutes, but this is the first of four movements. And it’s an interesting piece, because it’s so different to everything that he had written. If you listen to it, it sounds a lot more like Shostakovich, something much closer in time. That’s why it was called the name “Dissonance” quartet, because you were not really used to at that time, hearing those. But it moves very fast in the original, and when I heard it for the first time I love how these dissonant chords come together really quickly and then resolve into something more kind of consistent. And I wanted to kind of expand these moments. I wanted to live them, and sit in them for minutes at a time. So I just took the score and I stretched it to about, I think it plays at about 2 BPM something like that. So it’s 23 minutes, the piece now. No, 11 BPM was what we figured out that we recorded it at. It was lower than the computer could go, so we had to divide it. I think we did it at 22. It would only go down to 20 BPM. So that was basically the starting point for the piece. Just kind of exploding these bars and sustaining those moments, and kind of reconstructing the piece. With Liam Byrne, who is the viola da gamba player that I built the piece with. He plays all the strings on the piece, and we did layers and layers and layers of him playing for 25 minutes at a time. So it took many, many days to get all the layers in. And sometimes we discovered that we had to re-do a layer, because when it was sitting against something else, something new then or maybe a part of a layer we had to kind of re-do. And then my process after that, after the recording was to shape it again... The dynamics, which one of these 20 something layers, what was the most prominent one? What was the kind of chords, what was the lead? So on. And reprocess them, re-amping them into guitar amps and distorting. Aaron Gonsher Do you find yourself being more interested in that sort of sprawl nowadays, as opposed to concision? Or do you not think there’s really a distinction between them and it was just the case for this one? valgeir sigurðsson Well, I think these longform pieces, I’m more comfortable with them for sure. But, I don’t know. I think it goes both ways really. Aaron Gonsher What makes you more comfortable with them? valgeir sigurðsson I think it’s just that I think I have a better understanding. I can see kind of further and into the future when starting a piece that is that long. And actually playing it live. We played it a lot, just the two of us live. It actually kind of makes you understand the piece and rediscover it in a way. And the fun thing for me when I play it live is that I’m always reworking the dynamics of it, and it can go many ways. And I think it can sound... At least to me, it can sound quite different from one performance to the next. Aaron Gonsher Let’s listen to a few minutes of this. This is "Dissonance" from 2017. (music: Valgeir Sigurðsson — “Dissonance”) So that’s the first five minutes of the 22 minutes. You should go listen to it if you haven’t, and I think that beautiful piece of music is actually a good ending point. So thank you very much for coming out today. We’re gonna open it up to a Q&A if people have questions. There should be a microphone that’s floating around. Or if not, you can just feel free to shout out the question yourself if you so desire. [points to someone in audience] Do you mind waiting for the mic? Audience Member Hi, thank you. I was just wondering regarding structure, structures of song and the music you make, what is your kind of approach to structure? valgeir sigurðsson Yeah, structure is very important for me. But I don’t know that I have a clear answer, because I think I always rely on my instincts. And one of the challenges is with kind of longer pieces, is that I think the journey has to make sense, and it can be tricky to see if the structure is good or bad. Looking at it, you kind of have to be able to zoom out, and yeah, that’s my only answer. Audience Member Thanks. Aaron Gonsher Was there anyone else? Audience Member I actually have a question. Aaron Gonsher Go for it. Audience Member How important are reference tracks for you during mixing and mastering? valgeir sigurðsson I guess less and less. You can learn a lot from listening to... If you’re just thinking about the mastering process, or the mixing of the track, then of course it helps to have something that you know is tried and tested, and you listen to it in your car, and you listen to it in the club, and you listen to it on the radio, and you listen to it on your laptop speakers and, “This always sounds good.” So you can measure things up against it. But then I guess I hardly ever use them anymore. But I think I used to, just to convince myself that I couldn’t get this any further. “There can’t be any more bass than this. This can’t be louder, this can’t be…” Yeah, so but then actually I mean my reference tracks, they tend to be my stuff that I worked on. Because also I can kind of very easily, or more easily I can analyze it in my head, and I can remember what the process was. For example, I think By the Throat, Ben Frost’s album, I think we mastered that five times or something. And in my opinion, it’s a mastering that I think brought us much to the way the record sounds as the mixing. I mixed it as well, but the mastering actually kind of really pushed it forward, and that’s an album that I go back to sometimes. Aaron Gonsher If there’s not anyone else, then we’ll wrap up. But thank you again for joining us today, really appreciate it. valgeir sigurðsson Thanks for having me.

Serge
An active member of the dance music community for close to 30 years, Serge has remained largely behind the scenes and behind the decks, choosing to find, release and play music rather than produce it. Beginning as a DJ in the late ’80s, the Dutch native founded Clone Records in 1993, a Rotterdam shop and label known to champion techno in all its forms, from the galactic trips of Drexciya and the electronic punk of ADULT to the homegrown motifs of Alden Tyrell. Having cut his teeth at a time when DJs were expected to play all kinds of music, all night, Serge brought that training to his A&R for the label, helping to create a name and aesthetic that continues to resonate and inspire to this day both in its releases and on the dancefloor.
In this conversation as part of the Lisboa Electronica festival, Serge spoke with Lauren Martin about his formative years, founding and growing Clone and working with Detroit enigmas Drexciya.
Hosted by Lauren Martin Welcome. Welcome to this Red Bull Music Academy lecture as part of Lisboa Electronica. As a nice fact to warm up for this afternoon, today marks the 20th anniversary of the first ever RBMA lecture – yeah! I like the enthusiasm, thank you – which was with Jeff Mills in 1998 in Berlin. And it’s very appropriate that on the 20th anniversary we’re doing more lectures, and our guest with us this afternoon is kind of one of those people in dance music that’s been at the coalface of what’s important. A lot of people who get celebrated in underground electronic music are, true, the artist and DJs who are important, but the people who turn up to work every day and put in the effort to get these records out and into your hands and really completely change the culture, are the people that we want to talk to today. So please help me welcome Serge from Clone. Serge Thank you. Thank you. Lauren Martin So have you always been just Serge? Serge Well, no. I used to play in the local club, that was in 1988. When you guys were starting with the lectures, I was playing in the local club. And I had a V of my family name behind, Serge V, but I skipped the “V” at some point and was just my first name. I was never creative enough to find some cool name. Lauren Martin So you’re like the electric Cher or Britney as one name. Serge Something like that. Yeah. Lauren Martin And what were you doing under the name Serge in these clubs? Paint us a picture of where you were and what kind of music you were playing at the time. Serge Well, there was kind of all over the place because I started in the local club and it was just a commercial club in ’88, ’89 and it was like on holiday. I’m coming from the coast, coastal island in Holland on the southwest. And in the winter there are living like 15 thousand, 20 thousand people. In the summer it was like 500 thousand, and you have like six clubs in the little town and all open for like four months, six, seven days a week. And I started as a live jockey and one of them bought my records a Friday night and asked them if I could play them and the local DJ always played a couple of cool tunes and I knew he had them. So I was asking him if he could play them, and on some Friday I brought some records out: “Could you play this?” “Ah, put them on yourself. I’ll go drink a beer.” So that’s how I started down there. But they also played like all kind of stuff. So it went from commercial Top 40 tunes to very unknown, underground US import stuff. And that went on. I’ve been playing there for like I think until like ’94, ’95, something like that. Probably ’94. So we played gabber. We played Snap!, “Rhythm Is A Dancer.” We played all the cool old Chicago releases. So those are like quite various, what we played. Quite versatile. Even the early trance stuff from Frankfurt and that kind of stuff. Lauren Martin So when you say it was a commercial club, it wasn’t just like commercial like Top 40 stuff like you were saying. You were also balancing with quite hard and cutting edge kind of thing. Serge Yeah, we could play almost anything there as long as the dancefloor was full. And we were three DJs, and I had my personal taste, so I always tried to play my own records that I brought. I think a lot of people these days don’t know how it was back then. But very often the club used to buy the records. So you went to the record shop with the club owner, and he paid for all the records. But he never wanted to buy the records that I liked, so I bought them myself and sneaked them in and played them in the club anyway. So I took them myself. And that was back then, it was always the more Detroit stuff that he didn’t want to pay for. “No, we can’t play that.” And he bought a bit more commercial things, so I bought the Transmat stuff and KMS and the old warehouse records from Armando and Ron Trent. So that kind of a mixture kind of thing. That slowly became more commercial because he had to make some money. And my taste went another way, because the whole music scene was kind of splitting up. You could get a lot of subgenres. So you get the Chicago house, Detroit acid or Detroit techno and more acid stuff, electro things. I started to play more of my own stuff, but I couldn’t play everything there myself. So at some point I hooked up with guys in the Hague, from Acid Planet, Guy [Tavares] from Bunker, and I started playing there as well. So I was like doing two different gigs. I was playing this commercial club, and I was playing in the most obscure, underground parties in Holland as well. Lauren Martin That’s so interesting that you’re almost at the mercy of the club owner for what records that were getting brought in. If you weren’t getting them through him, because he didn’t like what you wanted to play, where were you getting your records from? Was it mostly through other places in the Netherlands, or were you looking to abroad? Because this is like late ’80s, so how does that work for you? Serge Yeah it was like late ’80s, early ’90s. Well, you had a couple of import shops and because we were on the south side of Holland, southwest side, we did go to Antwerp, Belgium. We did go to Rotterdam. So we’re kind of in the middle between Antwerp and Rotterdam, so we did visit both cities. Every other week, we went to Antwerp and the other week we went to Rotterdam and bought stuff down there. And the most import shops did have all of it, so they had the really obscure stuff but also the more commercial stuff. And that’s also what we played. And mostly if you did go to a regular club – like the most famous house club in Holland was Roxy – even down there you heard the Trax releases, obscure house music. But also like the hip-house stuff, which was a little bit more commercial. So everything was played in one night. You even could play like if the DJ fancied it, he’d played it like a regular record or whatever, just as long as it matched in with the vibe of the night. Lauren Martin If you were traveling to Antwerp and other cities in the Netherlands to get this music, it kind of makes it sound like it’s like your band of merry men. Like, “We’re the only ones that like this stuff.” Was there an appetite for it in the Netherlands at the time? Serge Yeah, definitely. There was a large scene in Holland and Belgium for the very new, modern records coming from the US, but also a lot of producers in our area. So it was very lively. A lot of new and exciting things were happening. Very obscure records made it to the charts as well, like ’88, probably like the momentum for the new beats stuff. And obscure Chicago house records made it to the charts as well, and major companies started to sign obscure techno records. So it become more, it was kind of mingling over with the major label stuff. Lauren Martin When you said that there’s a like a splintering at that time between genres and what people were into, could you give us maybe examples of what people in the Hague might have been producing and listening to and maybe what people in Rotterdam might have been doing that was different. Serge I think the Hague, Rotterdam was more or less the same. The two cities are really close by, like 20 kilometers. Those two cities are more working class, so on the weekends people want to celebrate. So that gives different atmosphere. People are working hard during the week, and during the weekend they go out and forget about the work stress and whatever was going on, so they want to party. And that was the music being made in Rotterdam and the Hague a lot. But on the same time, you also had guys doing like really obscure stuff and very intimate music. So, it’s either... people always, you know, want to pinpoint... OK, this is coming from there. But all sorts of music were made everywhere. But I think the dominant thing in Holland or in Rotterdam and the Hague was like the harder techno at some point, and the really easy house stuff that was going down in the clubs. Lauren Martin Is there a track maybe from this pile of records you brought that you would like to play to illustrate that? Serge You know of course, I got some records that I want to play. But maybe, because most stuff that I brought and when things started splitting up, splintering as you said, is around, probably around ’91, ’92. So in ’91, ’92 you were getting the commercial trance stuff, also in the Britain, in the UK. In Holland, we did get the hard techno sounds, the gabber stuff, and the other side from the harder styles we did get the more mellow house stuff. And that sound was popularized quite fast, so around ’92, ’93, you had like two main streams in Holland. So it was like the harder, commercial gabber with the trance-y stuff and the dominant club house theme. At that point, I really felt like I was falling in between something, because I did like both of them. It was a lot of good music coming out, but it was hard to find in Holland around that time. And also in that period, ’91, ’92, a lot of really good releases were coming out from all kind of corners of the world. Underground Resistance started. Carl Craig started playing, Retroactive. A lot of people, a lot of guys produced and started their own label. And also the guys from Bunker started around ‘92, and that was also the period I started my label. And then a lot of producers from, I think it was like the second or maybe even the third generation, started producing music and put it out on vinyl and started playing that and organizing their own parties. So that’s also what was happening in Holland. And I think it’s good to start with the first record I did put out. And there was more and there was also the sound that we were into. It was like harder, acid stuff and alternative things that were like kind of counter-culture of the more commercial streams. More commercial club things going on. Lauren Martin [pulls out record] You do the honors. Serge Yes. I’ll put my mic down. Lauren Martin OK. So what exactly is this record, then? Serge This is the first Clone release. I saved up some money and had a couple of tracks that I made with and also with a friend, two friends actually. We shared a little studio, and I did release a 12" on the label from I-f, the Guy from Bunker releasing music, so we had a small group of people putting out music. And I thought, “Well, OK.” I saved some money. I did a couple of jobs, and I thought, well, I see the other guys doing it, let’s just send the DAT to the manufacturing and I’ll pay the bill and we’ll see where it goes from there. And we can play the tracks at the party. Because back then you needed to have vinyl to be able to play them on a party. So it was kind of essential to have a record out back then. Lauren Martin So what’s the title of this track that we’re going listen to? Serge No titles. Lauren Martin Extra underground. Sorry. Serge Yeah. I think I made some kind of... It was “Coördinated Sounds & Sequences,” that’s the B title. Because I, well, didn’t have any names and I think I marked them C.11 for the first record, 1.2 for the second one and up to four, and then second release had like 2.1, 2... Lauren Martin Why all the sequencing, rather than giving it track titles? Serge Because we were making a lot of tracks and it was just tracks, and while we didn’t put up names we just gave them a number like the classical works, Opus 1, Opus 2. And I just gave them a number 1.1 for the first release and the second release. But the titles are not even on the record. I don’t think they were on the second and the third and forth records. It was all no titles, just EP name and that’s it. Well OK. Lauren Martin Let’s listen to that. Serge I’ll put the sound a bit down. (music: Orx – “Coördinated Sounds & Sequences”) Lauren Martin OK, yeah, great. When you say “obviously” this is not the kind of stuff that I could play in the club, it’s not so obvious to me maybe. Why? Serge Well, maybe not these days, but back then like asking what devils go in the club was like well, it’s not really... Like, Snap!, “Rhythm Is a Dancer” or like the things that made it to the chart, like Farley “Jackmaster” Funk, “Love Can’t Turn Around.” You had some acid stuff, but it was all more like gimmicky. This was more like dark. This is the stuff you listen to in a dark basement, with a strobe light and a lot of smoke and just forget about everything. In a regular club it’s, you know, cozy, people drinking beer, you know, chatting up with girls or whatever. That’s a little bit the vibe in most clubs. Sometimes you can rave, but this was a completely different atmosphere. Lauren Martin What year did release this in? Serge I think, well, this was the first release and I think it came out the end of ‘92, so early ‘92 we got everything ready. We sent it out, the whole manufacturing process. This was being produced in Czech Republic. I didn’t even know it was Republic back then, and it was Czechoslovakia back then, close to Prague, so it was Eastern Germany, right? Probably before the wall. I don’t even know. Doesn’t matter. So it was like really thick vinyl, and the quality is not actually that good, but we really liked the thickness of the vinyl. And it was like a really obscure manufacturing, and I don’t think we had to pay the mechanical royalties. So that’s why we pressed up there, so we could save couple hundred Euros, Guilders, back then, yeah. Lauren Martin So you started the label in ‘92, was that originally with the intent of releasing your own music first? Was that the idea? Serge Actually yes, yeah. Because I was sending demos to some other labels and I already thought, “Well, OK, that’s kind of a hassle.” Because you have to wait, you know, and get approval from them and you know what they like, what they think of it. So I just thought, let’s just do it myself. I had a couple of good examples because most of the labels that I did like, Underground Resistance was one of them, and a lot of good producers from Chicago in the late ’80s, they all had their own small labels. You know, just saved up some money and press the record, without the idea of starting a popular record label company behind it. You know, of course there were labels making a lot of money and doing it the more commercial way. But like Underground Resistance, just press a record with no information, blank label and just UR0004. That’s it, that’s all the info you had. And that was the stuff I was really attracted to, because the techno music that we liked had a certain aesthetic that I liked, that were a part of the techno sound in that time. So I thought, well I’ll just press up some records and then no plan behind it. Lauren Martin It’s interesting that you say that there wasn’t a lot of information about these records when they were coming out at the time, like Underground Resistance. But there was information, but it was just highly aestheticized, like precise information. Like, calling records Acid Rain, and having like messages carved in the runout. The information that you could get was solely on the record itself. There was no press or PR, there was just inlays and insert labels. Was that inspiring for you? Serge Yeah that was the kind of thing that was going on, because it was just about the music. And there was a little message that you could give the record, but it was kind of counterculture of the whole commercial scene and what was going on with the major labels. That was kind of the part that, part of the techno culture I think, and also the tradition that we got now that’s going on in techno. We were kind of following that aesthetics world, we were a part of that whole thing. We didn’t feel any urge to put information on there, why should we put down a phone number? Or why... we didn’t have email back then, so why put on any information? Later, I think later we put a fax number or something like that. There was like a whole scene with people making fanzines, like you know small magazines, and stuff like that. So you could connect and you knew where the parties were and people were meeting up in record stores. So it was kind of, people had to listen to the music and it was not important who was behind it. Or who made it. And you could make a little, sort of Acid Rain and you’d probably get something like pretty raw or something. So you could get a little vibe from the music with label art or, you know, the information that was not there. That’s what we did as well. Lauren Martin When did you give the Clone label a physical home? You mentioned that you linked up with a skate shop? Originally in ’94... ’93, ’94? Serge I think it was a bit later. In ’93 or ’94 I think I-f opened his shop, Hotmix in the Hague, which was kind of our club shop, our clubhouse, if you can all call it like that. Guy from Bunker was living in the Hague, I-f was living close to the Hague, so we hang out in his shop. We all had our label and our small things we were playing at parties and during the weekends. He closed down, I think, end of ’93. He was only open for like one half year, very short. There was no replacement at some point, so I just opened my small shop. We still had some stock left from the release we did on our own labels. And I just rented small space and opened the record shop. Lauren Martin I remember you saying there was something to do, there was like a connection to skateboarding in the early days. Like skaters would come in the shop, or it was linked to like a local kind of skate crew. Was that part of the culture integral to like early days of Clone at all? Serge Not really. It was just a coincidence that I could join that location. I was a surfer, I could skate a little bit. I used to be almost full-time surfer because I was living and I didn’t do much else in my teenage years until music grabbed me. But you know, yeah, well, skateboarding is an urban thing as well, so it fits kind of to the techno thing as well. A lot of people like Jeff Mills used to skateboard as well. He was the old guy back in Detroit, he was skating instead of being a gang member. And skateboarding is a thing that is pretty good for a lot of kids in cities. Lauren Martin I just got a really good image of Jeff Mills skateboarding. It’s great, thanks for that. That’s great. Tell me about the early days of the record shop thing. Because if you started the label to release your own music, when did you make kind of that editorial decision to open a shop and cultivate this entity? Serge Well, it all went kind of natural. Because I was trekking to Germany quite a lot in that period, because of a girl who was living in Frankfurt. [laughs] And well you know, that’s the reason why I was visiting Frankfurt quite a lot, and you had a couple good distributors down there. Those distributors sold my records, so I went there, sold them my records and I could buy them, I could buy some import stuff there as well. And in that time you had a lot of imports that local shops in Holland didn’t buy anymore, because it was too obscure. Because we had lost two big commercial streams, streamings that were like dominating, and that was falling in between. And that was mainly all the old Detroit techno that I liked so much that I couldn’t get and I bought it down there. Also a lot of good house music was being made in that period. I bought those copies down there, and I bought some copies for friends, so, well, OK I take two and then I just sell it to my buddy. At some point I thought, well, OK, I know these guys with the skate shop, and I’ll just start something there and we’ll see. I’ll just open three days in the week. You know, it went kind of naturally. Lauren Martin I know that because you were a DJ when you started out, I wonder how much the DJing came full-circle in the early days of the shop. Were you in the shop, being like the DJ salesman, putting records on and going, “Come on, this sounds really good”? Serge People didn’t know much about DJs then. I mean, a DJ was kind of a shitty job for a lot of people, you know? A bartender made more money than a DJ. And I think I was making like 40 Guilders, so there’s like 20 Euros for a night DJing. And at the end of the night I, the DJ’s task was to clean all the ashtrays. So I had to pick all the ashtrays in the venue and clean them and put them back. That was my job, after, you know, after the club was closed. And you know the bartender cleaned the bar and the doorman was sweeping the floor. So everyone had a task in the club, and my task was doing the ashtrays. Lauren Martin Nice. Serge For 40 Guilders a night. Lauren Martin So obviously DJing wasn’t particularly lucrative or well-regarded. So the shop and the label then was a way to anchor yourself in Rotterdam as this place where you could get imported records, or like you say, the records that people didn’t really want from like the chilled out house, and then the harder gabber stuff. Do you think that when you started the shop people were coming in and going, “What’s this?” Serge Yeah, totally. A lot of people came in. I was located around the corner from the main shopping street, the main record shopping street in Rotterdam back then. I think we had about five or six import shops or stores that were selling dance music. One of the main ones was Hotsound, who were having their own labels. Mid-Town selling the gabber stuff, Mid-Town was like the main gabber shop, and they also sell the commercial house stuff. Then, well, there was a drum & bass shop, and everyone had their own thing. So I was kid of the odd one in-between them. Selling the strange stuff, like electro stuff and records they, the guys, thought, “Who’s buying this kind of stuff?” But I knew, because I was playing at those underground parties and I was having friends. And it was also like a small scene of people collecting records. So there was like a pretty lively scene of record collectors. That’s how I knew, people like Gerd, he was a record collector. Speedy J, Jochem Paap, was a collector. A couple of guys working for me, I knew from back then, when I was looking in the local magazines, and they were selling records. I went to their houses, they were all still living with their parents and they met up. And we swapped records because they were looking for this and I was looking for that so we made a deal. Or changed synthesizers of stuff like that. So that’s how we then meet people. So there was some kind of scene you did meet each other. When Underground Resistance or Larry Heard was playing, you saw all the familiar faces. So you were making friends as well but you know in like, in-person. Lauren Martin So you started to make friends, people like Gerd Janson, through the pages of like, a nerdy magazine? Serge Not Gerd Janson, it’s Gerd [Dutch house music producer]. Gerd was like the local producer, he was doing a lot of music. He’s still doing a lot of music. Yeah, they’re getting confused a lot. Gerd Janson said that he owed a lot of gigs to Gerd, because a lot of people knew Gerd’s record but a lot of people knew Gerd Janson as a DJ. So they thought that he also produced those records, but... Lauren Martin How long was it before he started to tell people, “I’m not actually that guy”? Serge I’m not sure if he ever told them. Lauren Martin You’re swindled, Gerd. Is there something that we can listen to then from that time that you’ve got that could just get us all in the mood? Because you talk about a lot of genres, a lot of splintering off. Serge Yeah Lauren Martin Even the shops seem a little bit tribal, so maybe there’s something we could play that really reminds you of that time. Serge Yeah, let me think, because we’re talking about like ’94, I think the first Drexciya releases came out around that time. Drexciya, Ectomorph, Underground Resistance, those kinds of things. Also a lot of good house records came out, like Ron Trent, Prescription, with his label. A lot of guys in New Jersey put out a lot of really good house records. So it was an era with a lot of good stuff. So maybe Drexciya I think, or let me see what we got here. Lauren Martin Because we are definitely going to talk about Drexciya later on, for sure. Serge OK, well maybe let’s do a very odd one. We haven’t discussed that one before, but it’s a nice, really strange record coming out in that time that was like, really odd. Especially if you figure out the timer, people... You could make a lot of money selling records. So a lot of producers are making records and made a lot of money back then, and are easily attracted to the techno scene, or the more commercial techno scene, or the house. But then all of a sudden you had some guys doing stuff that was really, completely crazy. Let me see. Put this on. Lauren Martin And what’s this called? Serge This is Glass Domain, “Interlock.” (music: Glass Domain – “Interlock”) I like that part. Lauren Martin There’s always another good part. Serge Yeah, yeah. Lauren Martin There’s always another good part. Serge Well, not always, but with good records, it is, yeah. Lauren Martin So, what was that record there? Tell us about who was making that. Serge This is Glass Domain. Now it’s no secret anymore. It’s Gerald from Dopplereffekt, Gerald Donald who made this. He’s also talking about Lego blocks, being creative, looking for new stuff, making music that he likes or that’s a creative expression. When you hear this, when everyone is looking for club tunes and the big records and the next chart hit. That was the golden thing for DJs, was having the next big club hit before anyone else had it. So if you were able to buy an obscure US imports release, which probably came out four or five, six months later on the European label, you could already play it for like four or five months in your club before anyone else could play it. So everyone was looking for that kind of records. And then, all of a sudden you hear this record in a record shop. Most buyers didn’t even care for it. But when I heard the stuff... And I must be honest, I didn’t hear this at that time, because it was too obscure. We couldn’t find it in Holland. I don’t think this even made it outside of Detroit back then. But this is one of the guys from Drexciya, and we knew Drexciya. We heard records from Drexciya and Ectomorph and those guys. So we were completely excited when we heard crazy stuff like this, like guys doing other things. Not looking for the next club hit, but just being creative and expressing themselves and doing stuff that they liked. Well, that was when some kind of click was being made that we thought, “Well, OK, there are more people doing this.” And there was people in Detroit making electro music. Well, around the same time, we were making electro stuff as well. And nowadays, when you listen to a lot of music on YouTube, you can find the most crazy, obscure stuff. But back then, it was kind of hard finding different music. Finding something that was strange and obscure that fell into your niche. So finding these records, well, it was very exciting back then. And you couldn’t find these in most regular record stores, not even Drexciya. That’s the stuff that I love to sell, just because I liked it. Lauren Martin So maybe moving from Clone as a label and then a record shop, was this kind of like the editorial impetus to start being a distributor? Because if you’re finding it hard to get a conversation going so much between electro in the States and electro that’s happening in the Netherlands, was becoming a distributor part of the way for you to go, “Right, this is how we’re going to facilitate this relationship”? Serge No, that was only later, I think. Yeah, because at first we started just because we were enthusiastic about this stuff. When I opened the shop, the label work slowed down. But at some point, I was meeting more people in the shop and I got more demos. So at some point, I think it was like really seven, I started releasing music from other people. Actually, all of the first six, seven, or maybe even eight release were all by myself. And from there, I started releasing other people’s music. And then I had to make agreements and deals with people, so it became more official. Now I had this shop, as well. And my aim at the shop was selling records that I liked. And I liked this stuff, and I liked Axis, Minimal Nation, that kind of stuff. And they simply didn’t sell it in the other shops, because those were not things that were running in most regular clubs except for a couple of small, underground places. And so this is kind of how the whole thing started. We were rolling, and I was trying to get these records in my shop. And the distribution parts only... I think it happened like ’89 or something. Lauren Martin When you had your first run of releases in the label that were all by yourself, when you started to release music from other people, were the local producers coming into the shop with their demos and saying, “Oh, please listen to this”? Serge Yeah, yeah. Well, it was like a kind of network with friends. Like Facebook without a computer. So you knew each other and they showed it, but in person. So they said, “Oh, listen to this,” just because they liked to play it for you. And then, after a while, I thought, “This is good stuff. People should hear it. I really liked that, and I should put it up because now I can play it at parties as well.” And so that’s a bit how it started. And then, I started to do releases by I-f and a couple of friends... I think it was number seven or number eight, the Brothers Fuck & Friend. And then, I had a Pamétex release. Then things slowly started to become an official record label. Lauren Martin Things escalated. Serge It escalated. Lauren Martin Very quickly. Serge Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lauren Martin It’s good that you mentioned other labels trying to search for hits, because there’s an interesting turning point in the early 2000s for Clone that I wanted to play a track of, and perhaps we could discuss it. Because I feel a big part of the enduring appeal of Clone is its ability to shape-shift and maybe move through trains and around them, also absorb them in their own way. So I have a track that I’m going to play. And I didn’t tell you that I was bringing this, in case you decide you didn’t want to hear it. Could you put the laptop on? That would be great. (music: ADULT. – “Hand to Phone”) You were just saying that you haven’t heard that song in a long time. Serge No. Lauren Martin What was that song? Serge Sorry? Lauren Martin What was that song? Serge This is ADULT., “Hand to Phone.” It was on that first 12" we released by them. Lauren Martin I played this because it’s a really interesting turning point, I think, in the history of Clone. This was released in 2001, and then again as remixes in 2002. And that same year, it was on the 2 Many DJ’s As Heard record. It was like the quintessential mashup album of the time, and that was featured on it. And when we’re talking a lot about electro and the different styles from the US, from the Netherlands. And then, creeping in at the start of the millennium, there is this early electroclash sound, which is quite different and which I-f had an early hand in. Can you tell us a little bit about the impact that this record had on Clone, as an entity? Like, did you get a lot of interest from record buyers about this label? I’d be really interested to know more about it. Serge Yeah, I actually have to think about how it was back then, because things already slowly started to grow. The shop became bigger. We attracted a lot of customers from outside of Holland, so a lot of people from Belgium, Germany came buying records. We were putting out a bit more records. I think it was release number 14. We were doing more parties, so the whole network became a bit bigger. We were releasing electro records, but also techno records. I got another here that we’re going to play later that was like a completely different direction, but all very valuable to me and very dear. But all of a sudden, this and other records in that era are being picked out by the club scene and popular DJs and by the fresh ink press, as well. So all of a sudden, it became... the whole electro thing became some kind of revival thing, and it became some kind of fashion. Which was kind of odd, because fashion is the last thing we wanted to be and that we were attracted to with the techno music that we liked. So we were kind of pulled into a whole scene that we never used to be part of. This was one of the big hits in that time. This one, “Hand to Phone,” I-f with “Space Invaders [Are Smoking Grass]” had a big hit. Dexter, “I Don’t Care”; Alden Tyrell, “Love Explosion”; and a couple of other things. All records from our crew, our scene, became kind of gold hits. And Miss Kittin & the Hacker from Munich, they had their big hit. It was kind of that era. Lauren Martin Did you find that record shops who perhaps hadn’t really picked up on what you were doing with electro had started because of big records like this, coming to you and going, “Do you have more of this stuff?” Like, did it change the conversations that you were having with other record shops in Europe or further abroad? Serge Yeah, well, not... Yeah, kind of. But also the record label. I saw a lot of record labels start putting out music that sounded like this. Because you could make money with selling records, so they thought was, “If this is selling, we can make another good record that sounds like this and just sell equal numbers.” And it did get a commercial kind of twist, a commercial flavor around it. We were talking with major record companies who were interested in doing a full-length album by Dexter, or I-f, or Alden Tyrell, or ADULT. So yeah, things became slightly different than they were. Lauren Martin You said you were approached by major labels to put out albums from these other artists. What was your reaction, because it seems like Clone has very much always been its own creature. How did you navigate that thing? Serge Well, I always tried to stay true to the thing that I liked and to what felt good. Also, most of the artists I’m working with had the same kind of thing, and we stayed true to our own aesthetics and ethics as well. And kept doing what we enjoyed doing, and that was making music and releasing and playing music that we liked. And this whole electroclash kind of thing did put us in a lot of spotlights. And all of a sudden, I was playing fashion parties with models and coke and whatever was going on in those parties that before we only knew from movies. All of a sudden, we were in between those parties, but it felt kind of odd. And so I always kept a distance from that whole electroclash scene. And there were a lot of record companies that became very popular, like Gigolo Records. They’ve completely jumped on that whole movement and started putting out more records that sounded like things that were a hit. And so I always kepy my distance from that and just kept doing what I liked. Lauren Martin Around that time, then, what were you doing that was a slight counter to that narrative? What else were you doing? Because this was a time when Clone started to really diverge from putting out kind of smoother, almost like disco style things. Italo disco going on at roughly the same time. Serge That was more or less the same time that the Italo disco thing also came back. Guys like Legowelt, we got his record here, was making tracks that had some electro, Italo disco influences. But we played everything that we liked, so we played Afrika Bambaataa at an acid squat party and we played obscure electronic disco at those parties as well. So a lot of things were going all together on the same night. It was still kind of versatile. And, of course, there were parties were you only played banging acid stuff. But even there you played some electro in between or some crazy stuff in between, some Drexciya. So it was always kind of versatile. It was never the whole night, just straight-on Berghain kind of techno. Like, we wonder what you got now in Berghain, the whole night, same sound. You don’t even know if it’s one o’clock or six or 10 in the morning. Lauren Martin I think that’s part of the fun, though, right? Serge It was always boring to me. During the night, you always... The energy goes up and down. So if you come in, you are in a different mood and different energy than at 6 AM, and at 10 AM it’s again a different mood. So if the music goes on in a straight line, and... So we perfectly could play all those different styles and things on a certain night. And those electroclash parties, it was the whole night only hits and chart stuff and popular music. And at that time, we released house records that were completely different than, people didn’t truly understand. “Oh, but yeah, you are the guys from the obscure electro stuff,” or, “Why do you put out house music?” Well, just because we like it. Lauren Martin Speaking of things you like, let’s go back to Detroit and talk about... Maybe a defining feature of Clone is not only the music that you’ve released yourselves, but the music that you’ve sought out and reissued. And that’s been a huge part of what you’ve done. Can we listen to Detroit in Effect? Serge Yeah, yeah. Of course, yeah. Yeah, that’s also quite early. That was like ’86, ’87, or ’96, ’97. Lauren Martin This Detroit in Effect record originally came out in ’97 on Detroit label, is it MAP or MEP? Serge Yeah. Lauren Martin And then you re-released it on Clone in 2003. So this is the year after the Soulwax album that put out ADULT. in the mix. Serge Yeah. Lauren Martin So this is like a year apart, this has all happening. Serge Yeah. OK. You know your facts. Lauren Martin Yes, that’s my job. Serge Well done. Good. I don’t know which side it is, because it’s the test pressing. So I’ll have to gamble if it’s this side or the other one. (music: Detroit in Effect – unknown track) Lauren Martin So what were we just listening to there? Serge That’s Detroit in Effect, The Men You’ll Never See. And this record came in... I recently did a small post about this, actually about this record on my Facebook. It came out via import. We never heard it before. So we just order records from the list from the US distributors. And once a week, once every two weeks, we got a US import delivery. And these here records on there, MAP Records, Detroit in Effect, The Men You’ll Never See. So we had no idea, but it sounds kind of cool, so I ordered probably five copies because we had to be careful, otherwise it did cost me money. At that time, we didn’t have much, and five copies in my small shop was still quite a lot. I did receive a box with these records in it. I always was excited opening the US imports. So I opened it and then I heard this for the first time. I was like, “Whoa.” That’s stuff I don’t hear here. No one is making this kind of stuff in Europe. And this was like classic stuff, but still different than a lot of things being made. It has some reference to “Cosmic Cars” by Cybotron. So these guys knew the classics, but it sounded different. It was fast. It was more like techno. I also liked the vocals. The Men You’ll Never See, which was making techno tracks by guys who were not in the limelight, so not in the spotlights. So these guys made a tune that kind of fit into the whole vibe that we liked. And not the electroclash thing going on in that time at popular fashion parties, but completely the opposite. These guys made music that they liked. And we became friends. ADULT. made a remix, Electronome, I-f, so I think that was the first license I did for the label. Signing music that was out before and remix it, that was like the first project I did. Well, I still like it a lot. Lauren Martin The reissues that Clone has done, like this one and many, many, many others... How much of a conscious decision do you make with finding these older electro records and bringing them into the fore and putting them out for popular – well, popular-ish – consumption again? Is this in a kind of sense a way to, not only just let people hear music, but to create a narrative of electro that you can control and you think is of a quality that deserves to be heard? Serge There’s records that we couldn’t find and that were important. So I thought I should make them available again, because it’s records that I used to play a lot, and that I thought were important records and very good records that people should know about and that are part of the whole culture and about the whole history of house and techno music. For me, it’s always the same. House and techno, electro, it’s just one thing. I never divided it much. So we started making contacts with people. This was like one of the first things. But then I thought, “OK, maybe we should do more official and make like a label focusing on reissues of tracks that are classics that are important.” So we started with Mike Dunn, MDIII – “Face the Nation.” A couple of, they call it, disco releases. And slowly we had a reissue where we were repressing, remastering, and re-releasing old house and techno records. And electro, as well. Lauren Martin Staying in Detroit, as we mentioned a couple of times before – we won’t keep people holding on any longer – the relationship that you’ve built up with Drexciya over the years has been of paramount importance to the history of Clone. You released the Grava 4 album in 2004, and it was the first time it had been released... No, it wasn’t 2004. Serge I don’t know the date. Lauren Martin OK, hang on. Serge Probably like 2002. I actually don’t know. Lauren Martin It would’ve been 2002, because that was the same year that James Stinson passed away. Serge Yeah, must be. Yeah. Lauren Martin When you decided to have a relationship with Drexciya and build that up and release those records, how did you start that conversation? Did you approach the duo and say that you wanted to do this? Where did this interest come from? Serge I have to think. It was a small network, so we knew people in Detroit. We were friends with others who were making records, so it was a small network. Also people in Glasgow, people in Italy, in Rome mainly, Germany, Detroit, Miami. And it was just a small network. The Internet got a role in that, as well, because it was also around the era that the Internet became more accessible and more mainstream. So a lot of artists and people had their own website. I don’t know what the first contact was, or how that did go. I remember the first time I spoke to him, but I think it probably was an email after he noticed our website or something. I don’t know how the first contact was made, and then he offered new music. I was already working with ADULT. and a couple of other people, so they already knew about Clone Records. We invited some people coming over, so they knew about us. Drexciya guys knew that we were doing a label. And he wanted to release some music, and he approached me. And that’s how we made our first deals. Lauren Martin What kind of conversations did you have with Drexciya about maintaining the integrity of their narrative, and their ideas, and their aesthetic? Serge Not. Lauren Martin None? Serge Not. Lauren Martin Was it just kind of like an unspoken rule that you would completely honor everything that they gave you, or did you discuss – Serge Well, it was just part of the whole thing. It was anonymous. Nobody knew who was behind it. And it was like that record, The Men You’ll Never See. And in those years, there was almost no fame. You could become famous if you were like Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson. But most people only knew the music. Nowadays, it’s the other way around. You know the people, but you don’t know what kind of music they make. So you know, for example, Peggy Gou. I knew Peggy Gou from the Internet, Facebook, because she showed up in my timeline. I saw, before I knew who she was, and I had no idea what kind of music she was playing and what kind of records she made. But I saw her in my timeline a couple of times, passing, coming by. And I knew about Peggy Gou, but I had no idea what she was doing. Back then, it was completely the other way around. Everyone knew “Cosmic Cars” by Cybotron. Everyone knew all the Model 500, but no one knew Juan Atkins. Nobody knew who was behind Detroit in Effect. Nobody knew who was behind Drexciya. Underground Resistance was a bit more known. But you all knew the records. So it was the other way around. And there was no discussion about talking who made those records. It was kind of obscure. And I think only we kind of followed what he was doing. So if he spoke about a new project, or I think he came out in public with his Seven Storms that he was going to release, seven full-length albums. So there was information that he gave to the outside world. So that was the information we had that we also shared. But we never shared who he was or what he was doing, what kind of job he had or whatever. It wasn’t all important. Lauren Martin When you released the Grava 4 album, that was you being given music and you released it on good faith. But the later years with classic cuts between 2011 and 2014, when you reissued Drexciya records, but you did have a much more hands-on time with those records because a lot of them were remastered, correct? Serge Yeah. Lauren Martin Yeah. Serge Yeah, but you also had to do a lot of work with the graphic art. The business was not like friends coming in the record shop and giving you a tape. It was like a proper label already. There was money involved. I mean, we had to pay a large advance for that, as well. And we had to make promotion. We had to sell a certain amount of copies to make it worth doing. So it was like more professional already in those years. We were talking with major record companies with those ADULT. things and making deals and getting a lot of licenses, so the business was already mature. So the question was? Oh yeah, yeah. No, the Grava 4 only came in the years after that. Grava 4 was first, then we did another one, Lab Rat XL. We were talking to other guys about reissuing stuff, but also releasing new music from other people from Detroit and Miami and all over the world. And it was like a regular, kind of regular label business thing. Lauren Martin There’s someone that’s not here with us whose also really important to the integral story of Clone, that’s Alden Tyrell. Serge Yeah. Lauren Martin And I think we should speak about him. Serge Yes, of course. Lauren Martin Who is Alden Tyrell? For those who may not be so familiar. Serge Alden Tyrell is a friend of mine, we became friends through the record shop. He came in with a friend of his, well just a regular customer. We did meet at parties and stuff like that. And then I think he gave me a tape, or a friend of his gave me a tape with music he was making. He had all of this good stuff, so like a lot of those stories, we started talking with him and we came to our first record that he did put out. There was, I think the EP was called Obsession or the track on there was “Obsession.” But he was doing a lot of electro stuff; he was a very talented producer. He was doing very good electro stuff, he was doing some disco stuff. But he actually was like a hip-hop guy. He was like very much into hip-hop and he looked like a hip-hop guy, he was behaving like a hip-hop guy. Lauren Martin What do you look like when you met him, how did he look like a hip-hop guy? Serge You know, Air Jordans and baggy trousers and you know, bit of... Lauren Martin So not electroclash at all? Serge Not electroclash at all, no. No. But nobody was like... what’s electroclash? Nobody was like, Danny Legowelt was complete different. I was like more a surfer kind of guy. I-f was I-f and the other guys... That was also an important part of our scene, the guys in the north part of Holland, on the coastal part there, with Cosmic Force. So we were like all completely different characters. But we got along because of the music. We had the same taste and the same aesthetics there. So Alden Tyrell, we became friends. We put out a couple of records and he’s really like a producer kind of guy, doing really good stuff. At some point we got a couple of records that also was in that timeframe with the electroclash, and he was doing a lot of different things. We also shared a love for the modern electronics, like Autechre, Aphex Twin, that kind of stuff. That’s something we are not talking about here, but there was also this proper techno stuff, and we were always looking forward to what was coming next. And that was for us, the last level in techno music, Autechre, Aphex Twin. The latest electronical developments, the latest software mix came along. So that was like the last frontier for us for electronic music. And Alden Tyrell was very skilled and very talented. A lot of really good records, very high-tech but on the other side he was the most kind of retro kind of things. But because he was so skilled in the production side, he started doing mastering for us. And that’s the thing that you told me before that you wanted to talk about in correlation to the Drexciya thing. Lauren Martin So, Alden Tyrell was kind of brought into the Clone way of doing things and was mastering and engineering records including the Sea Dweller CDs from Drexciya that you did on Clone Classic Cuts from 2011-2014. Serge Yep. Lauren Martin And I kind of want to give people a sense of, when people may have potentially heard Drexciya on vinyl for the first time in their own hands, there’s a very particular sound that Clone worked on though Alden Tyrell to make Drexciya sound the way they did for these reissues. But what we’re gonna do is we’re gonna play the same track from the original, from The Quest and then play the Clone remaster of it, so you can get a sense of the role that Clone plays in, not just putting the music out there in our hands, but actually affecting the very, like, fabric of the tracks. So what’s the track we’re gonna to compare and contrast? Serge I think you have “Red Hills of Lardossa.” Lauren Martin I do have the “Red Hills of Lardossa.” Let me just check if I have the right one, yeah. So what we are going to do is play both. Shall we play the older version first? Serge Yeah. Lauren Martin Yeah, so this is from The Quest. (music: Drexciya – “Red Hills of Lardossa” (original vinyl release and Clone reissue versions)) So I hope you got a sense of that. Those two different sounds, those tracks. Tell us a little more what Alden Tyrell was doing with these remasters and getting his hands on these tracks. How did the process work, and what was the thinking behind Clone going in and touching this music? Serge Well, I think I have to add, that’s played from the computer. I think it’s an MP3, so there is some difference. The difference is very big now. I think it’s less of a big difference if you played both vinyls, but that was a huge difference. It’s a little exaggerated with these two, but yeah, you can hear more space and more balance in the sound here. There are a couple of reasons. That has been mastered in Detroit, I think Ron Murphy did cut those, and he had a special way of mastering. We had the master tapes from all these tracks, so we just mastered it in a way we should do it now, we will do it nowadays. We heard a lot of things in the music that we didn’t hear before from the old records, so we thought, OK, if we are gonna reissue them, we should not present them the way they use to come out, like the original UR releases. Those UR releases are like magical records to us. The whole concept, the whole artwork thing, the whole story around the music. Also how they’d been mastered by Ron Murphy, because he got like certain aesthetics, he got a certain vision in the mastering as well. So we thought, well we cannot compete it or compare it with that. We should bring it in another context. So we just made a whole new playlist. We made four different releases out of the whole collection. The music got remastered, and we also want the people to hear the parts they couldn’t hear on the original releases. Or at least master them in a different way, so you could listen to them in probably the way they had been heard in the studio while being made. Because this is what you could hear in the studio when it was being made and not with Ron Murphy’s vision on it. So that’s a little bit what we wanted to do with new mastering and how we want to present it. Lauren Martin When you say there are certain things on these Drexciya tracks that were not being heard, what specifically do you mean? Could you give us an example of how Ron Murphy’s work may have been changed, or I’m not sure. I think it would be great if you could give us examples, because to go in and change someone’s record is quite a fundamental thing. To bring certain things to the form and tone certain things down. Serge It is. Yeah, it is. But that’s also the thing with the mastering in Detroit from Ron Murphy. He was mastering things so you could play it very loud, and things had a certain wow edge to it. That’s also, I mean that’s part of the charm of it as well. But since we were doing reissues, we thought OK, we shouldn’t make it sound like those. We should make them sound as they sound in the studio, and just try to make them sound properly and including the low end and some mid freq, mid things that you normally got, like, pressed together so you could hear a couple of parts, you know small frequencies or things that were hidden in those Ron Murphy mastered versions. That’s what Alden Tyrell did; he did a good job I think. We did put a lot of time in it, especially Alden Tyrell put a lot of time in the mastering. It was a lot of work because it was all from the original tapes and multi tracks and well, at the end we had the full catalog reissued in a new sounding quality. Lauren Martin Do you feel a sense of responsibility when you’re doing these remastered works? Do you feel that, even if you’re able to get your hands on those tapes, is it something you fundamentally should do? If that makes sense. Serge Well, we had to make some couple of choices and we tried to do it, what felt best to us. We also discuss with a couple of people who were involved and we thought we shouldn’t reissue them as original UR releases or as the original version or the original track listing. So we tried, we tried to create a different way of listening to Drexciya. To keep the original ones, original ones intact, because those records, we can’t touch them. We don’t want to touch them, that’s like all the props are going, all the kudos is going to Mike Banks for that and also the guys making the music. So we tried to create a new context and, well... Lauren Martin And who is that new context for, do you think? Is this for people buy Clone records that don’t physically don’t want these old records? Serge Also for our self. Because we always look what we like and what we would like see, would like to do. And if you want to listen to Drexciya in a different way, I mean otherwise we would play the original records. So we want to have different way we also could listen and play them. That’s what we had in mind. And also, what would be a good reason for people to buy these records, even if you have a couple of the originals? So, it’s a very good reason having the original ones and the reissues if you’re really into Drexciya. We tried to figure out what best thing was to do and we came to this, to present the music in a clean, clear way without the whole story around it. Because that’s the whole legacy with Drexciya. We tried to keep that intact and just give her kind of, like maybe a little bit like, like I did with the first release, just give numbers to the tracks and let music do the talking and not give the whole image around it, because that was already done before by others. Lauren Martin So speaking of Alden Tyrell’s work, why don’t we listen to one of his own tracks? Serge Yes. Lauren Martin Let’s do that. Serge Yeah. Lauren Martin What have we brought? We’re just gonna have a listen. Serge Well, I don’t know how much time we’ve got left, we could do a disco one. We got plenty of time left? Lauren Martin It will be fine. Serge Yeah? Lauren Martin This is fun. Serge ’Cause there is one record I really want to play, because I know you like the disco thing. Lauren Martin I’ll make a concession. I’d be good, so people can hear Alden Tyrell’s work as a producer. That’s part of the Clone family, not just as his mastering work on other people’s records. So, what is this one? Serge Yeah, I mean. If I play this, you will hear his music, he’s always sounding massive. He’s doing a lot of techno stuff now, because he’s always moving forward and doesn’t want to repeat too much the same kind of thing. And so he has been doing a lot of disco, kind of really powerful disco stuff before and that’s a lot of people know him of. This is probably one of my favorite tracks of that “Disco Lunar Module.” (music: Alden Tyrell – “Disco Lunar Module”) This one was really heavy and dark. But in same time, he was also doing almost kitschy, campy kind of stuff, even those it wasn’t meant to be camp. I don’t think that’s the right word I picked. But especially knowing, knowing he was kind of hip-hop guy, going to all the early hip-hop shows in Holland and producing really, really heavy beats and really cool stuff, he was also doing this kind of stuff. (music: Alden Tyrell – unknown track) So it’s a little schizophrenic almost, being a hip-hop guy, wearing the latest, coolest Air Jordans and on the same side, making Italo disco kind of stuff. But that’s a little bit the thing that we all have. We are playing like really obscure electro stuff, but also really warm house records by Larry Heard. It’s not like, a scene or a genre or a style of thing that we belong to. It’s not like that you are belonging to a group. It was just about music. If it sounded good, it sounded good. Well, this sounded good. He was just having fun in the studio making disco tracks and he came to us with a tape, “Hey, I made some disco tracks.” “Wow, that’s cool. What’s that?” “Yeah, track’s I made.” “Wow, did you make that? I mean you made those really heavy hip-hop tracks and electro tunes.” Well, that’s a little bit, the whole vibe we had in that time and actually still we try to maintain and stay true. Lauren Martin Speaking of staying true, in 2009 you – maybe you weren’t fed up, I don’t know what you are thinking might have been – but you actually stopped doing Clone for a short period of time. You basically put out the announcement that Clone’s done for now and we were quite shocked. And then you didn’t stay done for very long, what happened when you came back with Clone in 2009, 2010? Serge Yeah it was, I don’t know. It was probably like a record label mid-life crisis kind of thing or something. It was a moment where you had, OK well, we’re doing so many different things. It’s kind of, almost – well, I use the term schizophrenic. It didn’t make sense to a lot of people. How can you put out this Italo disco tune, very, you know, playful and catchy, and Drexciya at the same time? What’s the link in that? A lot of people didn’t see the link. And we became older, but it was like a whole new generation coming into the music scene and interested in music. I felt that there was some disconnection, I couldn’t make the connection with them. I was thinking, what am I doing, I put out really good Scott Grooves record but people are, “Oh, are you putting out house stuff”? A lot of customers came in because of Drexciya or because of Alden Tyrell or because of Duplex or some Detroit techno records we were putting out. So it’s not like... you know there were a lot of expectations from people from outside and you feel that you don’t match the expectations they have. On one side, you don’t really care but on the other side, you always hear that in the shop. “Oh, new Clone, but why is that a house record? Because I thought you guys are an electro label.” So we got like a stamp on it that we were an electro label and we were never. We never tried to be an electro label, and the guys I was working with were just doing whatever they liked and we played whatever we liked. And still now, I’m not an electro DJ, I’m not a house DJ, I’m not a techno DJ. I just play whatever I like. Also from a DJ perspective, at my agent’s office, “Yeah, but you have to make a choice, become a house DJ or just play techno.” I can’t, because I like everything. And I think during the whole night, you can start with house stuff and end up with 140 BPM techno stuff or whatever. So, I can split it up myself as a DJ. I can... Well, I could make different artists’ names and play house on that part or play techno with that, alias, or how do you say it? Live with that name. But I felt that I had to change something with the label because I thought, at least I felt, that I couldn’t get deep enough into certain sounds. I couldn’t release music from really unknown artists who were doing like really cool stuff, but didn’t match the standard that we set for ourselves, because the label did become a professional label, whatever professional is. But a proper record label and things had to sound like proper as well. And then I got this really cool demo, and I thought, “Wow, but if I put that out, then I don’t know what people will think of it.” So I was starting to think in that way and I didn’t like it. I wanted the label to be pure and just release music that I like, even if it’s like really soft, melodic house or very introvert or whatever. So I thought, “OK, just stop and think of ways how to do it again, or maybe another way or maybe not at all. Maybe stop it all.” We kind of quit the whole operation, the label, how we were doing it. And in that time, we thought – well, I thought – of ways, how I could release those records of young artists again, and new producers, and young talented people who were doing different things and give them a platform where I could release their music. Even though they were not sounding like Alden Tyrell and didn’t have the production skills, so maybe find a way to get those records out. I thought the best way was sub-labels. Like make this small label more house-orientated, label more electro-orientated, a label for all the guys from the local scene and a techno label. They gave me a lot of freedom again to put out different stuff that was even more diverse. I thought it made it a little bit more understandable for the younger generations, who were just listening to techno stuff and they maybe didn’t listen to Larry Heard. Maybe they didn’t discover Larry Heard yet. But if you listen to techno music, or let’s say you buy the Clone Basement Series because you like the straight-on techno stuff little more, at some point you will discover Larry Heard, I’m sure. At some point. But it doesn’t match up on one label, at least not on the way we were doing it. Lauren Martin So how many of these sub-labels do you think you have by now? Do you even know? Serge Oh, I never counted. Probably 15 or something like that? Yeah. Some only have like two, three records, and others are like up to 30 or something now. Before now, probably the Clone Royal Oak series got like 42 records now. Yeah. Lauren Martin It’s actually really appropriate perhaps then that, as a DJ, you felt so pulled in so many directions that you don’t want to use different aliases for different kinds of sets. So instead of changing yourself as a DJ, you just mimicked your DJ interest back into the label, which is exactly how you started it, which is a DJ just wanting to play music that you liked and couldn’t get your hands on. Serge Yeah, totally, yeah. But it’s confusing for a lot of people. Like I said my booking agent said, “Wow, you should just stick to this or just stick to that.” And a lot of DJs have that, once you get to a certain level. You get booked for main stages, they expect you to play a certain thing. I always try to fight it and just, you know, play whatever I like to play. Lauren Martin Well, Clone has been fighting the good fight all this time. So, Serge, I want to thank you for your time today. Serge Thanks. [applause]

Wolfgang Voigt
If you were to find the words “Cologne” and “techno” in the same sentence, chances are a third word would follow almost automatically: Kompakt. A record shop and label, Kompakt was co-founded by local producer Wolfgang Voigt in 1993 under the name Delirium. That same year, inspired by the explosion of dance music in England, Voigt began releasing music as Mike Ink, the first in a long list of aliases including GAS, Freiland and Love Inc. Over the past 25 years, Voigt has created a complex cosmos of music in which he plays with and rearranges the sonic building blocks of genres. Best known for his contributions to the canon of minimal techno, Voigt’s work is ultimately larger than just a name or a single idea.
In this public conversation as part of the Red Bull Music Academy 20th Anniversary Tour in Germany, Voigt sat down with Hanna Bächer to delve deep into his vast catalog of music and the peculiarities of his creative process.
Hosted by Hanna Bächer A very warm welcome to Wolfgang Voigt! [applause] Wolfgang Voigt Hello, thank you. Good evening. Hanna Bächer The track we just listened to features you on vocals, in your mother tongue, is that right? Wolfgang Voigt Yes, it’s one of my vocal masterpieces, as you can easily tell. You started us off with a simple, very accessible piece, which is about St. Martin, as some people from Cologne might know. It’s about the traditional St. Martin’s procession which always takes place in November. It has been dear to me since I was a young child and I thought it was about time to acknowledge it through the means of electronic music. As a native of Cologne I had to do this myself, using my own voice. Hanna Bächer I liked it. Wolfgang Voigt Who else should have done it? I couldn’t find anyone. There are machines you can use… Hanna Bächer I enjoyed playing it, since we can almost see the area where you grew up in Cologne, just past those trees. [points out towards the city] Wolfgang Voigt Yes, a little more that way, on the other side of the Rhine. Hanna Bächer Where was that exactly? Wolfgang Voigt After the first five years of my childhood, [I lived in] Mühlheim, Cologne. Before that, in Ehrenfeld, Cologne. The first five years in Ehrenfeld and then Mühlheim. Hanna Bächer For people who don’t really know Cologne, originally it’s a Protestant area, which is rather unusual for Catholic Cologne. But then you moved to the northern part of the city? Wolfgang Voigt Yes, later, in the ’80s, when I was 18, I moved closer to the more civilized areas to broaden my horizons. Hanna Bächer Around that time in the ’80s, what kind of music influenced you? Specifically in Cologne, where did you go? Wolfgang Voigt It wasn’t necessarily connected to Cologne. In those days, I was influenced by music in general, and by the German avant-garde music of the time. I was fascinated by the Neue Deutsche Welle, coming from punk. In the early ’80s I was most impressed with Palais Schaumburg and DAF, which wasn’t specifically linked to Cologne. This style of music was very fascinating, it was a new German music phenomenon that used German language in pop music. However, it would be wrong to link it only to Cologne, it was everywhere. Hanna Bächer But, as you’ve said before, if you had come from a different place, it wouldn’t have made a difference to you. Wolfgang Voigt Yes, I like to point that out because the more recognition I got, the more I was reduced to my Cologne background. And suddenly I was considered to be a musical icon and guardian of the Cologne spirit. And I thought, “That’s too much.” I identify with Cologne a lot, I’m connected with the mentality, as you can also hear from my dialect, but I’m certainly not a local patriot. I like to be here and it’s my home, but it would have been the same case with any other region. I’m simply not the type who likes to move. Back then, many people moved to all kinds of places for artistic or musical reasons. I had the feeling that it was more important to most of these people, not to move somewhere, but to be able to go out somewhere else, and that was never an option for me. I like to be here and I will stay here as long as people let me. Hanna Bächer You made some very important friends and connections in those days, in the ’80s, like Jörg Burger and Jürgen Paape, whom you already knew through your brother. Wolfgang Voigt Right, yes. Hanna Bächer And some of these friends had bands, like Jörg Burger’s band Les Immer Essen. Was playing in a band ever an option for you, back then? Wolfgang Voigt Well, I also played in bands in those days because in the early ’80s, bands were simply the form of musical expression, one way or another. And in those days I got to know my long-time companion and friend Jörg Burger, who had a rehearsal room next to mine in a squat, the Stollwerk, in the southside of the city, and that’s how we got to know each other. We were both the masterminds of our bands and quickly started working together. I only realized later that being in a band back then was an experimental process that constantly changed. And this was how I gained experience throughout the ’80s – both theoretical as well as practical experience – which finally culminated in [how I approach] my true instrument, the personal computer. That’s what made it work. Hanna Bächer So, that was a way for you to find out what was possible, by collaborating with others. I mean, there are records you’ve produced on Trance Atlantic together with at least five or six others. Wolfgang Voigt Yes, indeed, it was a way of testing the waters, which was something I only realized later though. However, looking back on it, that’s what it feels like. That I did a lot of experimenting with all sorts of people, but that the rehearsal room as a laboratory, as an atelier, was enough for me to experiment. I was never the type who liked to practice and rehearse a lot, I wasn’t talented enough, or just lazy. Maybe I also become bored too quickly so I wanted to move on to new things all the time, instead of practicing the same crap over and over again with a band for six weeks. I guess it also had something to do with that. It was only in the late ’80s, when music machines became advanced enough and could support my kind of attitude towards music-making, that I finally found my way. These collaborations that you mentioned, which were also characteristic of later years in techno, when you produced music solely with machines, that was just a couple of guys hanging out in the rehearsal room, exchanging ideas and having fun with it. But that hasn’t really got anything to do with the conceptual work that I got into and was known for. Hanna Bächer Was it important to you to party a lot during that time? Was hedonism a motivation for your music? Wolfgang Voigt Absolutely. That was the driving force, without a doubt. What the football club was to others, the music club was to me, and especially the discourse. Of course you had to party and go out. In the ’80s I must have been to every punk and new wave concert that was happening, not just in Cologne, but also in Bonn and Düsseldorf. Ratinger Hof was as important as the Bouchelle in Cologne, and that was the case throughout the ’80s: You went to clubs, you went to bars and maintained the exchange about music. Clubbing hedonism was a natural part of that, with bands like ABC and so on. We got in contact with all of that and embraced that lifestyle on a full-time basis in total rejection of regular work, which was difficult to finance. Hanna Bächer How did it work back then, when you started out and when you started to create labels, long before there was Kompakt and Delirium, etc? What kind of infrastructure existed when you started to release your records? Wolfgang Voigt There wasn’t any. As most people will know, in the ’80s if you were young and didn’t have any money but you were enthusiastic and you just wanted to make music, you had to work with institutions that you couldn’t afford by yourself. You had to use very expensive studios and spend a lot of time there in order to produce what you originally intended. Therefore, you had to go through record company CEOs, who had to believe in you somewhat and who then told you what to do in the studio. That was the standard, back then. It was like that everywhere. In the late ’80s the acid and techno revolution basically swept away all of that sad ’80s music business overnight with the euphoria this kind of music brought with it. An important aspect of it was the so-called democratization of production tools. All of a sudden it was very easy, with simple machines and very little money, to produce your own music. Very early on, a wonderfully alternative, independent record market developed, similar to hip-hop, where you were able to distribute your music, despite limited funds, under the best free, wild and anarchic conditions, without having to rely on anybody, without record company CEOs, without having a big image. Leaving you free to express yourself through music. Those were the things that kick-started it. Hanna Bächer Your first ever label was Trance Atlantic, or was it Monotone? Wolfgang Voigt In the ’80s, my friend Jörg Burger and I wanted to interpret pop music in our own way and in the spirit of our role models, who mostly came from British pop music. We were huge fans of bands like ABC, Scritti Politti, Prefab Sprout… High-level music discourse inspired by British music was our thing until in ’88, acid house dropped from the sky, directly from Chicago. We were converted overnight, very much to the dismay of the people who had then already started to finance our lavish ’80s pop production, because we were simply not interested anymore. Then Jörg and I started our first few labels together, which had wonderfully fantastic names that seemed to fall from the sky, and we just got on with producing. After some teething problems, it quickly began to work out. We were right on track. Hanna Bächer I have to ask a very simple question, one of those that you normally don’t dare to ask as a journalist: Where did the Mike Ink moniker come from, under which you first released in ’91? Wolfgang Voigt I have no idea, it just came to me at night. I don’t know; it was fantasy. No, there were different reasons. It’s interesting when you come from the ’80s, when there was a lot of music discourse; where background, image and style were still very important, even though acid had already freed us from that. That didn’t mean that the average Spex reader in Germany was ready to accept that great music could also come from Castrop-Rauxel and not only from Detroit or London. So it was nice to just hide yourself behind certain pseudonyms. It had the advantage of fooling these people and saying, “Ha ha, it’s not from Chicago.” It was a sort of game. And the other thing was the aspect of not being committed, [because] you just didn’t know how long a project would last. The great thing about this kind of music was that you could do short term projects that could be over the next day. That was very liberating. It was only about the music, and if you came up with stupid ideas like calling yourself Mike Ink, the idea behind it would be forgotten in three weeks anyway, and then you just come up with something else. Eventually, it wasn’t really like that but those were the aspects that lead to this. It was also liberating and a bit cheeky. Hanna Bächer Was it also stylistically liberating to say, “I’ve got different monikers and I can create contrasts and produce a record that sounds completely different from the one last week?” Wolfgang Voigt In the early days of the straight bass drum it was very common to produce anonymous records, in some vinyl pressing plant that you would use at night, as a limited edition [release]. These were no-name records. This came about simply because some people couldn’t afford to print the actual label, which is why it had no name. The other reason was that these no-name records had two fascinating sides to them. One was, this is the official underground “license:” if it looks like that [a white label with no information], it has to be cool. And the other [outcome] was that people only chose [to buy] it because of the music. That is the most liberating thing that can happen to you as an artist. There is no prejudice, going for you or against you, dictating whether or not people are going to buy it because they don’t even know who you are. That means either the music speaks for itself or it doesn’t. What was great was that people went into the store, picked three plain records, listened to them and decided if they liked them or not. The end. It was great. Hanna Bächer But from your perspective as an artist, did you more or less create an artistic freedom, or was it more about the packaging when creating those labels? Wolfgang Voigt Absolutely. Like I said before, in the ’80s, everything was very long term and complicated, whereas I’m more of a fast-paced thinker and when creativity is released, it starts to shine. I’m also someone who is inspired by the fascinating, free times of the early ’90s, when there was a lot of freedom and everything seemed possible. It was a gold rush of creativity. You could do anything, from profane, crappy pop to conceptual minimalism. Someone like me was highly interested so I wanted to do all of this, and I did. That’s also why I created so many pseudonyms – to distinguish my different projects from one another. In comparison to other producers, my stuff had a very varied sound. Whereas many of them would make three records under the same name that sounded very similar, my releases were different in the sense that a lot of my ideas clearly contradicted each other but nonetheless needed to be put out there. Back then, I didn’t know that contradiction in itself or publicly displayed soul searching actually took place. I also made things for the moment, and the great thing about that was that I could immediately forget about it, and would go on to produce something completely opposite the next day. Truth was negotiable in those days. What was valid last week would be overthrown the next. I found this to be very positive. Hanna Bächer But, at the same time, you remained true to a certain quality of sound? Wolfgang Voigt Yes, by regularly screwing it up! Hanna Bächer Later, you mastered a lot of records, including for Kompakt. Where were you at in the early ’90s? Because you say you screwed it up, yet I listen to it and I say the quality is extremely high. Wolfgang Voigt Of course, I said this intentionally, to be provocative. I’m not a sound nerd and, even though I worked a lot with techno, I wasn’t interested in having in-depth knowledge when it came to technology. Even back then, there were a lot of people who were more than capable and did a better job than me. What you are probably thinking of is that a lot of the things I have done – because of the sources I used, and also because of intuitive research into difficult and abstract sound – have led to a very specific sound. People were excited about it but, objectively speaking, it was not music with a high-quality sound in a technical sense. That’s what I meant: There are a lot of things that are fascinating content-wise but that sound awful. Interestingly enough though, with a lot of projects, what is awful is simultaneously what’s good about it. That it is partially painful to listen to is what makes it special. This is something that I didn’t realize in the beginning, I just made music. It’s a reflection that you only get off of other people, which then helps you understand. Hanna Bächer I could imagine that one of the reasons why this still sounds up to date is because you worked with samples so much, which went on to develop in other musical directions in the following 20 or 30 years. Wolfgang Voigt Yes, but I wouldn’t say that the reason why it sounds up to date is the sampling that I used, because that also has to stand the test of time. It gives the whole thing a very genuine touch, something unique. I think it is well known by now that the guitar sample that I use is my sound. A lot of people in the techno scene define themselves through their analogue machines, whereas sampling is my trademark, my connection to pop history. It gives me the opportunity to connect to what I have lived through in pop music, express myself, integrate it into my music, reflect on it and question it in any way I like. Sampling also creates a fascinating sound that you yourself cannot produce, that is how simple it is. It can also lead to legal complications if you overdo it. The most interesting thing about sampling is that it has its own dynamic. Samples have movement within themselves. That’s how it is when you have a piece of music that moves, especially if it has rhythmic structures. To be able to combine that with your own elements leads to interesting abstractions and coincidences within the music that wouldn’t come about if you would only produce according to a master plan. This always inspired me to delve deeper into other dimensions. Hanna Bächer So coincidence played a big role? Wolfgang Voigt Coincidence is definitely one of my most loyal companions in music. I am, whether I want to be or not, a conceptual artist and I work like that. I can’t go in without an idea or plan, I don’t just do sessions and record them. However, the fact is that in the moment, the concept or plan you have becomes lost and that is when the magic happens. There is always a third element, which you don’t understand or can’t explain. On the basis that you know what you’re doing, then something is created. My way of working with samples has really helped with this. It has been inspirational. Hanna Bächer I would like to play a Studio 1 track now, called “Yellow.” Within those hugely conceptual works that you have created, is there any element of coincidence? Did an element of coincidence exist when you created Studio 1? Wolfgang Voigt At best, maybe some otherworldly inspiration. The Studio 1 project in particular was a very calculated, straightforward and transparent production, based on very clear mathematics. In that case, these elements that I just mentioned don’t have a place. This is also based on sampling but it is so microscopically small that the sample in itself is no longer important and the combination of everything simply becomes one. This creates a certain magic and concerning the choice of sound, this magic becomes negotiable. That is what happens between the lines. It was also just a moment of special inspiration that is uniquely connected to history. When this music was created in ’95, it was in the air and it touched certain people, myself included. From the feedback, you could see that you were on the right track. Simply because it was the sound of the time. Hanna Bächer This is Studio 1, “Yellow.” (music: Studio 1 – “Yellow”) Hanna Bächer That’s not entirely correct now, is it? It stays like that and changes. Wolfgang Voigt Yes, it stays like that and changes, exactly. It’s more or less an atypical example of what we’ve talked about before. What was fascinating with this one is, considering the time it was created, when minimalism became an international standard within the techno scene, there were certain styles that you would call artsy today, but back then I wouldn’t have looked at it in that way. Today, I have to accept that. I called it the art of omittance. You simply created a certain magic with minimal resources and minimal variation. And that is not easy to explain. To tell a story from nothing, over 16 minutes, but listening to it you think it’s only eight minutes, that’s what great minimalism is. Best case scenario, this almost loop-like music only tickles the human brain just enough so as to stay with it. That was the driving force behind it. And the only thing I couldn’t do without was the straight bass drum. The straight bass drum is non-negotiable; everything else is optional. Hanna Bächer Although I have to say, listening to some of your old works I was surprised how uneven the bass drum was at times. Wolfgang Voigt You only perceive it that way, because everything else around it is uneven. Hanna Bächer That’s correct. Wolfgang Voigt It’s deceiving, but it’s an illusion. Hanna Bächer Only illusion? Wolfgang Voigt That’s illusion. Without illusion, nothing works. Hanna Bächer I also wanted to play Studio 1, because it’s an early example of how you’ve worked with visual design, how you dealt with the packaging. Was there any interaction with the visual arts scene in Cologne during that time? Wolfgang Voigt I’m not sure if I remember exactly what happened in the visual arts scene in Cologne during that time. I remember that there wasn’t much going on and they all came to our clubs, to dance until they came up with ideas again. And I mean that in a positive way. There were always mutual reactions between the different art scenes in the whole region, not just Cologne. In a very positive way, there was connection and differentiation as well. I don’t know if anyone back then was painting Studio 1 music; I think I would have done it myself. What you are talking about is my liking for packaging. It stems from pop art, the Warhol influence, which I can’t get rid of. I was also always fascinated by conceptual work and expressing my concept through visual design – or at least complementing it, or explaining it by visual means. I was always like that. I always worked in an interdisciplinary way. In the late ’70s and ’80s I was as hyperactive as a visual artist as I was as a musician. Even though my musical activities took over in the ’90s, visual design was always part of me. Studio 1 is a very minimalistic, calculated music that works with very repetitive structures, within certain laws. However, this only works if you are able to forget that. Then it becomes soulful again. In the end, it’s disco. If it’s not sexy, it’s boring. It shouldn’t be purely academic. Yet it plays with a certain academic experience, in a light-hearted way. This finds its expression in visual design in various ways, which is something that I wanted to express as well. It added something more to it. We’ve just talked about the no-name records from the ’80s and ’90s and the reasons behind them. When Studio 1 came out in the mid-’90s, packaging and labelling with symbols and graphics were simply back in fashion. Once again, they were a means to explain and communicate the story and background. Especially in techno, which doesn’t explain anything and expresses itself nonverbally. There is no singer who explains the story to you. And everybody in the club is equal, as long as the DJ permits it. And that’s why visual designs made a comeback. That was also the case with Studio 1. Hanna Bächer Did you also have a visual idea that you eventually fulfilled with music, as with the early Gas material? Did you take the photographs before you created the music? Wolfgang Voigt No, not really. It wasn’t like the one thing came first and then the other. The Gas project was created around the same time as Studio 1. At the time, everything was circulating around a straight bass drum. That was the common denominator, which was non-negotiable, [but] otherwise there were no boundaries. It became clear that I wasn’t just this genuine techno producer that everyone thought of, but that I wanted to be pioneering and push all boundaries. With the Gas project, I wanted to produce a cosmos of more classical sound. Combining certain myths and ideas, [to communicate] a certain depth – even an expression of romantic German soul in correspondence with art history, [combined with] the idea of abstract and redundant techno elements. In those days, records were packaged and labelled. And since Gas had a very naturalistic sound, which mostly consisted of classical music elements, like strings and horns and such, it made sense to give it a warm and impressionistic visual design. So, it seemed only logical to use the photographs I had taken in the forest, to create the same intimate expression in a visual sense as well. Hanna Bächer I think we should listen to Zauberberg, our second track. Since I’m not sure which one of the records is the right one, I’ll play it from my computer. (music: Gas – “Zauberberg 2”) Wolfgang Voigt This piece is completely opposite to Studio 1, and consists of very long and quite melancholy, exhausting sounds, which are not easily explained with a few words. But it’s enough to give an impression. Hanna Bächer The audience can also research it for themselves. That was the second track from Zauberberg, if anyone wants to check it out. You said around the time of Studio 1 and Gas, packaging was back in play and you had about 20 or 50 different pseudonyms. When did you eventually start to perform on stage and come out of hiding as an artist? Wolfgang Voigt I’d say, when the time was right. In contrast to my friends and colleagues, I wasn’t exactly a stage person. I was never a DJ, even though I was surrounded by them. They never had to be concerned with me becoming a DJ. I was already doing a lot anyway. I am a devoted artist, music producer and conceptualist. I’m satisfied with working in the studio and producing a record that is eventually successful. That is my way of expressing myself and connecting with the world. Not so much on the stage. However, the Gas project in particular, which was well received internationally even outside the electro scene, seemed to be ideal for the stage, also because of the forest imagery. But I didn’t want that. Then the idea began to grow in my mind and I started to play around with it until I thought, “Hey why not?” It started to feel right. There was nothing strategic about it. It just evolved on its own. And of course as an artist you want to get the best response possible from your audience. The goal is to never disappoint your audience. So somehow I found a way to perform, even though I’m not a stage hog or stage diver; Gas is everything but stage diving. Hanna Bächer If you reflect on the Gas project, are you able to understand why it became your main project? Was that the plan from the very beginning? Wolfgang Voigt Even in those crazy times when I released and worked on a number of various projects, Gas seemed to evolve and stand out from all the other projects. There were two reasons for that, which I’ve come to understand by looking back on it, even though they were part of it from the beginning. Gas combined essential desires and artistic ambitions of mine that were always a part of me, even before I was a part of techno, [and] which basically poured out of me through techno. The more I played around with various techno styles, the more it evolved to become my core project. It just kind of happened. The feedback I received over the years, also from music journalists, was always very positive, but also very precise. To be praised is always nice, but it’s different when people really understand what you are doing. When they truly understand what your work is about, it is really motivating. This is still the case today. As an artist, I want to avoid being labelled, which is why I have been working at a fast pace: I am avoiding being stereotyped. I have many sides and I have found a way to avoid being put in just one box. It’s okay for me if a stereotype comes naturally and feels right. It just happened that the Gas project became timeless in a way that is beyond my influence. I have to accept that the project has become bigger than me. For me, the Gas project represents both arriving and never arriving. This is why, in that sense, I can let it happen and it is now the first time in 25 years that I am focusing on just this project as my main artistic venture: Celebrating it, developing it and creating a real connection with the audience through my musical expression. In this case, I succeeded in removing the malicious laws of time and transience. It then becomes acceptable for me to be put in a box. Nothing is worse than being put in a box. I could never play that game and I never wanted to. At the moment, I am capable of doing that because it just feels right. Hanna Bächer When you released Zauberberg in ’98, Kompakt became independent and, at the same time, you began working with pop more. Love Inc. came out in ’97, which included the famous Roxy Music samples. You then released Wassermann, etc, which was [stylistically] very much in contrast to Gas. How do you manage to concentrate? Wolfgang Voigt I don’t even start to imagine that I can concentrate. I have never really been able to and I never wanted to. Concentrating is very bad, that’s not how it works. You think you are brilliant but then you realize that you don’t know anything, and then it works. You have to study it all before, but once you are in the studio, you have to forget all about it. Concentrating is not for me. I’ll leave that to others, to the studio next door. How do I manage? It’s the zig-zagging against myself. There are many things I am interested in. My core business was the techno bass drum and permanently producing crazy combinations and ideas, even going as far as schlager music and folk music. Because I was interested in pushing boundaries, but not for the fun of it or to be provocative, but because I was simply inspired by the euphoria, which made it possible to cross the borders of musical genres. Back then, it was clear that the Gas project was in opposition to all the other projects you have mentioned. Today, looking at it from a distance, it becomes clear that it is all part of a whole. In the end, it all comes down to one artist, Wolfgang Voigt. Hanna Bächer I need to check if I have the right side, sorry. [looks at record] Wolfgang Voigt Don’t ask me for the right side! Hanna Bächer Hopefully this should be Wassermann, “Fackeln im Sturm,” and hopefully on 45”. We are a bit experimental here. Wolfgang Voigt A good example of great sound. (music: Wassermann – “Fackeln im Sturm”) So much for great sound! Hanna Bächer Maybe it’s because of the 12-sided building! Wolfgang Voigt That actually works well. Hanna Bächer Yeah, you think so? Wolfgang Voigt If you know what the material is made of, you can’t say it sounds great. But it’s certainly original. Today, we have better versions of it that sound good. Hanna Bächer What are they made of? Wolfgang Voigt It’s still made from the same source. It is Juliane Werding, “Am Tag als Conny Kramer starb.” That was my attempt at saving schlager music. I don’t know if it worked. The whole piece consists of a straight bass drum and all the other ingredients are taken from Werding’s song. Taken from a very bad Arkade record that I once found in my father’s home bar. That’s why it sounds so great. With a real production you would do it differently. If that would be Das Boot, for example. [The bad quality] didn’t interest me, I was interested in the subject. I was interested in it and also wasn’t making fun of it, which luckily back then was understood, because schlager and [German] folk music are a red flag for people. On the contrary, I think it’s a great piece. It doesn’t hold great meaning for me, it’s also not an homage to Werding, but I liked it, even as a child, I thought it was impressive. My approach was more of an academic one. Can I transfer this into another serious context, by converting it, by integrating it into danceable techno, so that you could take it seriously? In the sense that, it has worked if nobody’s laughing anymore. That’s how you have to imagine my process. It worked extremely well with that piece, simply because the production quality was already so bad. That alone stopped the laughter. It’s simply an attempt to experiment with a contaminated music field, which always interested me. I am fascinated by schlager music because of how it uses the German language. At the same time, I know what is problematic about it, and that it has no place in pop subculture. I was interested in publicly questioning that. Or, at least to make a suggestion of how it could work. This was always on my mind, since the days of the Neue Deutsch Welle. Another way to work with the German language in pop culture. This embodies an example of that. The same goes for brass music. Hanna Bächer Polka, for example. Shall we just listen to polka now, just for fun? I have to play it from a record though. Wolfgang Voigt Polka is always good. Hanna Bächer Maybe we should mention that the polka tracks that you released in 2013 or ’14, differ from the ones you released in the ’90s on Warp. Wolfgang Voigt Exactly, I released a record on the British label Warp, whereas at the time I was doing a lot of work with two-quarter beats, but that’s completely different. What I made in 2015 still carries the title polka, and it actually sounds like polka. Undeniably. (music: Wolfgang Voigt – “Polkatrax 1.1”) Yet again in this case, just like before when I was interested in two-quarter beats, which [are also used in] reggae and dub or ska; brass always moved me. Polka, brass and folk music interest me. At the same time, I’m aware of the difficulties of selling it to my people. That is why I’m trying to reduce it to its very essence, to its unique crunch-point. Reducing it to an essential loop, trying to get rid of what is potentially difficult, or where it becomes ironic. It’s an academic approach, it’s a science, it’s a proposal and an attempt to see if it works. With this record though, it’s impossible to get rid of the smile on people’s faces. Didn’t work. There are other examples too. Hanna Bächer I’m very interested in what you just said. This attempt to produce something you can take seriously that is usually considered to be silly, or that is generally blunt entertainment. Wolfgang Voigt It is quite simple. There is a ton of awful stuff out there, where the bass drum is being mixed with schlager music, everybody knows that. So far, so funny, but that never interested me. I was always interested in the pure rhythmic structure. That was more a scientific interest, combined with a feeling of ease. I’m even touched by music from Roy Black or Die Egerländer. At the same time I’m aware of how difficult it is to communicate that, because it’s highly contaminated. It’s the wrong kind of music. It’s grandfather’s music, as people would say, and it’s true. What always fascinated me was, how much can I convert these things, confront people and ask new questions, and produce serious pop music [within the] subculture, without anyone laughing, without any irony? It has nothing to do with irony. I’m serious about it, although of course I accept it when people don’t understand that. This stuff is already established as what it is within the context of music and of course you can’t just get this out of your head. I’m also interested to see if it’s possible to reverse that and reduce it to its very essence and look at it without prejudice. To produce a kind of music from it that you actually would like to listen to. Not because you think it’s funny, or it’s interesting, but because you really enjoy it. Hanna Bächer For all other aspects of your work, not just the music, but the labels and packaging or your well known Kompakt or Speicher logo with the eagle, would you allow irony? Or would you say that it has an aspect of irony in it? Wolfgang Voigt These things carry a certain irony, which is unavoidable. And naturally you can recognize my humorous nature in it. You can’t make a cover [incomprehensible] without anyone laughing. That would be absurd. But my intention is to ask questions and challenge the perception. I’m experimenting and fantasizing a lot, to eventually see if it could work, even though I know it could fail. That’s what I’m interested in. And in many cases it was very successful. There are examples of hits that were played successfully and seriously in clubs, not just as silly gags. What I found to be interesting was that techno DJs included some of these tracks in their sets and had great success with them, without anybody laughing. I am not Schlagermove [music festival], that is not my business. I don’t have anything against that. I also like to laugh, but my intentions are different. Concerning the packaging. If you use the old coat-of-arms of Cologne as your label logo, of course people are going to laugh. Especially when you have a bit of a city battle going on within the German techno scene, to encourage a little competition. The scene in Berlin can’t laugh about it, but the scene in Cologne can, which is part of the fun. But I wouldn’t put it down as silly irony. I think the eagle is beautiful and it’s also part of our identity. But I also always said that the eagle and the way we use him on our labels, in a series of various colours, pays homage to Warhol’s Marilyn. It’s packaging, but also pop art. It’s a mixture of all these things, but it’s certainly not meant as a silly joke, that alone doesn’t make ends meet. Hanna Bächer When you mention serial productions, one of your most famous ones was Kreisel in ’99. Wolfgang Voigt That wasn’t a serial production, that was a suicide attempt! Hanna Bächer The 52 7”s. That was almost the answer to my question already, because after that you took a bit of a hiatus, was that because of Kreisel? Wolfgang Voigt Kreisel was a deliberate attempt to go too far, so to speak. Serial production had played a big role in my works, but was also internationally established in the techno scene. I was hardly the inventor of serial production. I took it further than anyone else in Cologne, that much is true, but all these labels out there were based on serial production. You only expressed yourself through serial numbers in the ’90s. You didn’t say, “Do you have the new track from so-and-so?” You said, “Do you have xyz 32,” and after that came number 33. That was taken to extremes, until you couldn’t go any further. For me personally, Kreisel in ’99 was an excessive showdown, by producing a kind of best of, every week, which was a suicide mission. It still worked out really well, and to this day is a worthy collection for enthusiasts. It was also a countdown for the year 2000, created in a bit of a hysterical atmosphere, and I was just tempted to push my limits. Hanna Bächer In the ten years that followed, when you hardly put out any releases, what role did Kompakt play in keeping you busy? Wolfgang Voigt Kompakt played the exact same role that music had played all these years before. I called it the art of company making. I had overwhelmed the scene in the ’90s with a flood of releases and I thought it was time to take a break. I had said everything I wanted to say. In the meantime, our company, that we renamed Kompakt in ’98, had developed a fantastic self-marketing structure. We had finally become a professional, serious company. On top of that, we received wonderful demo tapes from all around the world, and a lot of them fitted right in with us. So, for many years I was basically very busy working as an A&R manager and establishing the company, together with my long-standing partner Michael Mayer. This was the basis of our artistic freedom. It was also perfect timing to basically retire, after I had finished Kreisel and then hardly produced anything. In the following eight years I put out as many releases as I had in just the eight weeks before. Those were artistic intervals that I had to follow. I can’t just produce music for the sake of it, there has to be some inspiration and a reason. I was just at a point where I needed to do something else. I was able to channel my creativity into establishing the company, which I had called the art of company making. To me, this was also some kind of art. It involved the same creative energy that had driven me before. I didn’t become a business man overnight. I was never a business man and will never be one. Hanna Bächer You live in very close proximity to your company, basically in the same building, where other business partners and employees are living as well. I had asked you before about distraction. When you started to produce music again, how was it possible for you to concentrate on your work, being in such close proximity to the company? Wolfgang Voigt Simply by avoiding the distractions. For about eight years I worked in the company, mostly in cooperation with Michael Mayer but also others, and we had over 300 releases in that time. Michael with his experience as a DJ and me with my experience as a producer, we’ve accomplished a lot together. Sometime around 2008, my inspiration to produce music came back and I just had to follow my instinct and start making music again. And I had to address creative questions that had accumulated over the years. That led to me leaving my job and handing it over to others, because when I work creatively I need to have my own space and time to focus entirely on my work. I’m not the type who is involved in the day-to-day business of the company, at the same time as producing music. That is counterproductive. I consider myself lucky to have such great colleagues who can do the job and have my back and who would be annoyed if I would stick my nose into things. So, it works out quite perfectly, in the sense that I can be in the background and have my freedom, which is made possible by the company. That is why we set it up like that. Hanna Bächer Are the records you made after 2008 – I wanted to play some tracks from Kafka for example – less contradictory than the ones in the ’90s? Wolfgang Voigt They are closer together, forming an overall picture. That’s simply because the ’90s were different from the ’00s. Times had changed. After an eight-year hiatus, I couldn’t just go back to where I had left things off. Things had changed massively and also other, more mature aspects of my creativity had made their way to the surface. Before I knew what was happening, I was going in a more artistic direction, which you could have called ambient in the ’90s with Gas, but what was now more in the direction of Ligeti and Stockhausen. My conceptual minimalist music, which you’ve already mentioned with Kafka, became even more conceptually stringent. This obliged me even more to [consider] club music and the straight bass drum, and forced me to confront myself through purely artistic and literary aspects, which were more closely connected to high-culture. What was interesting to me was that through this process I could set my innermost creativity free. [When considering] my releases from earlier years, for example on my label Protest, which I managed [and] where all of my controversial and bold ideas had found a home, I felt that all the promises that I had made in the ’90s had now come true. Of course, the audience perceives it differently. That’s my subjective view. Ultimately it is based on even greater artistic freedom. Hanna Bächer Let’s listen to “Kafkatrax 1.1.” (music: Wolfgang Voigt – “Kafkatrax 1.1”) There is this consistent delay throughout the Kafkatrax. Wolfgang Voigt That is all conceptual. Besides the straight bass drum, it all consists of vocals taken from a [Franz] Kafka audiobook. That creates a kind of claustrophobic atmosphere with abstract voices. We haven’t heard the most representative part of it, where it starts to climax into an abstract babel of voices, where you think you might or might not recognize words. The concept was to create the whole thing out of that and only a bass drum. That has something to do with, what I like to call “artificial scarcity,” by only using very few parts to create something whole. It creates a very dense aesthetic, which opens up certain space but is closed within itself. What happens here is twofold: The concept of only using human voices and, if you delve deeper into it, this feeling of a certain claustrophobic atmosphere, which some would call Kafka-esque. This is how you would generally describe this ambiance. Interestingly enough, this effect has nothing to do with the fact that I used a Kafka audiobook. It could have been any other audiobook. It could also have been Hansel and Gretel and you would have had the same effect. I find this very interesting, it’s conceptual music but it takes on a life of its own and ideally you forget about it and enjoy it as a techno track. Hanna Bächer In the meantime, how important is it to you, to be able to play instruments? Has that changed over the years? Because your attitude was more punk. Wolfgang Voigt It’s not important to me, because I can’t play any instruments. Hanna Bächer I meant more technical instruments. Wolfgang Voigt No, of course I have gained some knowledge. I just don’t want to define myself through technical or musical knowhow. That would be a false claim on my part, even though I have a good, intuitive skill. I know what A minor is and I know how machines work, but it’s just a means to an end. I wouldn’t want to make that a subject. The result is what is important. Of course it’s all part of it, but over the years, I’ve always come back to what has always been my method and instrument: One man and one sampler and a certain way of using clusters on a piano. My instrument is the piano. I express myself by using the piano in an abstract way, without being able to actually master it. It’s my means of expression. I can use a brush and canvas and express myself, without knowing how to paint. In that way, I’m an autodidact. But it would be wrong to say I have no training in these matters. Obviously. Hanna Bächer You definitely have the background knowledge, but I find it interesting in comparison to other electronic musicians, who seem to start doubting themselves at some point and need to collaborate with an orchestra to legitimize themselves. Wolfgang Voigt I don’t know if that stems from doubt. Basically I think as an artist you are destined to be in doubt, [and] especially doubting yourself. All my work is based on doubt, questioning and contradictions. Everything we have listened to is orientation, controversy and questions. Usually you go in with your profound musical knowledge and ideally at the end you have to realize it’s all wrong. There is no absolute truth. Therefore doubt plays a very important part in finding yourself as an artist. I wouldn’t want to prescribe it, but some people out there could use a bit of doubt here and there. Hanna Bächer I would like to play something you’ve made: Wendy Gondeln AKA Albert Oehlen – “Fracking with Wolfgang.” (music: Wendy Gondeln – “Fracking with Wolfgang”) It’s a project that really pushes the boundaries. It is definitely art. And it also stands for a certain freedom. What is this? Wolfgang Voigt It’s a collaboration with the painter Albert Oehlen. We share a mutual fascination with each other, and Albert also has a liking for music and expresses himself through the violin. He’s looking for a musical, artistic exchange, which we have cultivated between us, by placing his violin sounds over my straight bass drum. This creates very unique and free moments that open up all kinds of new spaces, which not everyone is keen on entering. Hanna Bächer The record was released on Magazine, another Cologne label. With many of your most famous records, you’ve basically given them away to other labels to release. I think that symbolizes a certain generosity with your work, where you say, “OK, I can produce elsewhere.” Wolfgang Voigt Art has to be generous. It’s nice of you to mention that. You asked about being in a band, about connections and producing techno music together. A very established form of producing music in the techno scene, is the so-called remix, the exchange of music. And part of that is to produce pieces on other labels that you like and support, and that was the case with Magazine. It’s a great Cologne label, I like them and it was fun. I wouldn’t call it a gift, it’s done out of respect for each other. That’s kind of a tradition in techno, because how do you think band spirit works in techno? Definitely not with eight guys standing around one sampler, it doesn’t work. It’s a different way of exchanging ideas. I’ve made a lot of music with friends, for example with my friend Jörg Burger, who basically sits next door to me. We exchange data and elements of music, as in I make something, he adds something to it, and so on. These are all well-established ways of co-operation. Of course you also sit together in the studio with your best friends and work on stuff, but that’s a social element that you usually don’t have in techno. In all fairness, it’s more of a one-man show. That’s how it is with techno. Hanna Bächer How does it work with visual arts? There are more and more records where you’ve created the labels. Is there an exchange or communication going on with other visual artists? Wolfgang Voigt I don’t draw or paint. I did it once, but a very long time ago. I was always fascinated with visual arts, which comes through in how I wrap up my music. Hanna Bächer That’s what I meant, the cover design. Wolfgang Voigt If you take the bananas that Warhol put on the Velvet Underground records. I put those on there myself. Whether I like it or not, I am an interdisciplinary conceptual artist. What I had discovered later, when I had dug even deeper into certain ideas, was that the visual design helped me to get out even more from certain concepts. All of a sudden, when I was working with loops or abstract modulations of sound sculptures, concerning myself with the visual aspect of it helped me to advance and find better solutions. I’m not interested in distinguishing between the arts and music, and I don’t respect these boundaries. But I’m not with Beuys when he says, “Everybody is an artist.” I don’t believe in that. I also don’t think everyone should pursue being an artist or is capable of that. That’s how I see it. I understand the complexity of interdisciplinary art and I also know of examples where people achieve great results by combining the arts and music. I would put myself in that group. Although, I’m certainly not just reducing myself to visual design now. And I’m not a painter. It is conceptual digital art. After all, my brush is the computer. Hanna Bächer As with Zukunft ohne Menschen for example. I would like to play another piece, from Rückverzauberung to demonstrate another approach to what I believe Gas had already been preoccupied with; another way of working with classical samples. I would also like to start the Q&A, so if you have any questions, keep them in mind. (music: Wolfgang Voigt – Track from Rückverzauberung) Wolfgang Voigt Beautiful. [applause] Just decided spontaneously to play it in full. Hanna Bächer Such a different way to work with a climax than in Studio 1. Completely [different]. Wolfgang Voigt In short, Rückverzauberung is a project that I was working on over the last ten years, before I started working on Gas again. It was a time when I realized that I had delved into other, deeper musical spheres. I was more concerned with aspects of 12-tone music and abstract music, more in the direction of Ligeti, Schönberg and Stockhausen and others, which was very well received by the audience. It was also released by Magazine, who had the courage to publish it. It was definitely a risk, because you never know if the audience will accept it. Looking back on my whole career, I’m really thankful and can consider myself lucky, that my audience was loyal and kept an open mind. To follow me in directions where you could easily say, “I don’t get it. It has nothing to do with Studio 1 anymore,” or, where you could think, “He’s going places where he doesn’t belong.” Fortunately, even the guardians of classical music have understood that opening borders between genres can be mutually beneficial and create new worlds. It’s a subject I’ve been working on and which can be tricky and you also need the courage to do that. I’m happy that it’s been working for me all these years, and that I get a pass. Hanna Bächer Maybe as a last question, before we start the Q&A, concerning Rückverzauberung 6, could you elaborate on what you just mentioned about Ligeti and atonality, and how that interacts with your work? Wolfgang Voigt First of all, it has something to do with how I perceive music. I like to perceive music as a bit lopsided. It’s opening new worlds to me. I’m very interested in music clusters, because they challenge certain harmonic laws and it goes in a different direction than what I’ve been exposed to before. Nothing against harmonic music or melody, but I think it’s fascinating to try to retrieve a melody by putting it through very deep and scrutinising sound channels. Atonality, cluster music, 12-tone music, is unbearable for most people. For me that’s where it starts to get interesting. It was always like that, even when I was listening to Roy Black. I was interested in these things at the same time. And eventually I’m confronted by these things again and again, the longer my career goes on, and they make a comeback. I’m very intuitive in that way and I like to delve deep. I then just have to be bold enough to go so far as to release it. Hanna Bächer Before we start the Q&A, I would like to thank you very much, Wolfgang. [applause] Wolfgang Voigt I think we’ve earned ourselves a beer [applause] Hanna Bächer Thank you, Wolfgang. Audience Member I have a question about Narkopop, your last album. You already have experience with sound design. Did you already have the complete sound in your head or was it more experimental? Wolfgang Voigt I always know precisely what I want to do before I go in the studio, but it only works when I forget all of that. The one you’re asking about, Gas, is one of the soundest projects of mine, where everything is set out and all the ingredients are known. The challenge is to forget all that in order to be able to free the sound once again, to not strictly stay within the concept, but not to get off track. Gas is a big commitment that I don’t want to jeopardize. I come in with certain ideas to find what I’m looking for, but the crucial moment arises when you eventually close your eyes and ears, and step into a magical realm. Without it, it’s simply not possible. It’s hard to explain. What is essential with great art is what you can’t explain. That’s intuitive. And if that doesn’t happen, it’s not going to work. Audience Member OK, thanks. I have a second question. I’ve seen you perform live in Bonn, but one couldn’t really tell what you were doing exactly. How do you perform or prepare for performances? Do you also use the computer live or do you simply arrange it? Wolfgang Voigt First of all, when I perform, I’m standing in front of my computer in an artificial forest with people surrounding me sitting in the dark. That’s how I would describe it. I’ve said that my method is the piano and modulating sound clusters. All that is based on a set concept, to use as few resources possible, to modulate and sculpt the sound very carefully in order to try and reach the audience. The Gas concert is so fragile that it is paramount to keep things together, to open up new spheres very carefully and to be able to communicate. Eventually, it comes down to less is more. The spirit is there and has to be transported. It has to fill the space. That’s what’s complex about it. Audience Member OK, thanks. Wolfgang Voigt You’re welcome. Audience Member I wanted to ask you what it means to you when you say, “A track is working.” Wolfgang Voigt What does it mean, if the track works or how it works? Audience Member How a track works in a club, as you’ve mentioned earlier, when you said, “I realized that it worked.” I want to know how you define whether a track works or not? Wolfgang Voigt It has to move me and catch me. Ideally, the track surprises me or at least confirms something that I already knew existed. The question is, if you mean my music or stuff from other artists? Audience Member In particular, your tracks. Wolfgang Voigt My own, well… Audience Member As in, when you mentioned the feedback from the audience, that it works for you and you can say, “That’s feedback I can live with and use to refine my work.” Wolfgang Voigt For the part of my music that has established itself in clubs, because it is dance music, which is communicated to the audience by DJs, it simply comes down to whether or not sparks are flying. This type of music consists of aspects, like pure danceability and funkiness and subtle bass, and you can see if it has an effect on the dancefloor or not. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. It has to work in specific contexts. In clubs it is mostly the track before and the track after. I get my validation when I think the audience has understood what I wanted to achieve. I can’t explain it differently. Audience Member Thanks. Wolfgang Voigt You’re welcome. Hanna Bächer We have to be out of here by 10, so I think this is the last question, over here. Audience Member Thank you for an interesting talk. It was fascinating to listen to you. I especially remember three words: Schlager, folk music and contamination. It reminded me of a statement by Ralf Hütter, when he said his intention with Kraftwerk was to create a new German folk music because most of what was considered German music was contaminated and burned, and that he wanted to try and start from scratch. I think what you are trying to do with Kompakt is basically on the same level. Is that the case? Wolfgang Voigt I know the quote by Ralf Hütter and I understand it and I like the idea. There is indeed a correlation to what we do. I just explained that I like to intertwine all these musical genres in a very scientific way but also in a very soulful way. I want to reintegrate all that and create something new. We’ve mostly spoken about my music tonight, although this is not what we are releasing with Kompakt, but mostly music from other artists. What we are trying to create with Kompakt is definitely part of that idea and what we are experiencing with all these young artists. So, in the end we have made an impact and had success, even internationally, especially since we integrated various music genres into a techno label, in opposition to other techno labels that went in a different direction politically. Our credo was always: 51% has to have a straight bass drum, the rest is negotiable. That was a bold step but it was recognized across the board that it developed the music further and opened up our genre. Looking back, I think it has been a great success. Audience Member I would have to agree. Wolfgang Voigt Great. Wolfgang Voigt Many thanks. Let’s have a beer. [applause]

Robert Henke
If Robert Henke never made a single record, he would still be one of the most significant figures in electronic music. Along with co-founder and one-time collaborator Gerhard Behles, Henke developed the earliest version of Ableton Live, the digital audio workstation and audio sequencer that, among other things, allows musicians to store and trigger samples during shows. Henke has also recorded several innovative electronic albums. On the Gravity LP, recorded under the name Monolake, he mined the intersection between abstract computer music and dance-derived techno while on Floating Points, released under his own name, he used digital noise to reconstruct the ambient sounds of our natural world. A consummate thinker who exists outside of all mainstream conversations, Henke has most recently been experimenting with lasers to craft mesmerizing audiovisual installations.
In his lecture at the 2018 Red Bull Music Academy in Berlin, Robert Henke sat down to discuss the importance of limits, working with lasers and the history of Ableton Live.
Hosted by Christine Kakaire I wanna give you all a warm welcome to the very first lecture of term one of Red Bull Music Academy 2018. It’s the 20th anniversary of RBMA and we’re back in Berlin where it all started, and we’re here at the Funkhaus, a really incredible and inspirational space. Speaking of incredible and inspirational, [laughs] our very first guest is someone to whom the word genius is often applied. Robert Henke Eh… really? Christine Kakaire Yeah, truly. Robert Henke That scares me. [laughs] We can talk about the genius concept later. Christine Kakaire Ok, well, we’ll put a pin in that. I’m really, really happy to welcome Robert Henke. Robert Henke Hello. [applause] Christine Kakaire So while I was preparing for this talk, there’s a lot of ground to cover in terms of the length and breadth of your career and your art and your innovation, so I’m hoping that we can scratch the surface of this by asking a lot of ‘why’ questions as opposed to a lot of ‘how’ questions. But I wanted to start with a piece of music which is not made by you, and I believe that you were seven or eight when it first came out, and I believe it had a particular impact on you. And it’s gonna be one of the tracks from Jean-Michel Jarre’s Oxygène album. So let’s have a listen and then we can talk about this album and its impact on you. Robert Henke Do we need to listen to all of that? Christine Kakaire Not all of it, not all of it, we’re just gonna listen to a little excerpt. Robert Henke Ok. [laughs] (music: Jean-Michel Jarre – “Oxygène Part II”) Christine Kakaire So that was “Oxygène Part II” by Jean-Michel Jarre. I could feel you squirming [laughs] as it was being played. Robert Henke Yeah, it’s probably gonna be more painful when we start listening to my own stuff. But as an interesting historical side note, Jean-Michel Jarre, as far as I know, played all of this by hand. He doesn’t like sequencers, so he has a drum computer, and all these repetitive sequences is really him doing this by hand intentionally because he likes the groove of it. And this was recorded without any computer help on a multi-track recorder. So, besides the cheesiness that is very obvious and becomes more obvious the more you listen to the whole album, the achievement technically is quite impressive. So, as far as the sound design is concerned, this keeps up well. As far as the composition is concerned, there’s a lot of ‘80s stuff which sounds amazing before it becomes the main part and afterwards. Christine Kakaire So it’s all intros and outros. Robert Henke Yeah, you can probably create amazing mix CDs with just intros and outros of all these pieces. Christine Kakaire But I’d love to know what was it that was… That kind of gripped you when you were listening to this for the first time as a youngster? Robert Henke Well, the… To get an idea of the impact this had was… We talk about someone who grew up in a family of engineers with no artistic interest whatsoever and also no musical interest whatsoever. So there was no culture of listening to music in my upbringing and electronic music was nonexistenting. So the only music I had access to was pretty much the rock music my parents did listen to on the radio and a bit of stuff that I did listen on the radio, which was pretty similar to, well, normal mainstream rock, pop of this time. And I listened to this album at a friend’s place of my parents who had a fantastic stereo system, and whilst my parents were there, this album was basically playing there from vinyl, and I still remember the loudspeakers, because I was literally standing in front of the loudspeakers and was stunned because there was no vocals, there was no… there was just this endless development, endless development of sound going on. And the friend of my parents noticed that this did something to me and he promised to record a tape, and that’s what he did. So I had this tape with two albums from Jean-Michel Jarre at home, and I would assume I’ve been listening to this tape several hundred or thousand times. So that had quite some impact, and afterwards I started trying to figure out, pre-internet and living at the outskirts of a boring city, how to access such music and how to find more of that. Christine Kakaire And what were your first steps to get access to this music and also to try to tease apart how it was made or how it could be replicated in a sense? Robert Henke Well, I went to a mainstream music store and found a completely confused salesperson who nevertheless tried to find something for me and at some point he pointed me to Tangerine Dream, which turned out to be equally important at this time to me and, well, the rest was simple. I read a lot, so I knew what a synthesizer was, and I knew what a drum computer was, and then I went to a local music store and annoyed them because I had no money but I wanted to try everything. And when I was a bit older, I started to earn my money by carrying out newspapers and stuff like this, and bought my first synthesizer and from there it was no turning back, and I played in a band, kind of electronic rock, really horrible, and I’m incredibly thankful for the fact that it was pre-internet. Years ago I found a tape recording we made, and I am really, really happy that this is the only recording. [laughs] Christine Kakaire I believe that first synthesizer of yours was a Juno-6. What world did that open up for you? Where did it take you musically? Robert Henke Well, so, I had a synthesizer and I had a Walkman and I had a tape deck which could record, and I built myself a cheap mixing console, console is a nice word, a bunch of wires and transistors. And so I was recording on my tape deck and then I was taking the tape out of the tape deck, put it in my Walkman, played it back. It was slightly out of tune because the speed was different. Then I played on top of it, and then I did this again and again. After four generations it was just noise with some music in the background. But these were my first experiments into doing something by myself. And yeah, and then playing in the band. And this was pretty much what I did until I left school and finally were able to earn more money, so I was able to buy an Atari and a reverb and started to build something like a small home studio. And then I moved to Berlin, and that changed everything. Christine Kakaire Actually I think at this point we can put up a photo, I believe it’s from 1993, it’s photo number six. There we go. Robert Henke Ah, ah. Christine Kakaire That is a young Robert Henke with a pretty sick mohawk standing on a rooftop in 1993. And I was really drawn to this image on your website, it kind of reminded me of this photography anthology called Berlin Wonderland which came out a few years ago, which is, for anyone that’s not aware, it’s a collection of black and white photos taken in and around Berlin in the first five years or so of the 90s. And they were all almost surreal images, really desolate backgrounds, but all focused on one kind of quirky character in the middle. And I think this really fit into that aesthetic. So it’d be great to hear from you what Berlin was actually like at that time, if it was as wild and limitless as it seems to be. Robert Henke Well I mean this could of course be the beginning of a talk for the next few months. So, for me personally Berlin put two things together which turned out to be equally important. The one thing was that I started to study computer science, and I was also connected to the electronic studio of the technical university, which was a place of very academic computer music research. Research into sound generation, exposure to serious composers of electronic and electroacoustic music, which was, again, something which I had no clue about before, so I heard [Iannis] Xenakis, I heard François Baille, [Bernard] Parmegiani, [Karlheinz] Stockhausen, all these people I had no idea about. And at the same time Berlin to me was going to Tresor and being profoundly shocked the first night, because it was just so much more than I could handle. And I left after half an hour and I thought I will never come back. And guess what, the next day I was back. So these two very, very different forces, the refinement and the code, and waiting one night to calculate the five seconds of sound versus insanely loud bass drum, high-hat, snare, and lots of fog and strobe and half-naked people dancing. This was something which basically shaped my whole experience. And the situation in Berlin which made all this possible was, to condense this in a really brief history, in East Germany there was no private property, so everything was state owned. A lot of buildings in East Berlin, including a lot of small factories and manufacturing spaces were state owned. So the DDR disappeared, the system vanished, and there was still no owner. And the previous owners were either people who had to leave Germany to flee from the Nazi regime or they were killed. So there were basically buildings where the ownership was not clear. And that meant that it was possible for artists to more or less just go in there. And the city government at some point made a very important decision to say, “OK, we have the choice, either these buildings are vandalized and empty, or these people rent out for nothing basically to artists. We don’t know exactly what they’re doing in there, but at least they keep their windows shut and the heating intact.” So it was possible to find the most amazing industrial spaces, spaces which are similar to what you have here, on a small scale, but very similar in terms of interior, in terms of architecture, in terms of accessibility, right in the center of the city, and do something. All you had to do is go to the city government and say, “I’m an art student, I want to make an art project in there.” And opening a bar meant putting a few boxes of beer, a small PA and a turntable in it, and that’s it. And since electronic music culture was not established as a commercial culture, no one even thought of what’s with the money they earn there, you know, no one cared. And that meant zero investment, and that meant it was possible to do all kinds of strange experiments. It didn’t matter if two people showed up for a concert because there were no costs involved. So you just met with your friends and you played some music, and some more friends came by, then some more friends, and at some point you decided, OK, maybe we need a door and we need to have a better coffee machine, and next time we bring more beer. But that was it. And this situation allowed for two things. It allowed for musical experiments and it also allowed for a social experiment, like how can you interact with people, what is a club as a social experience, but also very important, an audiovisual experience and a spatial experience. If you come in an empty space, you have to make a decision, where do I put my loudspeakers, where do I put the bar, where is the DJ or the live performer, where is the audience? And this led to all these nice situations of the DJ playing right in the middle of the audience, doing quadraphonic sound just to try it out, having bass bins two stories below and enjoy the fact that the bass is rumbling through the whole building before it reaches the dancefloor, all kinds of crazy shit you could just do. And this vibe made it possible to be very naïve in a very good sense. And it didn’t matter what you tried out musically as long as someone liked it. You could try the most bizarre things. And if you listen to early techno, it’s so obvious that people just threw together whatever they had in mind. It was much more eclectic than what came out ten years later when everything became more formalized and there was already a recipe. There was no recipe at the beginning, if you listen to early KLF, or if you listen to many, many other records of that time. Someone started with a shouting sample in a track, someone else copied it and added something else, including of course horrible scenarios where there was this kind of commercial thing with barking dog voices pitched up and down. But everything was possible. And I don’t know where we started, but that’s how it was. Christine Kakaire I’m curious, do you believe that now that things have changed in terms of the city, perhaps in terms of the commercialization of certain types of formerly underground types of music, do you believe it is at all possible for young people coming up now to be able to replicate those conditions somehow, of being boundless and being unrestricted, or do you believe that that’s been lost? Robert Henke This is a difficult question to ask someone who is approaching 50, because I feel I’m not an expert in talking about what 20-year-old people should do or what they even are doing, because I know too little. But I believe there is always a way to find a creative niche, because there always was, and there is in every society and in every culture, even in the most oppressive ones, there’s always ways around the official doctrine, and I experienced two things. As far as the electronic dance music culture is concerned, obviously this type of music and this type of expression is still of interest to people in their early ‘20s, because when I perform I see people in this age who are invested and who are performing right after or before me, and I don’t feel that I don’t belong there or that there’s a huge cultural or age gap, which is super nice. But of course there’s also a lot of different ways to express yourself these days. So in a way, the internet made it possible to collaborate and exchange yourself with people all over the globe. So instead of having regional boundaries… So back in the 90s, you had regional pockets, so the Berlin scene and the Cologne scene and the Detroit scene. They were all centered around, OK, this is a regional space with all these people in here, and everyone here shares the same idea. And there’s another regional space somewhere else which shares a different idea which might be connected or not. And now you have this global onion ring scenario where all over the world you have people interested in the same electronic music, and they’re only a few people but they’re connected to a few others all around the globe. And we’re orbiting around this globe. And sometimes this is even actually strange that you go somewhere to a completely different cultural background and you go to a party and you listen to exactly the same tracks you listen to in Berlin. And sometimes I almost wish that, I go, just making something up, I go to an amoeba and experience a completely different type of electronic music at the places where I have access to. I say the last sentence because, who knows, perhaps there is something going on which is just not in my onion ring, and therefore it’s happening right below or above me and I have no clue. So as far as I know there is a lot of interesting things going on, and it’s probably wrong to look at exactly a specific type of electronic dance music for innovation, because if the music ends up in a shoe store for selling expensive shoes, you know that it can’t be underground anymore in the same way it was 25 years ago. But I assume there’s different scenes, there’s different things going on which might just emerge right now, and which might not even be connected to purely listening to music. I’m only very vaguely familiar with for instance what’s going on in game engine development and what people do with game engines these days. Who knows what comes up as great art forms using game engines in a few years, where people do the most amazing virtual reality experiences that of course include electronic music. So who knows what’s happening. Christine Kakaire I mean you seem to be somebody who is always… There’s always a sense of forward momentum in what you’re doing, going from studying computer music, making music, using hardware instruments, creating software to be able to revolutionize the way that you’re performing those instruments and so on and so forth. I mean, is the future of gaming and VR, is that something that you could see yourself developing an interest in in the future? Because you always seem to be a step ahead of where you are. Robert Henke In my own personal view of myself, I’m not a step ahead, I’m actually a very conservative person in my usage of technology for instance. So I need to separate a little bit what I attempt to contribute with my colleagues at Ableton, where of course the question always is how does the world musically look like in five years or ten, because we have to find answers to that, and we’re working on this of course. And this is one part. And the other part is my artistic life. And in my artistic life, I reached a stage where I’d rather like to refine and explore all these loose threads that accumulated over the last 30 years of my life rather than throwing myself into something new. So I feel that I need to spend more time in the studio working on just electronic music, because I have so many ideas that I’d like to explore that are informed by the things I’m doing currently. But for those ideas, I don’t need new instruments, I don’t need new software, I don’t need new hardware, I just need time. And the same goes for my installation works, I’m not working with the latest technology, and I never did in a way. And I’d rather like to refine all these ideas which I have in my mind. So I don’t think that necessarily if I would try to learn… Let’s say programming Unity or whatever is the en vogue game engine these days would solve any artistic question. It would rather take all my time to learn the platform, and the same is true for buying new equipment. Of course I’m tempted to buy equipment because I like machines, I find synthesizers and reverb units and all these kind of things really sexy. There’s some things that are insanely beautiful, they’re engineering highlights, and I love them, but let’s say if I buy another digital synthesizer from the early 80s, it wouldn’t solve any artistic question at all. It wouldn’t make my compositions just one notch better, nothing, because I have more sounds in my library than I can ever use for the next 500 years, so the last thing I should spend my time with is looking on eBay if someone sells “insert great synthesizer here,” because it’s pointless. I still do sometimes, and afterwards I think, OK, now I spent an insane amount of money for this vintage reverb, but to be honest, this plugin which I recently got for free from this friend of mine is actually better. So I think I should not focus on new technologies, I should focus on new ways of expressing myself within my framework. Christine Kakaire I think that’s something we’re gonna come back to in a moment, but you mentioned Ableton, so I feel like this is probably a good time to introduce the background and your involvement in the development of Ableton Live. If we could look at photo number seven, please. Another one from the vault. Robert Henke Ah, this is… Christine Kakaire Can you describe what’s happening here? Robert Henke Well, this is me, I can clearly see that, it looks similar, yeah. And this other guy here is Mr. Gerhard Behles. I have been telling this story for so often that I won’t repeat it, I didn’t like this guy at all when I met him in Munich. I went to Berlin to start a new life, and guess who was in my first lecture in university? This guy. We became best friends, we started making music together, like here, and this guy at some point decided after finishing studying that a software company for music software would be the thing to do. He founded Ableton, he knocked on the door and said, “Robert, we need you.” I joined and, well, the rest you know. So what you see here is Mr. Gerhard Behles and myself playing a very conceptual concert. The synthesizer here, the Yamaha SY77, is a very complex machine which you can program in such a way that if you press down a few keys, there’s a lot of looping envelopes going on inside that create some very complex, long drone-y sounds that changes over time, and our conceptual idea was that we both start with the same sound, we press down on the same keys, use matches to keep them pressed down, and then we together start editing the sound. Every one, just in any way we wanted. So we get this different types of drone-y structures going on that grow further and further apart, or met again, and after half an hour, or whenever we felt like it’s enough, we went through all the parameters and made them the same again so that we ended at the same sound again. So after half an hour of playing, I said, “Operator one, release rate 15.” Gerhard, [mimics pressing buttons] clack, clack, clack, clack. Operator two, attack rate 12.” And I [mimics pressing buttons] clack, clack, clack, clack. Until we were back to the same sound again. And then we finished. So this was called the symmetrical concert, and we played it, as I said on the website, in front of audience as big as five people, and… Maybe this was ten here. And yeah, so much to this poster photo. And I guess the question was more about Ableton, right? Christine Kakaire Yeah, but we can go there in stages. I’m gonna bring up another photo, which is number 17, please. Robert Henke Ah. Christine Kakaire Yeah. Robert Henke Oh, you did your homework. Christine Kakaire I deep dived into your website. Robert Henke Is this online? Christine Kakaire Yeah, it is, it is. Oh, actually that wasn’t on your website, I found it somewhere else. But this is the PX18 sequencer. I’d love it if you could explain what is happening on this screen and how you developed this together with Gerhard. Robert Henke Okay, so this is a Max patch which Gerhard and me used for creating music both on stage and in the studio. And, let’s walk a little bit [gets up and walks over to the screen], so obviously this is one bar of music and velocities, and, this looked better when it was opened in Max 4. In Max 4 this whole thing didn’t look so strange. This photo was taken using the same Max patch in a later Max version which had a different graphic, so it’s a bit fucked up. So this is one, let’s call it clip, which has velocities and pitch and durations, and all kinds of things. This is 15 tracks or 16… No, 12 actually. And each track could play a different clip, quantized, and there’s an overall groove editor and there is some crazy shit which actually is not part of Live unfortunately, which allows to scramble the time. And there is something that allows to switch the patterns of each of these tracks in a timeline. So let’s call this the arranger. And so that’s a very basic step sequencer which we used to perform with. And it ran on a laptop and it had MIDI out, and the media went to synthesizer racks and stuff like that. And some of those ideas, in particular the idea that every single pattern can be switched at any time and that they can all switch together, found its way into Live. And so parts of the inspiration for Live came from trying out these things before. Christine Kakaire And also at this time that you were developing this step sequencer, you and Gerhard were also creating and performing music as well. Robert Henke Yes. Christine Kakaire As Monolake. Robert Henke That’s true. Christine Kakaire That is true. So I think that this is a good point to perhaps listen to something from that era, I believe it’s between like mid ‘90s to very early 2000s, where this PX18 step sequencer was really integral in the performance of your music. So let’s have a listen to, I believe it was your first EP, Cyan. Robert Henke Oh, sweet. Christine Kakaire Yeah. So let’s have a listen to Cyan I, and then we can resume… Robert Henke So I think I have probably not listened to this track for 15 years, so let’s… Christine Kakaire Let’s see if it stands up. Robert Henke But actually this track is older than this here. [points to PX18 on screen] (music: Monolake – “Cyan I”) Christine Kakaire Just to remind everyone what that was, that was “Cyan I” by Monolake from their first EP in 1997. Robert Henke So there’s a few comments to make on that track. The first one is, it is very obvious if you listen to this all these years later, that at this time there was a different idea of time in the type of music which was made in Berlin. This idea of an endless state was very predominant, because the first impulse when I listen to this now is, god, this is so slow. But after listening to it for a while, I get back in the mental state which was happening during this time and the fact that things changed so slow was actually welcome because it was a very definite statement against a three minute pop track. So, to wait til the change happens in your brain before it happens in the music, and, of course, if you listen to this whilst you’re being stoned it’s a different experience anyway. And that played a role at this time, undeniably. This track is also a great showcase of Gerhard performing the arpeggiator of the Juno-6 and this weird [makes mosquito noise] bassline is actually a mosquito. I made a recording of some flies for something and I just had this floppy with the mosquito in my sampler and we just transposed it down and suddenly this [makes low buzzing sound] showed up, and the bassline was there. This is the kind of experimentation which came very natural at this time. The byproduct was that there was all this annoying other birds in the background, which to me, from a 2018 sound perspective, are way too much in the foreground. But this was the trade off, either having this mosquito bassline plus the birds in the background or having not the mosquito bassline and the decision was clear, let’s just accept the birds. And yeah, so much about this track. The funny thing is that this track led to our first release on Chain Reaction simply because we were never intending to release this. We just played it to friends because we made tracks for ourselves for fun, for showing our friends, and one of our friends said, “Hey, did you play this to Mark [Ernestus] and Moritz [von Oswald]?” “No. Should we?” “Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you should.” And then I did, and I gave the DAT tape to Mark, and I was expecting him to listen to it immediately, and it was kind of… Mark just put it in his bag. Oh, OK. And then nothing happened, and I forgot about it, and a few weeks later, Mark just called me on my landline, because that was what we had at this time and said, “What’s the name of your project?” And I said, “Huh? Sorry, what?” Yeah, the DAT you gave me, what’s the name of the project? And I was conferencing with Gerhard and we have been on a kind of holiday trip together through the US, and we went from San Francisco to Las Vegas, and we passed a sign to a lake, but we didn’t have time to see the lake, and this was a lake called Mono Lake. And we thought, ah, it’s not interesting, and we just moved on. And then I went to a gas station and I saw a postcard of Mono Lake and I bought the postcard and went to Gerhard look and said, “Shit, look what we missed.” And so when Mark asked us what the name of the project is, I look at Gerhard and Gerhard looks at me and we say “Monolake.” And so the lake we never saw. And so that’s how that happened. Christine Kakaire And it’s definitely worth clarifying who Mark and Moritz are. Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald. Robert Henke OK, yeah. Sorry, yeah. So, a small scene at this time, everyone knew everyone. Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald founded the Basic Channel label and Chain Reaction, which was the offspring label which became the home of many of our friends and us. And this is how things happened. And this just shows how small everything was. That was very… Not driven by big money, not driven by the idea of selling lots of copies and not much marketing effort. Actually, no marketing at all, just the fact that it was existing and word of mouth was enough to keep this running. Christine Kakaire I’m also curious to know, at this time, late ‘90s Berlin, when Basic Channel, Chain Reaction, putting out these seminal releases. What was your experience of performing around the city? What kind of spaces were you moving within? Because I feel like later on in your career, the idea of factoring in spaces becomes one of the big tent poles of your approach to your work. So I’m curious to know what kind of spaces you were moving in at that time. Robert Henke That’s a good question. At this time, when performing spaces were not my main concern, I was way too occupied with the fact that suddenly I… Or we at the beginning have to perform somewhere. So we just, whenever someone asked us, we went there and it was just the usual setup, some dudes onstage in a club. There were some exceptions where we played different scenarios with multiple speakers and things like this. But this was… It was not my main focus at this time. My interest in performing multichannel and finding a different perspective came later when… No, came later, period. Yeah. Christine Kakaire OK. Well, let’s talk a little bit further about the development of Ableton Live. We’ve got another image. Robert Henke I’m so curious what comes now because I have a few suspicions of which kind of images. Christine Kakaire So we’re gonna look at number… No, we’ve lost it. Sorry everyone. Let’s look at number eight please. Robert Henke Ah. Christine Kakaire Yes. Robert Henke This was actually functional. It doesn’t look like this, but it worked. So this is how a very, very early pre-version one release version of Live looked like. And the funny thing is, if you look at this now, you notice that the basic concept still looks very familiar and I find this kind of cute. And with a version that only looks slightly better than this one, we went to the first NAMM show, which is the most important trade show for electronic music instruments, and showed this software. Yeah, I could talk a lot about this trade show and the reactions of the people to what they saw there. I don’t know how much time we have. Christine Kakaire I think it’d be great to share it because now obviously NAMM is… It’s a hugely important location and event for acoustic, but also electronic instruments. What was it like taking this new technology and presenting it to that kind of… Robert Henke Just a question. Do you also intend to show this fantastic photo of Gerhard and me after the trade show? Christine Kakaire No, I didn’t know it existed. Robert Henke Oh, too bad. Because there’s a really hilarious photo of us, but if you don’t have it, OK, even better. So we went to NAMM show, and if you have not much money then you are having a really small booth, like the size of that space. [delineates a small space next to the couch] Pretty much the screen here in a smaller version and the little thing to put a laptop and show this and two loudspeakers, and not many people showed up at our place because we were at the very end, and next to us were some company who sold some really bad notation software and some strange company selling something else strange, which I forgot. And we showed this strange software which looked very different from anything people knew at this time. This was the time when Reason just came out with these dangling cables and photorealistic renderings and three-dimensional stuff. And this was the opposite. What happened was that people from other companies came by and said, “Sorry, what? This is a software you want to use on a laptop on stage? You guys are nuts.” Laptop on stage, ha ha. [laughs sarcastically] And they left. Then other company guys came and said, “Oh, this interface looks horrible. Can’t you hire a graphics designer?” And they left. Well, we were confident enough to survive that because at some point… First of all, we knew that laptops on stage worked because we have been doing this. You have to imagine, just to give a context of the time, the typical advertisement for music software at this time looked like this. You have a full color photo page in Keyboard magazine with a photo of one of those studio mixing desks, which goes basically from this end of the room [motions from one side of the room to the other] to that end. So you’ll see this photo and leather and all very nice. I’m not making this up, I have this photo right in my memory, and the Porsche car key on the desk. This was the advertisement for Logic at this time. So the image they wanted to convey for their software, this is professional software for the successful professional producer and the professional producer is a Porsche driver with a big console and a big studio. So something that is on a laptop on stage for techno nerds doesn’t fit in this image is obvious. And this was our great chance because these customers were not recognized, this concept of performing wasn’t recognized, this idea of actually making music as performance was not recognized. So we were the freaks and in our niche we were happy. When we started Ableton, we kind of knew that we will sell enough copies that a small company can survive because we knew that our friends would be interested and that there’s friends of friends of friends out there who share similar ideas. So we kind of knew that something like this fulfils a desire of people who try to make electronic music and who couldn’t do it the same way before. So we took that for granted. But what we didn’t anticipate was that the market could be much larger. And what happened, and I think it happened on the second day of the first NAMM show, was some guy came by, a little bit older than us, and the usual LA style, black suit and everything in black and glasses, perhaps. I don’t know. I can’t remember that. And he was followed by maybe five, six significantly younger people also looking like the classical LA composers, also in black. Imagine Nine Inch Nails all over the place. And this guy said, “So what is this, what do you have here?” And I say, “Yeah, well this is software for performing on stage and I can put in a loop here and I can change the tempo without changing the pitch and I can add a second loop and it runs in sync. He interrupts me and says, “So you can change the tempo without changing the pitch? So you can do this without steps in between? So I can maybe ramp up the tempo from, let’s say, 110 BPM to 200 BPM continuously over two minutes?” I said, “Yeah, sure. I can show you.” Clack, clack, clack, clack. And I did from 30 BPM to 999. And he says, “Oh, this is pretty cool. You can’t, by any chance, combine this with Pro Tools?” And the funny thing is, we kind of, in a very smart move from the very beginning, implemented a protocol called Rewire, and Rewire allows you to do exactly that, that you can connect any piece of software to Pro Tools and run it as a slave. So I just said, “Yeah, sure we can. It has Rewire.” “Oh, it has Rewire. Nice.” It was also, I believe, the first music software that came out to run under OS X. So there were a lot of points for this person to be happy. And then this person left, and I was very occupied with explaining this software to him so I didn’t really look at his name tag. Everyone has a name tag on the trade show. So I had my exhibitor trade name tag and this guy had his name tag with ‘Visitor.’ And right before he left, I looked at his name tag, ‘Hans Zimmer.’ And so I thought, oh, OK. Well… So half an hour later, someone came by, said, “Hey, I heard you have something interesting. Hans sent me.” 35 minutes later, another person came by and said, “Hi, hello. Can you tell me what you’re selling here? What is this software?” And so basically, Hans Zimmer was really impressed, and if Hans Zimmer is impressed and excited about something, he shares it with his other people. And the other people say, “Hans saw something exciting there at the very end, this green little box there. You have to check it out.” So suddenly all these people showed up and we thought, hm, maybe this thing we are doing here could also be interesting for people who are outside our primary focus. That was one of the first points where we got an idea that perhaps we’re doing something that is a bit larger than what we anticipated. And then it grew like this over the years. And our biggest surprise for the first four or five releases was always that we were, every single time we went a trade show, we thought, OK, now one of the big companies must have a product which is a perfect copy of that but better. Because we were a small company with maybe ten developers at the beginning, and a company like Apple or Steinberg, or Yamaha, or whoever, any of the big companies could just say, OK, Department X, build a copy of that, but better. And this would have been the end of Ableton because with the marketing power and the customer base of one of the big hard or software players, they could just exceed what we have done by far. But they didn’t because they still didn’t see that this is a market. And at the point when they really realized it, it was too late because we were so established that everyone wanted to use Live. And so that’s the story. Christine Kakaire That’s a great story. So we’re now at version 10 of Live. What has your involvement been in the development of these different iterations of it? Because I know that you have stepped back from direct involvement with Ableton. So like what has been your involvement through these various phases? Robert Henke Multiple. I’m kind of… Let’s start with my current involvement because that’s easier to explain. I’m in a very luxurious position. Officially, I have the role of an external advisor, which means everything and nothing. But practically, I’m occupying myself with some details I find interesting or really important to focus on. Some of the stuff which has to do with everything related to sound processing, sound generation. I was involved in the wavetable synthesizer, I was involved with a few other improvements of the effects. This was always kind of my main domain, officially. But I basically look at every single aspect of the software and talk with people about what I think is a good thing to improve, what I believe is going in the wrong direction, and basically try to put in my experience as someone who is using the software all the time and who’s talking with millions of people… I’m exaggerating, 20 people about this software and observing how other people use it and where people fail, and try to get this knowledge from the outside into the company and trying to, on the level of small details, try to improve things. And the other thing is that I’m, of course, part of this group who really thinks about what do we do for next release, what do we do for the next five years? So I’m always kind of navigating myself from the tiny detail of implementation of parameter ranges, of colors, of really anal detail because I’m one of those, to the great picture of saying we need to do more for people who want to do stuff that is not metric in music. I’d like Live to be able to handle odd rhythms and polymetric, polyrhythmic stuff better than it does at the moment. Is there anyone who is with me in this regard and can we allocate resources for that? Stuff like this. Christine Kakaire As Live has grown in popularity and become almost ubiquitous, I suppose, in certain parts of electronic music, how has it sat with you, this idea of the ‘Abletonification’ of electronic music? The idea that it has… Let me put it this way. It sounds like the initial impetus and the catalyst to develop these tools was to really revolutionize the idea of performance, but I feel like Ableton, in certain quarters, has received criticism for restricting performance to a very standardized, I suppose, type of expression. How does that sit with you? Robert Henke Well, it’s of course true, simply due to the fact that every instrument has a character. And it has to have a character because there is no such thing as a neutral instrument. And it makes a few things very easy to do, and it makes other things impossible or very hard to achieve. And it’s in the very nature of people using instruments that the things which are easy and obvious are the things people do. If you play a guitar, it’s far easier to play the chord progressions which are easy for your fingers than coming up with the most bizarre Flamenco or whatever. I’m sorry, I’m not a guitar player. But it doesn’t keep anyone from moving far, far away from what you do if you play guitar for a year. And I think electronic music software and hardware in general made it very, very easy to achieve the standard because it took away a lot of the pain we had in the beginning. The interesting question now is, if the computer makes all these things easy, what do we do as an artist? And the one solution is, let’s make the same track everyone else made in five minutes, or, I still spend four weeks or longer on a track and try to make something that is different despite the fact that the basics are simple. And there’s people doing it, and it’s obvious. So I think I never heard a serious composer I admire complaining about the simplicity of tools because they are happy that basic things are simple and then they find ways to express themselves. Of course, it became much easier to have two loops running in sync together, but everyone now knows that having two beat loops running in sync is easy. So if you’re listening to a piece of music that contains two beat loops running in sync, you’re not freaking out about the fact that they’re in sync because you know that this is simple. We got used to it. So we’re expecting something more engaging, more interesting. In a way, compare it to photography. A long time ago, it was much harder to make photos that had fantastic colors because it’s a magical chemical process to make good color prints. Nowadays, with state-of-the-art CCD sensor chips in a cheap camera, no one is amazed anymore by photos with nice colors. It’s just photos with nice colors. The internet is full of them. Still, people can make really, really interesting photos. You just need to find your own expression. And I see the same thing with Live. There’s no shortage of using Live in the most bizarre ways to create your own musicality. I mean, the funny thing is, in general, what I have personal problems with is when I look at the synthesizer plugin and I play one note and this plays back this whole complex series of things going on, I feel lost as an artist. Because if I play a note and it’s like, [makes crazy synthesizer noises] and there’s a whole Richard Devine track coming out of one single note, where does this leave me with my inspiration? So I’m rather happy if I play a note and there’s a sine wave, and I need to play 500 notes to make something complicated. But of course, then you enter the realm of professional music production. A lot of the music which is made and a lot of the software which is sold, and the hardware, is sold to people who make music for a living for commercials or whatever. And if you make a commercial and the director is sitting behind you and says, “I want this,” [makes crazy synthesizer noises] you’re not starting to say, “OK, let me combine this sample of a pen falling down and let me put this in the key mode to time stretch it and, oh, we are already at the next queue. Sorry. How about…” [makes crazy synthesizer noises] “That’s great, we take it.” This is the reality of music production for a lot of people. So there is a feedback between the products which are offered and the demands of the market. So there is a market for creating instant amazing results, and this was the case when the first synthesizer came out with presets. People didn’t buy the DX7 because the synthesis algorithm was so amazing and everyone wanted to dive deep into the magic of FM synthesis. They bought the DX7 because, hey, you turn it on and here is my Rhodes, and here is my flute, and here is my tubular bells. That’s why they bought it. The fact that, probably, you could have sold 95% of the DX7s without any capability of programming anything whatsoever, because people just use the thing which is right there. It’s only the few freaks who are trying to dive deep into their own expression. Christine Kakaire I’m wondering, maybe this will be a nice segway into the next topic I want to talk about, this idea of perhaps challenging yourself and challenging your modes of expression, to not take the path most traveled. If we can talk about your work with audiovisual installations and also with lasers. I mean, generally speaking, are these types of ventures things that you’ve undertaken because it does present extra elements of needing to engage your engineer brain to solve these problems of how to express something artistically? Robert Henke Well, there is some truth in this assumption. First of all, I was always interested also in the visual side of artistic expression. Same time, I discovered Jean-Michel Jarre I was also running around in museums and I always was looking at abstract painting, 20th century stuff, Dan Flavin. You know, all kinds of things that were really simple, abstract, and powerful. And when I started becoming part of the Berlin club scene I spent equal time working on the decoration and illumination of the places which we explored. So the visual side was always an interest, it just never occurred to me until very late in my career that I could see myself as an audiovisual artist. It sounds strange in retrospective that I didn’t see that. But I just couldn’t see that being an artist, that calling myself an artist, would be an option. That’s a really, really funny thing. If you had asked me ten years ago what I am, I would always say I’m an engineer. I would never say I’m an artist. Yeah, I make music, yeah, sure. And I sell records, yeah sure. And I perform live, yes. But artist, no. This is a kind of result of maybe an upbringing, result of education, result of lack of self-confidence, all these kinds of things. Anyway, at some point in my career, I decided that I needed to provide visuals to my music, mainly due to the fact that if I didn’t, other people did, and the result was not good. I remember that something like in the early 2000s, it started with this VJ culture at clubs and festivals, and I was always allocated some random VJ when I was performing. So I was performing my music and at some point I looked behind me and I thought, what is that? Architecture mirrored, OK. Color circles mirrored, porn slash architecture again. This has nothing to do with my music. This is arbitrary. So my solution was, I wrote a little Max patch to draw simple geometric shapes, so at least I understood that this is not cool, but it was at least better than having the randomness behind me. That was kind of a first attempt to do audiovisual things, but without any intention to turn this into an art form. This was more an avoidance strategy. Then it happened that I ran into Tarik Barri, because I looked for a programmer to help me with things, and he offered me some help. It didn’t work out, but he sent me some visual things he did at this time, this was something like maybe 10 years ago. I thought, hey, I shouldn’t make videos, he should make videos for me. So I knocked at his door and said, “Hey, do you like to go on tour with me?” He said, “Yeah, sure, why not.” So I gave away my visual aspirations to Tarik, who is a genius. And completely independent from that, at some point I got asked to do something for a gallery. I did sound installations before, multichannel stuff, which just run forever. This is something I did already in the early ‘90s, because I like this idea of music as an infinite continuum, where you enter a space, and music is running, and you leave the space, and it’s still running. In a way, sound installation and Berghain is the same, and club culture in general. This is the idea of an endless state, which you immerse yourself in as long as you want. In this regard, I perceived, for instance, going to Berghain not so much going to a concert, but rather visiting an installation. That’s a nice art installation, and I’m participating in that. So I got asked for a gallery to do some audiovisual stuff, and it just happened to me that I thought, why not working with a laser? I know how it works technically, due to my technical curiosity, so I had an understanding what I could do in theory. Long story short, it didn’t work out with this gallery. But this idea was seeded in my brain to work with lasers. It was an interesting idea in that way, that when you were Googling ‘laser show’ at this time, all you saw was a really, really horrible thing. Like green tunnels, really cheesy animations of company logos and colors turning around. Nothing was precise, nothing was clear, nothing was structured, nothing had rhythm. Everything was not what I wanted. That opened the door for me to say, “OK, let’s see if I can turn this into something different.” Then I kind of got hooked on this medium, because it’s so limited. The interesting thing with, and also the fact is… There’s so much excellence out there in the audiovisual domain especially when it comes to doing video, pixel-based graphics. There’s people doing amazing stuff. If I just think about what Tarik Barri does, what Johnny Lamaze does, what millions of… Billions of billions, what a lot of other people do out there. I thought it’s pointless for me to try to compete with them, because that’s not my main expertise. But if I use a very limited medium, which forces me to think of the core of rhythm and structure, then I have a chance to apply my ideas of composition to the audiovisual world. That’s why I decided that lasers are interesting. And all I do with my lasers is either try to explore the generation of shapes at the edge of what the medium is capable of doing, or exploring rhythmical successions of simple things, and both are very close to how I think about music. So in a way, working with my lasers is exactly the same type of thinking as composing music. As a matter of fact, everything is driven by Max patches, so it’s even the same technological background. To give you an idea about why working with lasers is such a puzzle, such a difficult thing to do, how it works is you have one laser source, which is just a super sharp beam of light, and you have two tiny mechanical mirrors, and one mirror moves the beam up and down and the other mirror moves the beam left and right. Then of course, you can turn on and off the laser, and if you have three different colors, then you can mix the colors, but that’s basically it. It’s all mechanical. It’s really archaic. And if you want to draw a line, well, you just move one mirror back and forth, back and forth, and you get a line, if you do this fast enough. If you want to have a circle, you move the two mirrors, one with a sine wave, the other with a cosine wave, and you get a circle. You do this 20 or 30 times, or 100 times per second, and your eye is so slow that you see a nice circle, and not one beam moving around. Drawing one circle is very simple. Drawing two circles is a completely different issue, because you draw one circle, and you stop, and you turn the laser beam off. Then you move whilst the laser beam is off, with the mirror to one point in the second circle. Then you turn the laser back on. Then you start drawing the second circle, then you turn the laser back off. You go back to somewhere in the first circle, you repeat this. And you do this constantly, nonstop. And that means the mathematics behind that for two circles, is significantly more complex than for one circle, and if you want to do this with six circles moving around you get all kinds of complexities going on. So everything is a challenge when working with lasers, and everything is difficult. That means you start really embracing simple shapes, and you start thinking about timing a lot. Square, square, square, darkness, [long pause] square. [laughter] This becomes satisfying. You would never do this with video, because it wouldn’t feel right, because it would feel too simple, but with these intense bright laser beams, these things become meaningful. And so I use a simple medium and try to do something meaningful with it. Also in times where electronic music is so full of abundance I can choose between millions of sounds all the time, I can layer 10,000 sounds on my laptop. Working with a medium where everything is tedious clears my head because there is no sense of yeah, I just add five more circles. No, you can’t. You work with this single line of light until it feels right, and this is a great exercise in simplification and in rhythm and in shapes. Christine Kakaire I think we should definitely take a look at some of this work that you’ve been talking about. What we’re going to play is video number two, and I chose this one… This is a work of yours called Fragile Territories… Robert Henke Ah. Nice. Christine Kakaire …which I believe is from 2012, and the reason I chose it is because a year, or two years ago, here, at the Funkhaus during Loop festival it was installed in a room upstairs, so I thought that that would be a really nice kind of tie in. Robert Henke Fantastic. Christine Kakaire So if you could play a little bit of that now. Robert Henke So, all you see now, that’s four beams of light. All the shapes you see are just four lasers moving around. This piece is nice because it only works due to the imperfections of the technology, which is always an interesting thing to explore. And this is something no professional laser show would do, because this is where the professional laser show would always say you can’t do this with these machines, and if I write my own software, I can say I embrace the fact that there’s problems. So what you’re going to see is vertical and horizontal lines. These are programed. All the lines which are not exactly vertical and horizontal are the results of the mechanical mirrors moving the shortest possible path from one step to another. These are the things which normally, in the professional laser show, you would turn off the laser beam. But I’m not turning them off, I expose them and well, you will see what happens. Christine Kakaire That was Fragile Territories. Robert Henke Would it be possible to have a still of this displayed? [points to screen] Christine Kakaire Let’s see. Robert Henke Challenging the technical people. Ah, fantastic, cool. A few things I’d like to add if you have time for this. Christine Kakaire Sure. Robert Henke The one thing is that this is huge, which is a property of lasers which makes them a lot of fun. I can draw this as large as I want. A person would be that, [walks over to screen to illustrate scale] so my hand is a person. This is pitch black, because unlike video, there’s just no beam of light. So this is pitch black, and this can be really, really bright. This is something that of course in a video, doesn’t show like this. Here, I did something that I came up with for accident. This is an orange laser beam. Basically, the laser beam moves here, and at some point, defined by some mathematical function, I turn on a second laser beam, inside the laser, which is orange. I superimpose this orange line here, so this is all black and white, and there’s one orange thing moving around, which I found kind of cute. It’s a purely aesthetic decision, it has no further meaning apart from the fact that I liked it. You saw this black shadow moving there, and that’s an interesting one because as I told you, this is basically four lasers doing stuff and they overlap, because unlike video, with lasers, you never have a defined… Well, you have a defined size, but with video, it’s very clear. Here’s a pixel, here’s a pixel. This is the end of the screen. [points to the corners of the screen] You would not draw something on the screen that is only this size, [spreads fingers over middle of screen] because that would be a waste, and you can certainly not draw anything here. [moves hand beyond the edge of the screen] With lasers, it’s always a negotiation between speed of drawing and size. And that means I can deliberately draw, for instance, larger than a screen, or I can get very small. And what happens here with those four lasers is that one important aspect of this work was that I wanted to deliberately hide the fact that this is four lasers, so that they are all communicating with each other in such a way that this becomes one unified shape, which is technically a challenge. And as a first test, to see if this can work at all, I created this simple blanking pattern, where I’m just turning the lasers on and off, step by step, basically, as a test to see if they run in sync. So I programmed an earlier version of this and then I added this black shadow just as a test signal. And at some point after a lot of adjustment, it felt really like this one black shadow moving was through, and then I was happy, test achieved, and I turned it off. And then something interesting happened psychologically. I thought, hm, it looks flat. It looked far cooler with the shadow. So I understood that the shadow is an important part of the work, It just happened via experimentation. So I gave the shadow a mass, and I gave it a mass by applying this [makes wooshing noise] sound. This has eight channels of sound, so when the shadow moves here, [gestures across the screen from left to right] this low noise follows the shadow. So If you’re standing here [points at the audience] and the installation is here, [points at the wall] you really have the sound following the shadow, like the sound of a black blade actually going in front. And again, unlike video, if this black shadow moves here, [gestures across the screen from left to right] it’s really pitch black. You can’t distinguish it from someone actually manually blocking the beam. So people really believed that someone is manually blocking the beams. And I did some other interesting detail there. You hear these high pitched sounds, and they’re also distributed all over the installation, and whenever the black shadow comes, I’m slightly removing the high frequencies, just as if someone is standing in front of the speakers, [moves in front of one of the speakers] the high frequencies are gone, and I do the same thing with the black shadow. This makes this black shadow even more physical. So the experience is there’s an evil black object in front of that, and, well, that’s kind of how it happened. The other thing is that when I do such things, time becomes a very important point. I spend a lot of time inside my installations, which are all running on Max patches, and fine tune the change over time. How long can something be static? When does it need to change? You can’t test this really on a small screen, or in a small setup in an atelier space, you have to test it in a large space. So I’m sitting there, and I observe how long can one situation stay? When is it too long? When does it needs to change. Then I adjust it till it feels right in a specific space. And then the next day when the opening is, I observe the people, and I check it again with the people, and then I might even fine tune it again. All this work always gets its final shape in collaboration with the audience, in a way. It’s pretty much like when you make music, and you almost finish a track, and then you play it to your best friends, and you notice, ah, this part here, this is too short, this part is too long, and you change it. And I do the same with those installations, so they are always finished basically the next day, after the opening, before I leave. [returns to the couch] Christine Kakaire Thank you for that. That was a fantastic explanation. I’m going to show a couple more photos. If we can have a look at number 15. Any moment now. Looks like this is in a studio, and I believe that this is working on the laser installation for the From Within show. Robert Henke OK. [moves back to the screen] So, no lasers this time, this is just a bunch of LEDs, and this is my atelier space, which I have since half a year, and which makes it possible for me to try large scale things without turning my living room into a workspace. Sometimes it’s funny how long it takes from an idea to reality. I’m working with lasers since 10 years, and since half a year, I have a space which actually allows me to do it. Before that, I did it in my living room. Don’t ask me why I didn’t get a space earlier. Anyway, so, this is LED sticks, which is again, a very limited technology. This is 85 pixels, 48 sticks in one row, and two times 24 sticks in another row, and this is part of the stage design for the From Within concert, which will happen on Thursday, which is a collaboration between me and a composer called Marko Nikodijevic, who is writing for ensemble and does things I have no clue about, and I learn a lot from him every single day. And yeah, those LED sticks are in use as a visual component together with the composition. There are a few things here which are kind of important to mention. The spacing of these LED sticks is a random spacing, because I deliberately didn’t want to have a regular grid like everyone, because everyone is doing regular grids. So I thought let’s do something irregular. But of course, the software completely knows the placement of every stick. So even when the spacing is irregular, I can do regular movements within these spacings, but the visual appearance is different. There is some interesting rhythm going on here just because of the spacing of the LEDs, and it’s very low resolution, so it’s the opposite of high resolution video screen. And it’s RGB and it can do different colors. This is Selma, an intern at this time who is a pretty good touch designer programmer and helped me a lot. This is Ableton Live running on one computer, this is Max running on a different one. This is a so-called email client. [laughter] And, yeah, that’s it. [returns to couch] Christine Kakaire Well, the next photo which is number 16, which is seeing this LED construction in action. Robert Henke Unfortunately not, this is a mock up. Christine Kakaire Oh, is it? Robert Henke Yeah. But the reality does, slightly, look similar. This is in my dream world how it’s supposed to look like. But, wait a minute, there’s something more to talk about. [moves back to the screen] So these are actually the real musicians, these faces you will see on Thursday. This part here, this black monolith here, [points to a large, suspended row of speakers above the musicians] is 48 nice little loud speakers, and usually, the scenario for concerts is you have a line array, a lot of speakers here on the right and a lot of speakers here on the left. The problem is, if you really like the sound of these 30 people performing, the sound from the cello comes from here, [points to the cellist in the image] and it has a specific radiation pattern, and the sound from these gongs come from here [points to the percussionist in the image] and have a different pattern, and every musician has a place on stage. And then comes some electronic sound, and it comes from here blasting and from here. [points to the edges of the image] It’s completely disconnected. And what happens very often is in such events, that you put microphones on all the musicians, so that the musicians come also from here, [points again to the edges of the image] which effectively kills all the spatial placement of the orchestra, and turns the orchestra into a recording of an orchestra. So, if you really don’t want to do this, and you say, I want to experience a world-famous orchestra just as it was experienced 100 years ago, or as it can be experienced with any composition that involves no electronics, you can’t just have two speakers left and right. And this is when I thought how about having 48 speakers and using… [laughter] Yeah, we'll come to how I managed that in a second. Sometimes having an idea and making it happen works out. So, 48 speakers here and a technology called wave field synthesis, which I don’t want to go into detail. The main point of it is you can use this technique to create some really strange sound effects inside the audience, and you can use this technique to get a very convincing, very deep sound field that makes you forget about the fact that there are speakers. Plus, of course, it looks cool. It looks kind of monolith, 2001-ish. I had this idea that I would like to do that, and of course, this is way too expensive. It just happened that I had an interview with someone who is doing marketing for a loud speaker manufacturer I really admire, d&b Audiotechnik, near Stuttgart. They build some of the best PA systems on this planet, and I just called this guy and said, “We had this nice talk recently, and I have a completely crazy idea. I just want to share this idea with you. Maybe d&b has… Can help me a little bit.” And to my great surprise, they said, “Well, this sounds really cool. We’re working on a new processor for controlling a lot of speakers at the same time. That would be a perfect test case for that.” So, it happened that they offered to provide this speaker system for the premiere in Paris, and for this event here in Berlin, basically for free. This is something that made me pretty speechless, and I found it very remarkable [returns to the couch] because this is really something that is not justified by marketing efforts. This is really something that people do because they are genuinely interested in making this happen. We had some tests at their facility, and especially the test, we have these virtual sound sources in front of the speakers, and the person who was mainly responsible for this sponsoring was just standing there and said, “This is unbelievable. [laughter] This is, it, it really works.” He was just like a little boy and was fascinated by that. These are the moments where I’m extremely happy about what I can do, because very often, I’m in a situation where I meet people who have the same excitement, who do the things they do because of the love for what they’re doing, and not because someone told them to do, or because they think about a big investment. Of course, at some point, you think about what does it cost, can we do it, but very, very often, the motivation for doing things is, I have a great idea, let’s see how we can make it happen. This general attitude is what I experience very, very often when working with people in the field of electronic music, in this type of audiovisual festivals. There’s a spirit here that is driven by, and still is, after all these years, by the desire to make something cool happen. So I hope this is going to be cool in Berlin. We’re still working on it. It’s an enormous amount of effort, and there were elements of the premiere in Paris which we were not happy with because it would need much more time than we had. It’s always like this, never is there enough time but you need deadlines anyways, so it’s kind of always a fight. We had a similar fight and still have for Berlin. Right after this talk here and after my interviews, I go back and continue working, and then I continue working tomorrow and then we setup and we will see how far we go with that. But there’s also moments in it where I feel a sense of achievement. And a last note about Marko. Marko is a composer. OK, I never obviously learned composition. I’m completely self-taught, and I know synthesis inside out. My musical skills came from listening and from trying things out. I have a tiny little bit of music theory background, but everyone who has just basically one music theory lesson will beat me in that. Marko is a classically trained composer who started to study composition when he was 15. He’s 38 now, and this is what he makes his living off, and working together with someone with that background, who at the same time goes to Berghain and has a profound knowledge about Ableton Live, is a blessing, because working with him over the last year or so, very much changed my perspective on essential musical aspects like form, like reason for things. It’s not so much about writing for a cello or a flute or extended playing techniques for oboe, it is about why is this note at this position in time, and why is this phrase repeating for four bars, this should be five bars. And then he can explain why. You listen to the explanation, and it makes sense. This is something that very much changed my perspective on music, and very much changed my perspective on how I will compose in the future. So for me, the outcome of this specific collaboration is two sides. The one is the actual concert, where I hope that we will be satisfied, but I’m not 100% convinced, simply because of the difficulty of it and the lack of time, and the other thing is that this whole collaboration changed my perception of my own work in such a way that I profoundly believe that I will make different types of music afterwards. So it will still be my music, of course, and it will still be my ideas of sounds and of rhythm and of shapes. But I will much more focus on overall form, and on overall reasoning between this block comes here, and then this block there, and this block there, and why is there repetition and why is there a change here. This is the part which I tremendously enjoy about collaboration, that you suddenly are confronted with a person who has profound knowledge about something you have no knowledge about and at the end of the day, you learn something, and the other person learns something too and you come up with something that, ideally, is bigger than what every person can do by themselves. This brings me back to the very beginning. The reason why my friendship with Gerhard Behles is so important is because we’re so different. Gerhard very often thinks exactly the opposite of what I do, and then we need to discuss. Once we come to agreement, we can be quite certain that we’re on the right track. This is why I didn’t like this guy at the beginning in Munich, when I met him first, and this is why I tremendously enjoy every moment I can have with him these days, because he’s not a person who always says, “Oh, yes, that’s a great idea.” But who’s really questioning my input, and at the same time, finds it equally important that I question his input. Because, also interesting, he says, “The problem is, if you’re in a certain position, like the CEO of a company, it’s far too likely that people don’t question your things, because, hey, he’s the CEO.” And I’m in a position where I can and I am allowed to say, “Are we really sure that this is a good idea?” So that was the circuit to the beginning of this Ableton thing. Christine Kakaire Well, I think speaking of collaboration, this is probably a nice moment to play one last track, from this record called P A N. I was going to play “Nmos,” but I think we should flip it over and play the track that you co-produced with Electric Indigo. Robert Henke But “Nmos” is actually the track I like more. Christine Kakaire OK, well let’s play that. Robert Henke I mean, it’s already… Christine Kakaire It’s queued up, it’s already on 45, so. Robert Henke Funny thing is, on my early records, there was never a hint if it’s 33 or 45, because the whole philosophy was, well, whatever works for you works. I experienced a few times that I went to a place and they played the track with the wrong speed, and my first attempt, my first initial impulse is going to the DJ and say, “It is 33.” My second impulse is, “Sounds good this way.” I like the idea that the concept of a track is something that is made for people to play with. [puts the needle on the record] This is a Technics Quartz SL-1200 limited, in gold. Feels pretty much the same as the normal one, but it’s gold. (music: Monolake – “Nmos”) Christine Kakaire So that was “Nmos” by Monolake. Robert Henke So that’s a funny experience listening to this one, because I perform the material of this track very often live. I haven’t heard through this track since basically I did it, and since when I perform live I always change things, this now is in a completely different state. It still has the same sounds, but the structure and the mix and everything is far, far away from that, and I would never edit it like this anymore after playing it for one-and-a-half years. The thing which I still like on this one is there’s the synthetic kind of voice saying something like, “sin” or “Sid” or whatever this is. This is a spoken word, indeed the word “sin,” re-synthesized on a historical piece of equipment, the Synclavier, which once was the most expensive machine money could buy, and is a technological masterpiece and milestone of the early 1980s. Due to the fact that in the early 2000s no one was interested anymore in digital hardware synthesizers, people threw away a lot of fantastic digital equipment for almost nothing because they believed that computers can do everything, and I got my hands on one of those nice machines for a very low price and then I spent a lot of money to actually get it working. But a lot of the sounds on this record have been made with this machine, and the interesting part for me about this machine is that it combines a very rough type of synthesis that sounds very outdated with something that still feels futuristic, and I have a nice, kind of personal relationship to this whole system. It’s a true music computer from a different era. It’s a big rack which only contains the computer system. It has an external computer screen, green on blue, and a keyboard and everything is super slow and it feels like the future of 30 years before. And when I work with this machine I have to get used to the pace of it. So all these operations are slow. You type in a command, you see the text building up again, then you type the other command and you see the text building up again. So it kind of enforces a certain mental state, and to me, this mental state is something I really enjoy when working with it because every single result I get becomes, again, important. So I create some variation, I type in a few numbers, and I get a new sound, and instead of immediately deleting it, I listen to it a few times because maybe it is good. Yeah, so much about this. Christine Kakaire I think as a final question before we open it up to the floor, it’s interesting hearing you talk about this and talking about your work with lasers, and I’m interested in this concept of you working in situations where there are limits, where it’s not just like a boundless plane of experimentation, where you’re kind of giving yourself restrictions and giving yourself limits, and I watched a talk that you did where it was literally called Give Me Limits. I think it might be really interesting for the participants here to hear from somebody who has your long history as an artist, as an engineer, as a technologist, also as an academic, about, perhaps, the benefits of enforcing limits or including limits in your creative process. Robert Henke Well, I guess most of it, at least in between the lines I mentioned already… Whenever you want to create something, the process of creation is a process of exclusion. You exclude ideas. So you have 88 keys on a piano, you choose a scale. You remove some keys. You have only maybe ten fingers, so you don’t play more than a few notes at the same time. You have a limit of the speed of your fingers, so you play only a limited number of notes over a period of time. So everything is… Every artistic occupation in that way is limiting. Or you write a book, you find a topic. Finding a topic is not, here is the big empty void and then here’s the topic. Finding the topic is, here are all the possible topics of the world, which I ignore to use this topic. So, it’s the opposite of this idea of there’s nothing and then the artwork comes up. It’s, there’s everything and I remove and I remove and I remove and here’s the artwork. Just like the bass drum there, actually on this record. There’s too much bass drum. There needs to be a break inbetween, and the bass drum itself sometimes has too many high frequencies going on. It would be better if it would be less. So, as a matter of fact, with a distant view on my own work I would reduce it even further because I believe it would be more to the point if it’s more reduced, and then it opens up space for something else, so I could make a few elements louder, and then this whole thing would be more convincing. At least that’s my own perspective to that now, when I listen to it again. So it’s always a process of reduction. It’s always a process of how little can you do and still be convincing. Then within this little thing, you get the… You open up the space for moving things around. It’s basically that you create space. So by removing topics, you can go deeper into one topic. By removing elements in a composition, you have more freedom to actually arrange them in time, because they’re not covered by other elements. Just as a thought experiment, if all you have is a bass drum. Imagine you have five minutes and you have just a bass drum and nothing else. You would not do for five minutes, “Bong, bong, bong, bong,” because you have to be creative with that. So you start thinking about every possible combination of rhythmical things you can do with this bass drum. It’s a fantastic exercise, actually, if you think about it. Five minutes, just a bass drum, make a song. Of course, if you have a huge song then you can have for five minutes a bass drum going straight four-to-the-floor because there’s all the other elements. So, the more of it you remove, the more every single element becomes a challenge. And that’s kind of cool. Another exercise which I gave my students when I was teaching, and got some amazing results, was… So I was teaching at a department which was also concerned with audiovisual stuff. Imagine you make a movie and you have 25 pixels. So every single frame has 25 pixels, and you only have 25 frames. So your whole movie is 25 things of 25 pixels, and each pixel can only be on and off. This is extremely limited. But, actually, you can arrange these 25 pixels in any way you want. So you can make one line of 25 pixels. You can have five to five pixels. Students were able, within these 25 frames, so you can draw this movie on a sketchbook in lunch break, you can make a whole story of the creation of the world, and love and hate, with nothing but 25 blocks of black and white stones. This is really cool, to figure out that you can be super emotional, even, with something as limited like this. So imagine there’s one black dot showing up on the first frame on the first, on the left. There’s another frame, another black dot showing up on the right. They move towards each other. At some point, when the first one moves two steps at some point, the other one steps back to the very end. You’re at the beginning of a story. These are two things which interact with each other, and they can meet, and suddenly everything can become flickery. That could be interpreted as whatever you want, you know? You can tell stories, and I find this really fascinating, how you can become creative with the least amount of elements, and if you go back to electronic music, where you have the ability to shape every single one of these elements to be the most beautiful, shiny element ever, so… Going back to the bass drum example, if you really want to have this one bass drum for five minutes, there’s nothing wrong with shaping this bass drum for two days until it’s the perfect sounding bass drum which actually you enjoy listening to over small speakers, big speakers, gigantic speakers, and in a way, I try to keep this thinking alive that I try to achieve something with very limited amounts and not get caught up by this very easy route of just adding more to feel comfortable. So reduction is the most difficult thing to achieve, I guess. Christine Kakaire Well, I hope we’ve managed to achieve scratching the surface. Thank you so much for being here. Please, everybody, give Robert Henke a huge thank you. [applause] So at this point we’re going to open up questions, don’t be shy, put your hand up. Yeah, we’ve got one over here already. Audience Member Hello. Oh, that’s so loud. OK, first of all, thank you very much for sharing the whole experience. I mean, I find it very, very inspiring how passionate you are about all the stuff you talk about. It is inspiring for a lot of us who are upcoming musicians, producers, and some of us hopefully artists too. So my question is, since you talk a lot about art and how art works and how your art works, I wanted to know your opinion about how… What do you think about art now? What do you think the state of art, what do you think about how art is now and where is it going? I just wanna know that. Robert Henke That seems to be a very broad thing, because I have a hard time even defining what art is, so… Audience Member Yeah, well, what about, for example, installation art? Just, let’s, yeah, let’s reduce the topic since we were talking about reducing it. Let’s reduce it and let’s just talk, for example, about installation art. I just meant, for example, well, probably the question is... Oh sorry, my English. Probably a little bit influenced by what I think about art nowadays, but for example, I think that some of the art is just random stuff and some others... Reducing it again, some stuff is very valuable. So I wanna know your opinion about that and, of course, about installation art because you talked a lot about it and of course it is something important in what you do, so I wanna know what you think about that. Robert Henke Well, I guess the whole field of these types of things I’m doing, for me the most difficult question is where do I see myself, or the value of the work I do, in a larger context? So I might take your question as a starting excursion to something that I’m occupying myself a lot with that has to do with the question of where is the art going. When I made electronic music in the early ’90s, it was very clear that this is not commercial. This is underground, which means it doesn’t take much money to do it, there is no large audience, and it has no resonance in a larger scale. Very early then, what happened was that, for instance, with the advent of drum & bass, which I very much liked and still do, suddenly you saw drum & bass on the car commercials. Because this type of more melodic, upbeat music fit very well with this agency vibe of the future. And the same thing happens in an even faster evolution with all this digital media stuff these days. Whatever adventurous, underground idea you can come up with, how to use mapping LED pixels, lasers, video glitch, whatever it is, you are just one centimeter away from the next big agency who is doing exactly the same with the same ideas for Volkswagen, Audi, Tesla, whatever. They appropriate these ideas but with a different approach to it. The approach there, of course, is not, “This has to be meaningful, and this has to be personal,” because that’s not what the interest is. It needs to be impressive. The currency is impressiveness. It’s “Yeah, let’s cover all this building with LED screens and have something amazing, interactive going on.” It’s cool as long as it looks cool, it doesn’t have to have any meaning, it doesn’t have to have any art-historical context or it doesn’t need to point to the future. It just needs to be cool. As someone who is working in this field, sometimes I struggle with this scenario, because on one side I’m this cool, famous person who is one of the co-inventors of Ableton Live. On the other side, I’m running a very, very small scale artistic thing where I solder my LEDs by myself and I’m happy with 8,160 RGB pixels whilst the others have a budget, ten times or 100 times higher to cover the whole room. How do I deal with that? I deal with this by trying to convince myself that the point is not having the most impact, the point is doing something that is personal, because at the end this is why I do art, because I want to express myself. So I don’t know where the general art world is going, and I don’t know who will be the upcoming star of digital media arts and whose LED sculptures will be worth ten million in five years. I’m pretty sure mine won’t, which is fine, but I don’t know about the rest of the development. I guess the whole point is, if you are an artist, at some point you need to free yourself from caring about this too much, because at the end of the day, if you don’t do what you do because you like it and maybe your five best friends, then you are lost anyway. I find it far more important that the people who are really around me can relate to what I’m doing than this big mess. This reminds me to an experience I made a few years ago which I found, in retrospect, very important. After Gerhard stopped making music with me because he had no time anymore, I was in a position where I was very insecure. I was invited to play a show in one of the really big clubs in London, and at this time this still meant a lot to me, and I was really very, very, nervous about that. I thought, “This kind of music which I do is strange anyway,” so I tried to deliver a set that was a little bit more upfront. I had my best intentions. My best intentions was, “It’s a Saturday night, and I need to deliver.” I played the set which was, well, a bit more techno and more mainstream than what I would do usually. The people were dancing and the organizer was happy, so everything was cool. The next day, I read on a message board of a forum I was reading, “I was so incredibly disappointed by the Monolake show yesterday. If I want to hear boring, generic techno I can go anywhere. I wanted to listen to a Monolake show. This was completely bullshit.” I was reading this, and it hit me really right in there. [points to his heart] Because I knew immediately that this person was right. I kind of tried to sell my soul out of insecurity, and probably if I had done just playing back what I would usually do for my friends, maybe not 95% of the drunk people there who wouldn’t care about the music would have been that happy, but these 5% or 10%, or who knows, 30% of the people who deliberately came to see me would have been much, much more happy. That was a big lesson I learned there, and since that time I really try always just to do what I can do best and focus on that, even when I risk sometimes that the majority of the audience might not appreciate it. I mean, it happens sometimes that you are booked to a place and you know beforehand or you know at the moment you arrive that you’re gonna have a tough night here because the promoter obviously didn’t listen to what you’re doing and the audience will not like it. What you do in such a moment is you look out for the five people in the audience you assume who will like it, and you focus on them. The moment you start playing, you look in their eyes, and you smile at them, and you wait for them to smile back at you, and the whole concert you deliver to them. This always works, because they will immediately notice that this is happening for them right now, and then don’t care about everyone else. Even if everyone else afterwards will go away and will not be appreciative of what you’re doing, these five people will come to you at the bar and say, “Thank you, man,” and you’re good. So that’s the thing to take home. Christine Kakaire Any more questions? Audience Member Hey. I had a question regarding Ableton. I guess it kinda concerns the creativity and limitations idea that you were talking about as well. I’m an Ableton user, I have a friend who’s also a producer and he’s a Logic user, and we have constant, endless debates that are really fun, about the differences between those and the different capabilities of each. I was just wondering, what are... ’cause obviously there’s a huge amount that Ableton that can do that other DAWs can’t, and there’s some things other DAWs can do that Ableton can’t. So what are the influences, what makes you kinda make the decision, “We’re going to be able to do this and we’re gonna focus on this and we’re not gonna have...” Is it that you don’t wanna be... Ableton isn’t really concerned with being one particular thing and you have an idea of what exactly you wanted it to be? Is it like that, or is it just...? Robert Henke This is a very, very difficult question. Since the company is now quite matured and old and also reasonably large, there is a lot of people discussing these topics. It’s not this super hierarchical top-down thing. You also learn that you do some marketing research and you talk to people, and you talk to people from different cultural background, from different musical backgrounds, and you try to boil all these external influences and your own ideas into a meaningful guideline of what to do next. So it’s always a mix of listening to your customers, listening to other customers who don’t like your product, that’s equally important, and listening to your own ideas and try to come up with conclusions. At the beginning, the answer was simple. We did something where we had experience in. So we knew how to make a software that works for people who want to make the type of music we like, so the decisions were easy. None of us could read a score, so the idea of implementing musical notation was very far out. That’s the simple, most basic reason why in Live there’s no musical notation. No one has a clue. Nowadays things are, of course, different. But the question is, how many of our users would rely on musical notation and how many other users of us would actually rely on other things which we can improve? There is no shortage of ideas, there’s no shortage of wishes, internally. There’s tons of pages of things which we’d like to do. There’s a severe limitation of, actually, development time. So as a matter of fact, if someone watching this now on YouTube, and you are a C++ developer, and you want to relocate to Berlin and work for a really nice company with a lot of cool people and shaping the music software of the future, write us an email. [laughter] So, commercial end. I’m serious about this. We could do a lot more with more developers, but everyone needs developers so they are really rare, and we compete with companies like Google who can pay a s---load more and offer a lot of things a company even of the size of Ableton can’t. The decision making process these days becomes also more complicated due to the fact that the whole market situation is changing a lot. For 20 years, we could rely on... 20? Almost 20. For almost 20 years, you could rely on the laptop is the thing. Nowadays, you already notice that there’s a whole generation of people who think, “Laptop? That’s the stuff my parents are using. Here’s my iPhone, show me something that I can do with my iPhone.” Every software company, not only music software, but of course also music software, has to face the fact that these things are the stuff the parents are using. So a lot of development resources already have to go into thinking about what products do you offer when the laptop is not hip anymore? This alone takes an enormous amount of resources. You see that in general people who years ago abandoned hardware to do it all on the computer screen are suddenly buying all these little boxes which do cool stuff. So there is another change where people like hardware, and where people expect that hardware is doing a lot of their cool work. Then you have things like mastering services, which means you don’t need to go to a mastering studio anymore. The next step in this thought chain is, perhaps the classical way of mixing tracks is also, at some point, a thing of the past. If an algorithm is better at mixing my tracks, then I don’t need to mix tracks anymore. But maybe, this even would imply the classical idea of tracks is not existing anymore. So you can start thinking in a lot of ways that seem to be completely from a different planet, from a 2018 perspective. But maybe from a 2025 perspective looks like, the way you make music in 2025, if you are state of the art, has nothing to do anymore with this concept of, “This is my bass drum track, this is my hi-hat track.” Who knows? I’m not saying that this will be the case, I’m just saying that this is something to think about now, because if you think about it in five years, it’s too late. So if you think about all these questions, and on top of the question of just making sure the software does all these little improvements which you want to have, the list is endless. People love the comping feature in Logic. Live has no nice comping. It’s something I personally don’t care a lot, but there’s a lot of producers who do classical music production, classical pop production, who really require that feature to happen. So you have to allocate resources to this. Then we have some crazy ideas what we can do in the reality of something more with the session view which is beyond what’s possible now. So there’s all kinds of ideas. Really, the big difficulty is figuring out which of these ideas can realistically be included in an upcoming release. You always have to make a balance between, you need to deliver something that people really want to get their work done. So that’s the bread and butter stuff. If you don’t, if you make a big release and you don’t offer an improvement on the basics, people will be really angry. At the same time, people also expect that they get something that is inspiring. That needs to be something that is not perceived as, “Ugh, finally Ableton has this feature,” but, “Huh, this is interesting.” But if you only do this, then the people will say, “Guys, you don’t even have comping. Why should I care about feature ‘X’?” So you see that the decision making there is a really complicated science, and no one can guarantee that we make the right decisions there, we just try our best to come up with something that at the end of the day makes a lot of users happy. I tend to make long answers to short questions. [laughter] Audience Member Thanks. Christine Kakaire Are there any other questions from our participants? Oh, there’s somebody at the back. Robert Henke Doesn’t matter. Question is a question. Was there a question from you? No. Christine Kakaire Yeah, in the back. Robert Henke Oh, OK. Audience Member Hey. Robert Henke Then I got this gentleman, and then here I think, and then... Audience Member Hopefully a quick one. David, part of the studio team. I follow your Facebook page and the other day I seem to remember you were having a bit of a discussion about design, especially regarding modern plugins and stuff, and in the studios we’re running a lot of the UAD emulations of classic machines, which I think you might’ve had, maybe not issue with, but you had some things to discuss, which I thought if your viewpoint is still the same, might be quite interesting to share with a couple of people. Robert Henke I assume you refer to the discussion I had about the UI of the Synclavier plugin. Audience Member I can’t remember the specific example, but in general... Robert Henke So, because normally I don’t care. As a matter of fact, I think UAD does a fantastic job with... DSP-wise their stuff is insane. If you had asked me a few years ago, I would be a strong opponent against this photorealistic, kind of having hardware in software approach. Nowadays I’m old and mild, and I say, “It sounds great and it looks familiar. I wouldn’t know how else to do it, so I’m fine with that.” The specific case where I was annoyed was if a design tries to provoke the feeling of the real old stuff, and I just happen to love and know the real old stuff inside out, then within the design there is these odd inconsistencies that throw me out of my dream. It’s kind of, you know you’re in a movie... You go in the movie and you want to experience this movie and you’re willing to accept that this is science fiction and you’re in the year 2200, and your willing to accept that everyone can just teleport, it’s all cool. And then there comes a commercial in between and brings you back to, actually, you’re sitting in a cinema watching a movie. And in a way, the specific plugin, to me, felt like this. Everything on the surface felt like, “Yeah, I’m back in the 1980s and I’m operating this vintage machine and I forget that I’m using a plugin,” because it sounds really great. It does. And I’m within this machine, then I go to another page and the design has nothing to do anymore with this old machine. And on top of it, in my personal opinion, and I’m very opinionated about those topics, I’m a pain in the ass inside the company, they did a lousy job. This was what frustrated me and this what caused my rant. Because, I thought in this specific case, there’s probably only one chance for a manufacturer to bring this old classic back to life, because it’s a lot of work to code this, so it was quite some effort. If you have this unique chance to put a historical piece of music technology history into the 21st century and make it accessible to a new generation, you do this once. And if there’s one company has been doing it, it is very, very unlikely that another company will take the same effort to do it again. So, for the rest of the time, all these upcoming generations which will never have the beauty of wasting one kilowatt of electricity for booting a crazy, old tower of electronics, experience this machine, is something, that in my opinion, is not nearly as cool as it could be. And that made me angry. So this is a type of anal focus on detail that sometimes keeps me from making music. But this was a specific moment. There’s other moments, where as I said, I used plugins that looked like that and I even discovered myself smiling at the fact that they look like the hardware. A plugin which also looks ridiculously close to the original hardware is... I think Softube released the Weiss EQ1, which is a fantastic... DS1, the compressor. This is a very expensive mastering compressor, which I used when I was still cutting vinyl records in my past life. And I really like this compressor. It’s totally out of reach financially for normal people, and suddenly there’s a plugin, which looks exactly like the hardware. And in comparison, it’s still out of reach for a lot of people, but it’s in comparison, only 10% of the former out of reach. And there I loved the fact that it looks so much like the old thing. So, there the familiarity affect of, “Ha ha, there’s an LCD screen on a display on a computer screen, which is itself a LCD screen,” kind of was cute. Audience Member Hello. Very nice and spacey, deep and minimal sound you have. Wanted to ask you, how are you able to make it as an artist, making a sound that is niche, because I feel like the whole world is changing because of the type of sound that people are producing now in the mainstream. So how are you able to make it on the underground space? And how does your day in studio look like in terms of making minimal and spacey sounds? Robert Henke OK, this is a few questions so I try to answer them one by another. The question of how I’m capable of doing this. In one way, being there early and having insanely great luck. So, the fact that I was able to make records and the fact that I met people who released my music was just a nice coincidence. It was certainly much easier in the early ’90s because the scene was so small. So, that’s the good luck of having been in Berlin at the right time, and it wouldn’t have happened if I were somewhere else. Unfortunately, a lot of things in life that are really important are just random, both in good ways or in really bad ways and there is nothing you can do, or not much you can do to avoid the one thing and to achieve the other. You can just try to do your best always and see where you end. The other question is easy to answer. My studio life is very limited these days, because due to my... Since I can think, my problem is that I’m interested in too many things. So I made this big fuss about reducing options, and at the same time I feel like I tried to become the da Vinci of my own brand, which knows everything about everything, which is a concept that already in the Middle Ages didn’t work anymore. So I don’t stop working for Ableton because I feel this company is part of my personal history, but also because I really like it. So part of my brain just enjoys thinking about these technical aspects. I make music stilll because when I’m in the studio and I listen to sounds and I’m able to mix them, especially actually when I perform live, I have these moments where I feel severe happiness. Where I think, “Wow, this now is really coming together nicely, and this could go on forever.” And sometimes I have this also when I go somewhere and listen to music. So I need to continue doing this simply because it’s so satisfying. It’s also satisfying to work with my lasers because I’m interested in this, so I also need to do it. If someone would tell me, “OK, you have to decide between you only do Ableton, you only do music, and you only do installations,” I would have a hard time to say what I would do. My first guess is that I could easiest go away without Ableton, but I’m not sure if on a second guessing this would still be true. But to make a decision between I only make music or I only work on my installations, that’s impossible. I have no idea what I would prefer. So, as a result, I try to find a very strict time-management regime where I say, “OK, I need to work on new music. This week I try to not do office work, I try not to do emails. I just go in the studio.” But, unfortunately it rarely works like this. So I need to force myself to spend time in the studio. On a very practical level, what I did is I was reducing the amount of equipment I have, so that I don’t spend too much time thinking about, “Do I use this synthesizer, or this, or this, or do I use that plugin or that?” And I say “OK, If I want something that makes nice string sound, I use this one machine, which I have been using since the mid-’90s to do that, and that’s it.” And I don’t need to buy another synthesizer for the same job. Because instead of thinking about, “This sound is nice, but perhaps this one is better, or that one, ah it’s not connected. Ah, damn it’s not connected. This is channel 17. This is... Ah the cable’s too short.” You know, you spend easy an afternoon to get this one synthesizer to work, and then you figure out at the end that this chord doesn’t need to be in the track at all, instead of making music. I try to have a very strict regime there where I try to focus on things. One work recipe I figured out in the last years which helped me, is that sometimes I’m not really in the mood to make music, but I’m in the mood to create sounds. So I just record sounds. I play with my machine and say “Ah this is an interesting bass sound,” or, “This is a cool percussion sound.” I record this, I give it a nice name and I put it in my sound library. And then when I’m in the mood of making music, I don’t need to spend so much time making sounds. I just think, “Ah I had this great snare with this long reverb tail,” and I just find it and I put it in, and if I have good luck, it’s right there. And then I move on. Part of my strategy to achieve the sound I achieve is by spending a lot of time making sounds and then just using them. And I guess this is pretty much everything I can contribute. Apart from that, there’s always too much reverb on everything. Christine Kakaire Is there anybody else? Oh. You’ve got a mic over there. Audience Member Hey Robert, how you doing, man? Since I’m on the production team here with the Red Bull, the purpose of this is to make these guys better producers. And I asked a couple of the students to ask you this, but they scared. So I’m gonna ask you. By you cutting records and me owning Ryan’s old lathe, I’m sure you’ve seen a lot of these digital productions that’s really smashed out, incorrect levels, I don’t even call it a square wave at the top, I don’t know what it is. It’s a razorback. Can you help them out and explain at what level should they be recording at to get the best outta Ableton? So it sound like what you was just playing. Robert Henke Well, I can not recommend anyone to make something that sounds like my stuff because I’m personally not entirely satisfied with that sound. So, please if you try to record something, make something that sounds significantly better. That’s not fishing for compliments, I find it really painful to listen to my own stuff because I only listen to the mistakes. That’s a personal flaw, which is within me since I exist. And this won’t go away, I’m pretty sure. Anyway, the answer to the question is really difficult. Audience Member Well I want you to kick it with them why the dithering switch is on there for. Robert Henke Sorry. What?. Audience Member Dithering. Dither. Dither. D-I-T-H-E-R. Robert Henke Ah. Well, dithering is, in my opinion... OK, We need to dive deep in here. So, in general, first of all, if you... There’s so many questions, I don’t even know where to start. But I try to find the most essential points. So, basically, as long as you work within something like Live, the idea of maximum level, when the meters turn red, as long as you’re inside Live, is just a convention. And this convention says this is 0dB. Technically, all this inside is floating-point mathematics, which means you put have a signal that is plus 30dB, like would be on the meter, half a meter above your screen, and it’s still a perfectly fine signal. The main point, is as soon as you are leaving your software and you go to a soundcard, you have a hard limit, and this hard limit is exactly the point where the meter turns, in Live, full red. If the meter turns full red, that means that your waveform just hits the maximum and once it would hit this maximum, it stays at this maximum. So if you imagine a nice, low, sine wave bass, boom. It’s just a sine wave decaying. It hits the maximum, so it becomes immediately flat, like if you really cut off the top of if. The main part of that is, what this does sonically is it creates an infinitely small spike in the sound, and this infinitely small spike repeats every time there is this hard edge. So, it’s at the beginning when it clips, and it’s at the end, and then it’s on the other side, and it’s again. These hard edges create additional sounds, which have no harmonic relationship to the original sound. This is just really, really unpleasant distortion. Actually, there is some harmonic relationship, I take the first thing back. But it’s still distortion. So, unlike you really aim for this harshness in your sound, you should avoid that. That’s a very simple rule. So, whenever the meters in life turn red, it’s probably a good idea to go lower. The next interesting question is how low can you go? So, if we agree on that having everything at full level is a bad idea. Then you can say, OK, having all the faders are completely down is also a bad idea, because I don’t hear anything anymore. So, somewhere in between seems to be the truth. The thing with digital is, digital is still a relatively young technology. 20 years ago digital technology was still not nearly as good sounding as it is today, and the rule was always, you try to get as loud as possible without introducing distortion. So you try to basically ride your signal just above what is maximum, because then you had the best headroom, and you had the least noise and all these kinds of things. So this was true until maybe 10 years ago. Nowadays, technology, and especially converter technology, is so good that you can easily have a signal which has much less level, and you still have only very little noise floor. Now this old idea of every signal has to be maximized to get the best signal-to-noise ratio, is not so true anymore. So you can be a little bit more adventurous to what’s leaving more room. But if we come from a theoretical discourse to a practical thing, the one thing that is interesting for making music, when... Let’s assume you have a sound, which has a bass drum, a snare, a hi-hat, and a bassline going on. These sounds are a bit dynamic, so sometimes some of them are louder and sometimes they are less loud. You record them in such a way that none of these sounds exceeds the limit. So everything is below the limit. So if you look at the waveform, there’s a lot of air in between. Then this sound might not sound as powerful as a sound which is put through a compressor, where everything is really squashed, which for a lot of rhythmic music sounds more powerful. But it’s the better material to go to the mastering studio, because this is the old trick with the mastering studio. The effect of the compressor is something you need to have experienced, and you need to listen to with really good speakers in different volumes to really be able to use it in such a way that the product sounds great on a really large system, as well as on a small system. If you don’t have much experience with doing these things, it’s much better just not to do it all, and go to a good mastering place. Or, nowadays, potentially, a clever artificial-intelligence online mastering service. I never tried Landr, but a lot of research went into this. So, I wouldn’t decline the option that this might be better than a person these days. I don’t know, but it’s worth trying probably. Then at the end, having someone who has a lot of experience, either a person, or an algorithm, to do it in a way that has been proven to sound good on many systems. So the last thing is the dither. So, sometimes the more insecure people are, the more they focus on technical details. We have lots of discussions about sound quality in Ableton Live. Everyone in the audio community knows everyone else, so every developer who is working on audio software probably met every other developer on Earth who is doing the same things. This whole myth about different audio engines sounding different, forget about it. Adding two channels in a digital work station is always an addition, like five plus seven. Five plus seven is 13 in Logic, in Cubase, in Nuendo, in every single application everyone writes. So, it’s the same. I know that afterwards when this will be published, there will be endless discussions about this, but it’s still the same. Dithering is a process where... OK, you have 16-bit resolution on a digital analog converter. This mean you have some 65,000 individual steps, as resolution in amplitude. And if you have a very low signal that equals 96 decibel. So you have a very low signal, maybe a sine wave. And you make the sine wave less loud, and less loud, and less loud. So, if maybe the sine wave is at minus 60dB, which is pretty much inaudible in most scenarios. But for the sake of this talk, let’s assume we have a sine wave at this level. And we have a 16-bit converter, then we are 36dBs away from minimum. That means you have six-bit of resolution. So, a minus 60dB sine wave on a 16-bit converter is the same as a full scale sine wave on an eight-bit converter, which is a nice, grungy, 80s sine wave sound, and not a pure sine wave. So, the trick to improve these very, very low sounds is you add a little amount of random noise to it. This sounds like a bad idea in theory, but in the correct theory, it’s a great idea because you can mathematically show that by adding this little noise you distribute the distortion equally, and the overall amount of distortions get less. So, you basically use noise to mask an unpleasant effect. It’s not entirely correct mathematically, but it’s the result in a way. So, what you do is, if you’re recording something on a 16-bit file, you apply dithering at the end, there’s a check box for instance in Live, with different options. Doesn’t matter, in my opinion, because we’re discussing something that no one will ever hear. But if you want to be on the safe side go for triangular. I can spend a few hours on a board explaining why. And it will give you a tiny little bit more of fidelity if you record something that is [whispers into mic_] extremely quiet. Like a hundred times quieter than this. And that’s it. So, in theory if you record an orchestra with enormous dynamic and you have 100 microphones and you need to render individual stems of all of them, applying dithering to each one is a good idea. Practically, you can make an experiment. You can take a bit-rate reduction plugin. You take your most favorite pop song, and you put the plugin at 12-bit. 12-bit is obviously s---. Listen to it. Then close your eyes and randomly turn on and off the plugin a few times. And then close your eyes and listen to it and try if you can listen, if the plugin is on or off. I guarantee you that under a normal listening situation, like here, with normal listening levels, you won’t hear the difference. Because that’s already... 12-bit is six, 12, 36, it’s already in the range of minus 60, minus 70dB. So, even with 12-bit, you are already on the safe side for a nice signal to be above the quantization error. Which means with 16-bit or with 24-bit, you’re way beyond that. People should not think that much about these problems. People should think about is the sound of the bass drum right? Is the decay good? Does the snare and the bass drum sound good together? That’s where you need to spend your creativity and not in levels, as long as not clipping. It’s again a long answer to a short question. I hope there’s not a long question coming, which leads to a potentially longer answer. Was this helpful a little bit? Audience Member Yeah. I just wanna know... Robert Henke Good. Audience Member [question is inaudible] Robert Henke Well, there’s one single thing... One of the producers I admire most is Mark Ernestus, of former Basic Channel and now Rhythm & Sound, and all these amazing things. And I always thought, because this stuff of them, especially the early stuff, is really deep. And you always think, they must use tons of compressors. And I had the chance to work in his studio once and I was surprised because I didn’t find a single compressor in there. I said, “Hey Mark, where are your compressors?” And Mark told me, “I really don’t know how to work with compressors. Nothing here is compressed.” So he’s super about mixing, about spending half a day to decide that this needs to be half a dB louder. And he’s doing a perfect mix, and no compression. And to me this was really a surprise. Because I felt I’m not the only person on the planet who has trouble with compression. Everyone tells you, “Yeah, you need to compress that.” And I try it and it sounds squashed. And then I turn the compressor off and I’m happier again. The only thing where I figured out after years of being the first member of the anti-compression league, [laughter] was that when I perform club stuff live, then having a compressor is sometimes helpful because on a smaller PA you just get more the feeling of intensity. So, my pro tip for performing live is add a compressor at the end of your output signal and have a slider mapped to the threshold. So, the Monolake secret-sauce tip is, set the ratio to one to two, very fast attack, medium-fast decay, and put a fader on the threshold, and map it inversely so that when the fader is all down, this threshold is at 0dB. And when the fader is all up, it’s at minus 25dB. With this strategy... And have make up gain turned on. So, in this scenario, if the fader is all down, your compressor as transparent, and the further you move the fader up, the more compression in your signal you get. And that’s a great thing to play with when you perform club music live. [laughter / applause] Christine Kakaire Anymore short or long questions? From the room. No? Robert Henke Good. We squashed them. Christine Kakaire Here we go. Audience Member Hello, Mr, Henke. Thanks for making my life much easier. Robert Henke Good to know. Audience Member I’m specifically talking about repitch warping. I have here, perhaps an innocent question, I’m just curious where does the word Ableton come from? Robert Henke Good one. That’s the only one. Audience Member I have more, but yeah. Robert Henke So when you found a company, you need a name. Sometimes you have good luck, you have a name that just works like Siemens Group or something like this. Christine Kakaire Or Monolake. Robert Henke Well, that’s a lake and not a name. So, you found a company, and you don’t want to call it the Behles company because it’s kind of childish. And as more people than Gerhard Behles are involved, so anyway. The first thing you do is you think, “Hmm, it’s needs to be a name that describes the product, right? It has to be a name that is something related to sound.” So, I mean we’re talking about early internet. But internet search was already existing. So, you think, “Ah yeah, let’s call it, I make this up, Electronic Wave. electronicwave.com. You Google it, gone. You try any other combination of anything that is sound, wave, pulse. You know, all these kinds of names that in some way seem to be related to what you’re doing. And every possible combination of names is already given. Then you think “OK, let’s be a bit more floral.” You know, you try to come up with some name that is sounding nice like, Onyx, or Rose. Again, I make these things up, but this was the thinking process. So you type in all those names in the search engine. You know, waverose.com. I bet that’s existing. So you gave up on all these names. And then you end up with thinking, “OK, let’s just throw letters together.” So that’s what we did. We just wrote random names on... I remember sitting in the conference room. Really, this is funny. It comes back to my memory. We were sitting here, maybe five people, on a table with pens and paper, and we just randomly scribbled some names. And one of those Ableton. And there was even a question if it has an ‘e’ or not. And it was really just... I don’t even know who came up with this name. We had tons of names on the list and we put them all on the wall and we looked at them. So, the funny thing about Ableton was that I said, “I like this because it sounds slightly like a British high-end manufacturer. [speaks in British accent] Oh, wow, this is an Ableton L15, nice.” So, I liked this. And then there was a question if there should be an ‘e’, like tone, you know. Able to produce a tone, Abletone. And then someone said, “Ah, the ‘e’, Abletone, nah. I mean Ableton is good, yeah. Tone is German for... Tone is a German company... Ton. Ableton. Able, ability, that’s kind of nice, yeah. Ableton. Hmm, Ableton. Let’s think about it. What do you think about Ableton? Ableton. Ableton. Ableton. Ableton. Sounds like s--- in German. Ableton. Ableton. I like it. Yeah it grows on me. Ableton. Ableton. Let’s write it down. How does it look when it’s written down. Make it all capitals. No.” I guess is when every company tries to come up with a name. Long story short, Ableton. So. [laughter / applause] And, of course, www.ableton.com. Website now available. “Yeah! It’s free, it’s free. Register.” Christine Kakaire Anybody else? Robert Henke I think we need to stop now anyway because I believe I’m way over my schedule with a lot of other stuff which was... Christine Kakaire OK, OK. Well, let’s Robert get back to his studio. Thank you, once again. Robert Henke No, no. I have more stuff here. Christine Kakaire Oh here. Oh yes, the radio. Yes, yes radio. Thank you again for being here.

Titica
Titica is one of the biggest stars of kuduro, a music and dance style native to Angola and the Angolan diaspora in Portugal that is a collision of trans-Atlantic sounds: techno, soca, zouk, hip-hop, house. Raised in Luanda, Angola’s capital city, the artist born Teca Miguel Garcia cut her teeth as a dancer, before translating that passion to MCing within the sparky style of kuduro. The sound came to global attention in the late ’00s, via artists such as Don Omar, Buraka Som Sistema, M.I.A. and Diplo. In the early aughts, a streak of hit singles such as “Chão Chão” and “Olha o Boneco” brought Titica to the fore of the kuduro scene. She became a national celebrity, and even performed for the former Angolan President, Jose Eduardo do Santos. In 2013, she was also appointed National Goodwill Ambassador by UNAIDS to help raise awareness around HIV prevention and treatment, especially among young people in Angola.
In her lecture at Red Bull Music Academy Berlin 2018, Titica discussed the history and evolution of kuduro, her experience as a transgender woman in music and collaborating with artists from around the world.
Hosted by Anupa Mistry So, as fans and makers and thinkers on music, I think we have to acknowledge the way that sound, across time and around the world, has penetrated the human body. These are very blessed times, I think, for music but also for dance. And rhythm and movement and the ecstasy of physical expression, is a crucial part of what our next guest gives to the world. So please welcome from Luanda, Angola, the queen of kuduro, Titica. Titica Hi! Hi, guys! Anupa Mistry Also, just for people who are watching at home we are working with a simultaneous interpreter here for this lecture, so you may notice a little bit of a delay to allow for the relay of information. Bem-vinda! Titica Thank you. I’m Titica, an Angolan singer. A trans singer from Africa. Anupa Mistry So I think it would be nice to begin with an introduction to kuduro and to your music. So let’s play the first video. This came out in 2011 and it is your hit single “Chão.” (music: Titica – “Chão” / applause) So, that was Titica’s video for “Chão.” You’re laughing and smiling while that video was playing. What memories were you thinking of? Titica It’s true! Anupa Mistry Hopefully that gives everyone in the room a bit of kuduro’s pulse. Titica, how would you define kuduro? Because it’s not just music. It’s also dance. Titica The translators. Anupa Mistry Try now. Titica I can hear now. Anupa Mistry So, how would you define kuduro? Because it’s not just music, it’s dance as well. Titica I define kuduro as dance, joy. It is a style. It depicts our reality in the ghetto. Kuduro used to be highly marginalized. And we broke this taboo. Why was it marginalized? Because lots of those involved with kuduro had delinquency issues and led a bad life. Then they had to find a way to survive. It represents how this kuduro represents freedom of expression. People were discriminated against because of what they looked like. People were discriminated against: big earrings, the hair, impressive clothes. Kuduro was made taboo to some people. Thank God we are changing this. Kuduro is dance, kuduro is joy. It depicts our reality in the outskirts. Anupa Mistry What are some of the key musical elements of kuduro? Titica The key musical elements of kuduro... Kuduro has sugar in it. Semba is also an important element. As well as the beats and influences from Congo. Anupa Mistry So soca and semba and the beats from... Titica Semba. Semba. Semba. Titica Before kuduro. Sorry? It found its origins in semba. Eduardo Paím was the first to sing kuduro.
He has been one of the zouk giants and also a major influencer. Then we also have Tony Amado and Sebem. They were the kings of kuduro. And that is still true today. Anupa Mistry Why was dance so crucial to popularizing the sound with the people? Titica The dance is very important. Kuduro without dance is no kuduro. Then you need to come up with moves and the responsibility of coming up with moves both for women and men. Kuduro requires an attitude. And the dance must be above all different, more exotic and feminine. But also masculine for the two of them. And there is no kuduro without dance. Anupa Mistry You got your start with kuduro as a backup dancer, working with other artists. Can you tell us about that experience? Titica I was a ballet dancer before I started singing. Traditional ballet dancer. I was a big fan of Própria Lixa. I was a traditional dancer. And then Fofandó started singing. One of the greatest contributors to kuduro’s female singers. I followed Própria Lixa and we were friends for three years. After that I was one of Própria Lixa’s ballet dancers. May God rest her soul. She is no longer among the living. I danced for them for three years. People started liking me. I won them over. Dance brought me fame, because of the acclaimed singers. I danced for them. The show was live and this made me nervous. Alicia and Noite & Dia are renowned singers. They’re queens of kuduro and I danced for them for a long time. And that is how people got to know me. Anupa Mistry So, we’ll get a little bit into your shift to becoming the queen of kuduro,
yourself in a bit. But I also want to provide just a little bit more kuduro context. The music kind of emerged in the ’80s amidst the Angolan Civil War, which lasted almost 30 years from 1975 to 2002. Can you tell us why this music became kind of the folk sound of the people? Titica Because during the war we did not have recreational opportunities. Our fun, joy and expression portrayed our society, what we experienced through music – through kuduro. The Angolan people is a happy one. Angolans love music. We love to lead a good life. Those were very, very sad times in the country. And the only way to have some fun was through our music. It showed us our reality. It was about how supportive and good our country is, how it helps us face the hurdles. Anupa Mistry There are other sounds and rhythms that are also kind of indigenous to Angola, such as semba and kizomba. These are sounds that kind of move at a slower tempo than what we heard here. Why do Angolans, or maybe even young people, I think, identify more strongly with kuduro? And maybe can you talk a bit about how kuduro is perceived against sounds like semba and kizomba? Titica For Angolans, kuduro has a stronger dance connotation. Through dance and rhythm Kuduro is better able to portray our reality. In Kuduro, we have freedom of expression. Kuduro has sugar, kuduro has salt. That’s why, when many of us sing abroad, even when people do not understand the language, they are joyful and dance with us. It’s the beat of kuduro. Anupa Mistry What’s the perception of kuduro versus other sounds that popular in Angola, like semba or kizomba? Titica We have semba, kizomba, kilapanga, cabecinha, a style common to several religions present in our country. Congo has its style. Not Congo. Uíge has its style. Catete has its style and so does Luanda. There are several music styles in Angola. In Luanda, no here I meant to say Angola. Anupa Mistry OK. So let’s move a little bit into how you started making music. What did you grow up listening to? Titica When I was younger, I used to listen to music. I have a Congolese background. I listened to lots of music from Congo. Pépé Kallé [and] Koffi Olomide, who inspired me a lot. I mix kuduro with some elements from Kallé, and some of N’dombolo. This is Congo’s style. Anupa Mistry Had you always been interested in making music yourself? When we talked a bit about you being a dancer, so…? Titica No. No. No. No. I’d never been interested in music. I was a dancer. How does art get into my life? When I was small, I used to dance at parties. I also used to dance during school celebrations. I danced freestyle in the streets. I filled the streets. When my mother saw I was in the circle dancing she thought they were beating me up. She would get me out of the circle and spank me, but it was only art. As for dancing, I used to perform in schools, at parties. I always made a good impression. All because of my dancing. One day I joined a dance group and then I met Noite & Dia, Fofandó. I befriended them and asked to dance for them. I started dancing and became well known, at home and abroad. Anupa Mistry How did your experience as a backup dancer teach you how to be a performer? It’s not easy to go from behind the star to being the star. Titica I always learned from other people’s mistakes. Thank God, I was able to able to focus. When I started singing, I always had clear goals. I learned how to be disciplined, to have a more professional approach, and to be on time. I learned a lot from the singers I danced for. I think I am still trying to do my best and bringing joy to the world with my art. Anupa Mistry When did you actually start recording your own music then? Titica I started recording my own music six years ago. One day I went to see DJ Devictor, who’s my current producer. I was in a recording session with Noite & Dia. She was having difficulties with the chorus. Being their dancer, I could offer them some tips concerning dances and beats from Congo for them to sing, but she could not record and I did. Behind her back, the DJ asked me if I had ever thought about singing. I tried it before but wasn’t successful. And then the singers will be talking about it. Jealousy always plays a role. The following day I went to Devictor’s studio. That was a hit. I recorded “Afrike Moto” with Tuga Agressiva. And then I recorded “Chão” and this track catapulted me forward and back then I had no idea it’d be so popular at home and abroad. I could not image I’d be sitting in this studio today recording this show for Red Bull. Only God can explain this. Anupa Mistry So, how soon after you started making music did you have a hit single? How long did it take? Titica One year, after one successful year. I released my first album Chão. Anupa Mistry Are there a lot of women who make kuduro music? Titica Yes, there are. One of the most important female artists in the kuduro scene was Fofandó, who is the queen of kuduro. You hear around the world, in Brazil they say that I’m the queen of kuduro, but kuduro has a queen who inspired us and I looked up to. They call me queen because of my life story and how I attained recognition living in Africa. Fofandó was one of the driving forces behind kuduro. In kuduro you find a lot of female voices in Angola. Anupa Mistry OK. So we should play another video. This is “Olha o Boneco.” Please excuse my Portuguese. Titica That was “Olha o Boneco” featuring Ary. One of the greatest divas of the Angolan music. She was my patron and supported me when I started singing. Anupa Mistry So this is video number two, please. (music: Titica feat. Ary – “Olha o Boneco” / applause) Anupa Mistry So that was Titica’s video for “Olha o Boneco” featuring Ary. That was a big video for you. What happened after that video came out? Titica Very big indeed. It was a big video. Ary was one of the biggest driving forces,
my patron. She’s my best friend and today I’m her son’s godmother. My first big hit was “Chão.” After this song, many became my fans. One of the greatest singers that we have in Angola is Ary, also known as the diva of the people, because she loves the people and the land. She has brought changes to my life. After “Olha o Boneco,” I was present on many stages. Anupa Mistry That video and that track also had a big international impact. Didn’t it? Titica It sure did. There was big international impact. I could participate in Cora, with this song “Olha o Boneco.” It was great. And I am happy. Anupa Mistry Part of your story and I think part of the narrative that this video kind of fueled internationally, is the fact that you are transgender. Angola is a Catholic country and a former Portuguese colony and so laws discriminating against LGBT people are a part of this legacy. What is the status of LGBT rights in Angola today? Titica Thank God, I’m more respected today. But in the past I was pelted with stones. I was not allowed into certain places. But since a “no” to me always meant “yes,” I have always been a hard worker. And I’ve never offended anyone. Thank God my dance performances could engage the children. I was welcomed into their homes or into someone’s life because of the kids. On their birthdays, for their celebration, the kids would drive their parents crazy if I did not sing on their birthday. There would be no party. If I sold a CD, all the kids would buy one. Or else they’d be tough on their parents. That is why I’m very careful when I write my songs. As for prejudice in Africa, things have changed a lot. Because we could... I, Titica, I could change the mentality of many people in Angola, with my music, with my art. I could show that being different is only because we look different when you only see the front, that what matters is the love and not what you look like. Each one does his best and when we are born we don’t choose our relatives. What matters is the love. Then I had my music to give. I never offended anyone. I always overcame my hurdles. Thank God, my young fans have contributed to me being Titica. I have also been able to change the mentality of the Angolan and the African people. Thank God, I was awarded the prize of the most respected trans in Africa. Anupa Mistry You also became a UNAIDS ambassador and this song I think kind of helped
bring a lot of international attention to your story. How has the attitudes of international attention kind of changed the way people feel about you within Angola? Titica It was a very big change. From there people started to see the difference. They do not link my sexuality to my work. I’ve always struggled for people to differentiate my sexuality from my work. The singer Titica is the singer. My sexual option is how I live. It has to do with me and not with anyone else and it was a major step in my life because we, musicians, are opinion-formers. We are trendsetters. Our clothes become fashionable. So why not to act in solidarity and to offer advice to our brothers and fans. Tell them about the importance of using condoms
in order to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. Singers have a lot of followers and we have to set an example in our country and in our art. We have to be extremely careful when writing our songs because a lot of people look up to us and good actions are needed. Anupa Mistry Great! Let’s listen to another track. That song [“Olha o Boneco”] came out in 2012. It is 2018 now. Titica’s been hard at work. And I think we want to kind of give everyone a sense of what she’s been doing in the meantime. So, this is a track called “Makongo” featuring Paulo Flores. (music: Titica feat. Paulo Flores – “Makongo” / applause) So, that was a track called “Makongo” featuring Paulo Flores. You put that out in 2014, but it’s actually on your newest album, which came out this year, called De Última à Primeira. I think I said that right? Titica No. Anupa Mistry Oh, I didn’t say it right? Titica It’s part of the second album, not the newest album. Anupa Mistry OK. I’m sorry. Titica The second album was called De Última à Primeira. “Makongo” means “problem.”
He fell in love with a woman who was not a woman. She was a trans woman. Paulo Flores is one of the biggest monsters. He is the king of semba. He’s released several CDs and has many hits. He decided to sing with me after a case of bullying on Facebook. He saw a lot of offenses. People were speaking ill of me [and there was] prejudice against the LGBT community. And one day we met in Portugal. I invited him to sing with me and he agreed to sing with me. To participate in a song called “Makongo” “problem.” It is a story, a man who falls in love with a trans woman and that was also a form of assertion, a fight against prejudice in Angola. Being different is not a sin, it’s just being different. Anupa Mistry It’s also interesting that you were sending that message on a track that sounds very different from what we’ve heard here. You’re working in a new style. Can you tell us a bit about semba music and learning how to work in a different style? Titica It was very difficult. As a matter of fact I didn’t intend to, because I identify more with kuduro. That’s where my strength is. I had always aimed at a career and not at fame. I want to be an all-round artist. And I am also very bold and daring and decided to plunge into different waters. “Makongo” featuring Paulo Flores was my first semba. My first tarraxinha song featuring C4 [was] “Ta Bem Bom,” [which] is my third track. My first semba, which I recorded with Paulo Flores, was awarded the title of best semba in 2015 by Top Rádio Luanda. And I decided the game must go on. Being bold enough to plunge into different waters. I like being a versatile singer. Anupa Mistry Can you tell us a bit about semba music? How is it different from kuduro? We can hear it, but... Titica Semba is the traditional rhythm of our predecessors: Elias Diá Kimuezo, Tino Diá Kimuezo. It’s a very respected style. Singing this song is a lot of responsibility. And I don’t have a lot to explain about semba because it is not my forte. I learned about it. I joined the music school to do my best when singing. I know of course this style from our forefathers. And I know this style enjoys a lot of respect in Angola and elsewhere. Anupa Mistry Let’s give some more context to the sound that you’ve moved towards. I wanted to play a couple of tracks by some other pop artists from other countries in Africa, neighboring countries, that you really enjoy. So, one of the first tracks is by Congolese artist named Fally Ipupa and it’s called “Droit Chemin.” (music: Fally Ipupa – “Droit Chemin” / applause) Titica Fally Ipupa. Anupa Mistry That was a track by Fally Ipupa called “Droit Chemin.” Can you tell us about that song? Titica I will tell you a little about the singer. Fally Ipupa is a Congolese singer. I listened to Congolese music when growing up. I have a Congolese background. My dad is from Congo and my mom is from Uíge, Angola. I am of Bacongo origin. I grew up with this kind of music. And when I met Fally Ipupa, I saw that he had also been a dancer, with a very similar story to mine. He is renowned at home and abroad. I am a very big fan. He is an accomplished singer and songwriter. He’s a great dancer and singer. I identify with him. I like to hear him singing. I like to watch him dancing. I attained recognition through my dance. He inspires me. And he takes Africa’s name across borders. He is very well-known in Congo, in France in the US and not only there. Then, there is nothing better than to mirror in positive things. And he is taking Africa and Congo beyond our borders and that is very inspiring. I like him as a singer. Anupa Mistry That is a style of music called soukous. Am I correct? Or no? Titica Soukous is a music style I really identify with. If you listen to my song, there is some influence from soukous. For instance, [speaks unintelligible French]. I find a lot of inspiration in the Congolese music, in the sounds of Congo. Anupa Mistry Can you tell us a bit about some of the elements that make up soukous? Titica The elements that make up soukous are drums, guitar, solos. It’s more drums, bass, and guitars, and swing. Anupa Mistry We’ll play another song that is also kind of reflected in your growth as a kind of a complete artist and is something that has inspired you as well. This is a completely different tempo. It’s a track by Nelson Freitas and C4. Nelson Freitas is from Cape Verde. And this is a track called “Bo Tem Mel.” (music: Nelson Freitas feat. C4 – “Bo Tem Mel” / applause) Anupa Mistry So, that was a track by Nelson Freitas and C4 called “Bo Tem Mel.” That song was very popular, I’ve been told. It was very popular. Can you tell us a bit about it? Titica It is a popular music. It’s empowering to women. I see myself in it. I must have some MEL (honey). I really think I have honey, I’m so sweet. I like this song a lot. I grew up listening to Nelson Freitas. They were four siblings or cousins, if I’m not mistaken. The family sings so well. I’m also a big fan. And I love this song because I can identify with it. Because I also have honey. Anupa Mistry That’s a style of music that comes from zouk. Can you tell us a bit about zouk? Titica Zouk is a Cape Verdean style. Zouk came to Angola with the Cape Verdean community. They’ve influenced us. It also been influenced by people from the Antilles, the islands. Other major influencers are the Kassav’. They’ve had a big influence on zouk, in Angola, Cape Verde and on some islands. I like it so much that I have also recorded songs in the zouk style. Anupa Mistry Yes. I wanted to kind of pull all of these different tracks together to kind of bring to this point of where you are at now in your career. You are reaching out and trying lots of different sounds. Can you talk a little bit about your goals in building a career outside of Luanda? You’ve already reached, you know Portugal and Brazil. But can you talk a bit about how different styles of music are part of that journey? Titica That’s what I said at the beginning. I’ve always wanted to make a career and not fame. And I’ve always loved music. I carry music in my heart. I take music very seriously. I identify a lot with kuduro. It has a lot to do with my personality. It’s the style that has brought me the most international exposure. And it is a style I will always be with me. As I said, I want to make a career and not fame. I decided to join a music school. I hang out with the big names of the Angolan music scene. I learned how to sing and work on my career. Music is art. We should explore new waters. What matters is that we can assert ourselves through music and to convey to our fans and our followers what you want to give to them. And that is what I like doing. But my fans love it when I sing kuduro because it’s the style that I most identify with and I am more aggressive. But as time passes, I will get used to mixing more and to reggae. I don’t know about R&B. It isn’t on my mind to do more electronic stuff with singing and all because kuduro is more text and people take it seriously. If you hear the Nadja style sung by Davido and Skid. You will hear some melodies. That is why I decided to improve my voice. Anupa Mistry So, that actually is a perfect jumping off point for the next video that I want to play, which kind of illustrates a bit of the sonic exchange that’s happening across the Atlantic. You hear music from Africa going across to America, the Caribbean, things happening over there and coming back across the ocean and being remixed and reworked again. And I think one of your newest tracks really highlights this exchange and also your growth as an artist and your incorporation of lots of different influences. So, can we please play Titica’s video for “Reza Madame”? It’s video number one. (music: Titica – “Reza Madame” / applause) Titica “Reza Madame” Anupa Mistry That is the video for “Reza Madame.” That’s an amazing song. That bassline feels like a rap song. Can you hear the Brazilian drum? But it’s still a kuduro song. Can you tell us about making that song, and I think kind of how kuduro has transformed itself from where you started to now? Titica Kuduro has changed a lot. Look at how its beats and other sounds have developed. Kuduro also has its influence. Nowadays, you can sing rap in the kuduro beat, you can sing kuduro using the rap beat. Then kuduro and hip-hop also have common points, for instance, the use of beef. The beef can be seen in the beats. It is also present when you convey your standing: I am a queen. “Reza Madame” is the picture warning the other kuduro female singers that they should pray because I have come out with a song that is going to take hold of Angola and the world. Ladies, do pray. It is being assertive and to show them that I am the queen in my field and also to show them that I am competent in what I do. There are other rap influences of the American music. You can see I have also found inspiration in Nicki Minaj and other singers such as Cardi B. They are big influencers in my music. A mix of Africa and America also helps with the sales. Anupa Mistry Yes. I also find what you are doing vocally very interesting, like with your melodies. Can you tell me a bit about that? Titica It is a way to develop my career and my music. I learned a lot [by looking at] what American influencers are doing in term of images. I like Nicki Minaj’s body, her Barbie face. Perfect characteristics. I really like it. And thank God, it’s a big responsibility because I linked my image to my music. In Angola I am a trendsetter. If I have long hair, red or yellow, this will become fashionable. If my lipstick is pink, this will become fashionable. In the streets, vendors were calling out, “Come and buy Titica’s lipstick. Come buy Titica’s trousers.” This is great. Anupa Mistry How popular is kuduro kind of within the Afro pop, Afro beats realm? We hear a lot about Wizkid and Mr. Eazi and these other really popular West African artists, but where does kuduro sit within that world? Titica Angola’s style kuduro is on a good path. It is also known around the globe. But it is easier for Nigerian singers because of the language. They speak English and have a better reception in the world. English is one of the most influential languages in the worlds, right? Then, Wizkid, Davido, Mr. Eazi are great singers to find inspiration in and see they are Africans and made it. OK, they have English in their favor. This means that we Angolans, despite the fact that we speak Portuguese, Swahili or other languages, can also get there. There are many countries in the world that don’t understand English. And yet, American music is present there. I say American music because it’s one of the most widely heard styles of music in the world. That is why I, Titica, give this example. I find inspirations of those Nigerian singers such as Mr. Eazi. I dream of reaching their level and to singe with them. Bringing kuduro and Afro beat together would be great. Anupa Mistry Can you talk a bit about kuduro’s popularity in other Portuguese speaking countries? I mean specifically Brazil. Titica Kuduro is played a lot in Brazil, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. It is a good thing and it makes me very happy to see the recognition of our art, our music and our kuduro. Many kuduro singers come from underprivileged areas. They are real fighters. They have suffered from racial prejudice, in my specific case, gender prejudice. I am happy that I can make this contribution. As for Brazil, it has given me a very warm welcome. I’m very well-known over there. And I talk to everybody. Nowadays in the streets of Brazil, they ask to take a picture with me. This makes me happy for being famous and for being here, as well. God, this is a great responsibility but God only knows where I am heading. Anupa Mistry Where is it leading? Titica What I said before is that I want to build a career and make a name for myself, Titica. You can see me here and you will see me climbing up the ladder. Anupa Mistry Can you talk a bit about your work in Brazil then? You have collaborated with some major Brazilian artists. Pabllo Vittar, Baiana System, and you played at Rock in Rio, which is one of the biggest music festivals on earth. So, are there challenges to building a career in Brazil specifically or have you found that path to be quite straightforward? Titica No, it wasn’t easy. Brazil has always been a country I could identify with. When I was younger in Angola, we watched a lot of Brazilian soap operas. And when I was younger, my first dream was to set foot in Brazil. And I always watched Tieta and other great Brazilian soap operas. One day I know I would be in Brazil but I could not imagine that I would be invited to Brazilian shows. I had never thought that I could be hanging out with the famous people in Brazil. But I had always dreamed to going to Brazil. I could always identify with Brazil. And then I was invited to participate in Rock and Rio. It’s hard to explain. It was a godsend and God knows why. And through my art, my life story, despite having experienced a lot of prejudice, I could overcome everything in Angola and be a respected person in Angola. They’ve decided to support me. And in this case I could assert myself, show my face. I was different though my music. I could sing a duet with Baiana System. It was a big opportunities they gave to me. Thanks to them I could participate in the most interesting festival in the world. Rock and Rio was positive for my career and brought me more respect in my own country and elsewhere. Thanks to this exposure across the country, people in Brazil love me. And there is Pabllo Vittar, a drag queen who shares this fight with me against homophobia and issues concerning the LGBT community. I decided to duet with him. We’re in the fight together against racial prejudice and against gender prejudice. And I am very happy with my career. It’s all I had dreamed of. My career is progressing. I’ve never been so serious about something. I’d never dreamed I’d become well known at home and abroad. I thank the Brazilian people for loving me and for such a warm welcome. Anupa Mistry I think that’s a great place to kind of end our conversation. And I’m hoping that you guys will be able to add some more. So, before we get to that, let’s give a big thank you to Titica. Thank you! Titica Thank you, thank you! I’m so sorry, I don’t speak English... It’s not good, but I promise, I do promise to learn English to entertain you better. I thank you for the opportunity. My thanks also go to Freak de l’Afrique, to Red Bull for giving us, Africans, this opportunity to take our music beyond our borders. Anupa Mistry Agreed. Audience Member Hi, are you fine? Titica Yes. Audience Member I’m from Brazil. Please tell us about how you first met Pabllo Vittar, such a famous person. Titica Pabllo Vittar? Audience Member Yes, Pabllo. Titica I started following Pabllo Vittar through a friend of mine, the singer Telma Lee. Knowing that I am a respected trans person in Angola she said, “Look, there is a gay person in Brazil who sang with Anitta and she is top. Follow her.” I followed Pabllo Vittar and I liked her, a drag queen with an attitude. A confident drag queen and also I saw myself in her. She struggled a lot at the beginning but was well accepted. I knew she was a fighter. Our story is very similar. One day I was invited to participate in Rock and Rio. She is so popular in Brazil. She also participated in it. She saw me in the Fátima Bernardes show and we started sounding each other out. Then there was an article about me in the newspaper Extra, one of the most widely read newspapers in Brazil, where it was mentioned that I had a dream of singing with Pabllo Vittar. She read this article, started following me, and I followed her and sent her a message. We’ve gotten in touch and have been friends until today. Audience Member That’s really cool. Titica I speak very fast, isn’t it? Anupa Mistry They all speak Portuguese. Audience Member Hi. I’m from Portugal. Titica Ah, Portugal. Audience Member Thank you for the words. I think the situation for artists in Angola at the moment is not very good. What were some of the difficulties you had to face along the way? Or would you say you had some privileges? Titica No, there were no privileges along the way. I heard “no” many times. I faced lots of prejudice and there were so many struggles. I’ve always been someone to grab the opportunities in my life
I’ve always grabbed the opportunities such as making friends, meeting people. Thank God, I met a lot of good people in my life. From the beginning of my career onwards, I was lucky enough to be heard around the globe. If you check out my YouTube videos, you will see a lot of comments made by Brazilians, something I only realized some time ago. There are also comments from Portugal, Germany, Switzerland and Russia. I am a privileged person, thank God, but not everything came on a platter. There is a lot of hard work behind it, especially as a trans person. Before I could get respect, I was pelted with stones. I already slept in the streets at night. I’ve been through a lot in my life. Audience Member I also speak Portuguese, but I will ask my question in English so that everybody here can understand it. Thank you for being here. I’m very happy to have the opportunity to see an artist like you sitting there. I come from Chile. My mother is Brazilian and that’s why I speak Portuguese. So, now I am going to do the question in English so you can... I really liked that you talked about Brazilian soap operas like Tieta. I wanted to say this in English because in Latin America, soap operas that are from Brazil are quite a thing there. They are huge. Everyone watches them and everyone are into them, yeah, and they play that all over the world. So my question about Tieta, for example, I don’t know if, in Luanda, they played Xica da Silva, which was another huge soap opera. So, what I wanted to ask is, what do you think about this... It actually has to do a lot with all the slavery and historical process. So, what do you think about that imaginary? And also, since we are talking about visual aspects, what do you thing about, for example, black artists like Nicki Minaj or other female black artists that are huge now and have like a huge influence on black artists now like you, for example? What do you think about that and how do you think you relate to that? Titica My work reflects all of this. You mentioned Xica da Silva. I loved this soap opera and am a big fan of Taís Araújo. I had never dreamed of participating in Mister Brau, in the same series. Thank God, I’m a blessed girl. Mister Brau is a series aired by Globo with Taís Araújo and then I saw the scenes with Zé Maria. There was a lot of prejudice in my childhood years.
They used to call me Zé Maria. Zé Maria was Taís Araújo’s best friend. He was gay and when I was younger they used to call me Zé Maria because I was always hiding. I’m happy to see great black female artists having success in the world. I can mention Nicki Minaj, Kelly Rowland and Beyoncé, etc. This show that the world is changing. We are being respected and experience neighborly love and mutual respect. And life goes on. I promise to work hard and, with God’s help, reach their level. OK. Anupa Mistry Let’s get some more questions. Titica Please feel free to ask lots of questions. Anupa Mistry We have interpreters, so don’t be shy. They’re back there. Audience Member Hi there. I’m David, part of the studio team and I saw you perform on Saturday, which was really cool. I wanted to ask about the kuduro scene in Portugal. I’m from London and the music they made in Portugal has become very popular in the sort of club scene in London in the last few years. I don’t know if you know the label. How would you say, “Príncipe”? “Príncipe,” something like that. I was just wondering if there is any sort of dialog happening between these artists in Portugal. It’s mainly instrumental music being made in Portugal that I am hearing. And if any of the productions are... If there is any communication between some artists in Angola and the Portuguese scene? Titica At the beginning of my singing career, when I released the tracks “Chão” and “Olha o Boneco” in 2011 and 2012, the tracks were widely played in Portuguese discos. There is a lot of Angolan and African music in Portugal. But the most widely played music styles that really fill up the dance floors in Portugal are zouk and kizomba. They are more popular in Portugal when compared to kuduro. Thank God, I am well known in Portugal. They play my songs but not as much as they play C4. Matias Damásio and Anselmo Ralph. They are the most famous Angolan musicians. It’s up to me to work even harder to be on a par with my colleagues. I promise to make it there. Thank God Portugal has showed a good reception to my new track featuring Pabllo Vittar, “Come e Baza.” I will keep working hard because I don’t want to let down my fans. Audience Member First of all, I just want to say that your performance on Saturday was amazing. This is a two-part question. The first question is, the first song we heard, “Chão,” what are you saying in that song? What are the lyrics? Titica Chão, chão is a dance and it is rupture. When I say rupture is because in kuduro there is the “assertiveness.” What I say with the dance chão is that I will bring itching to many of you out there, I am a truck and will break you all, female kuduro singers, and show no mercy. It’s a dance and I ask everyone to get down on the floor (chão) by saying chão [six times] and then up (cima) [four times]. It’s a dance. I want to thank you for having enjoying the show. You know, it’s a lot of responsibility to represent kuduro. Especially when many of you don’t understand the language. I was worried how to entertain you. Thankfully, kuduro is like this. The public enjoyed my charisma and my performance and this made me very happy. What really matters is that people like it and not the fee. The fee is also relevant but much more important and that I bring joy through my music. That makes me feel good. Audience Member My second part of that questions is, I see in a lot of African dance music that the lyrics – and I mean dance music in general – the lyrics are talking about the dance moves or encouraging people who are on the floor to like, you know get down, get up, go crazy, etc. But I was wondering if in kuduro there are also songs that address the politics in Angola or some more like deep, serious themes, or if most of the lyrics are about dance moves and partying. Titica Rappers talk more about politics. Kuduro has a few songs that address politics, but kuduro depicts our reality. We have the following categories: Kuduro lamento (lamentation), kuduro rompimento (rupture), kuduro dança (dance). We have a little bit of other themes, but that’s more common with rappers, who have more freedom of expression. So, yes, kuduro does have this topic, it is not as visible as the choreographer. Audience Member Thank you. Titica There are songs about communicable diseases, recommending people to use condoms. Yes, there are several songs with positive messages. Audience Member Hi! Titica Hi! Audience Member It’s so nice to see you here. Titica Hi! Audience Member I am just curious. You say you tell about condom usage and safe sex in your songs, right? Titica I have a song that says, “AIDS no.” It’s a track in my first CD. I decided to contribute with my voice. We singers are opinion formers. We have to reeducate our fans. Not only by giving them dance, but also with constructive songs. Audience Member That’s cool. Titica Thank you! Audience Member Hi. You talk a lot about the importance of dance in kuduro. And I was wondering, you said earlier that you make a specific dance move for the song. You make one for the men and one for the women. And I was wondering, when you’re making the song in the studio,
does the dance start to enter in there? Do you make the song and then you’re like, “We make the dance now,” or does it all happen kind of together as part of the one creative experience? Titica It’s all a harmony. But first of all we have to settle for the chorus. Because the chorus is the foundation, the refrain, the refrain leads the song. The rest is less relevant. The chorus and the moves have to be practical and not very difficult. The dance should include moves for the young and the old, for women and for men. My producer’s very careful when it comes to that. After talking to him, he already sent me back home many times because the chorus was not convincing. The choruses that convinced him have become hits. I have these examples of easy choruses.
[sings examples of easy choruses]. They are songs for men and women and I am careful enough about this. Audience Member Hello! Titica Hello! Audience Member You mentioned being fans of some American artists like Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé. I was wondering if you had plans to collaborate with any artist from the States? And, if so, which American artist would you like to collaborate with? Titica I am about to faint! It already occurred to me to set foot on the same stage with them and this has already happened. Beyoncé participated in Rock in Rio, Brazil, in 2015. I was there in 2017. So, those were different years. And nothing is impossible. Dreaming is not forbidden. There are many Angolan artists in the field of fashion. Maria Borges is such an example. She is from Angola and she always meets those great singers and stars from the US. She is also someone I look up to and she gives me the courage to continue singing. Maybe to duet with Nicki Minaj. Beyoncé‘s voice is a bit too much for me. She’s an excellent singer. But I will be singing within my comfort zone. Nicki Minaj has a lot to do with me. The way she sings, the way she dances, her performance. Everything is very inspiring. I can’t bring myself to wear all those wigs, though. There are many things she wears that I cannot imagine myself in. But I love her performance and the fact that she likes to play the black Barbie and so do I. I love it. She is a black Barbie and a good inspiration, Nicki Minaj. For me in kuduro when I ask a songwriter for a music, I tell him to have a look at Nicki Minaj and the way she drops and I want to sing just like her or better. Audience Member Hi! Titica Hi! Olá! Audience Member Olá! I’m trying to think of how to formulate the question. I realize that the fact that you are a trans comes up a lot. I mean it’s come up here. Maybe just your presence is a political statement up to a certain degree. How do you deal with something that you’ve had to deal with so personally in such a political and public stance? Did that make sense? Titica Can you repeat, please? The questions are so long. I couldn’t quite understand your question. Maybe you could sum up. Anupa Mistry What is it, how does it affect you to have to always be kind of a... Audience Member How does it affect you to have a public, like to have to publicly deal... Yeah, help me. [laughs] I’m not sure how to formulate. Anupa Mistry Maybe that your presence always brings up these kinds of political questions. Audience Member And I can imagine that it’s something that is a very personal matter, as well. It’s had to go through a personal process. So, how do you deal with that? Or maybe you don’t deal with it. Maybe it’s something that comes very naturally as well. Titica It’s something that flows naturally. I don’t think about it. God knows I am me. First me, and then me, and then me. And then the rest. It’s shocking when people see this. But I’m respectful, I have my personality. I have my music to give and do my part. And I can hold my head high for anyone who finds inspiration in me. My attitude encourages a lot of people. I receive a lot of positive messages. Some people have already told me they’d thought about taking their own lives until they saw me holding my head high. The idea after seeing a respected black trans woman in Africa being: I wanted to live, to accept myself the way I am. In the past, I was not so aware of this. I sang for visibility. But since then I came to realize that I can influence and encourage people. I have this huge responsibility to hold my head high and make good music. And sometimes speak through my music about the respect for mankind. Audience Member Thanks. Anupa Mistry Anyone else in the room? OK. Thank you, once again, Titica. We really appreciate you. Titica Thank you, thank you! Thank you all for being here. And I apologize if you did not understand everything. Talking to you makes me a little nervous. When people see us they think we are always at ease. But here we become a bit shy. I am a bit timid. Anupa Mistry Great. Thank you!
[applause]
[applause]
[laughter]
[applause]
It’s a way to change people’s minds, but in a more educative way. Through our music and our art we can show people that despite our difference we bring them joy. We can make them laugh. We can be just like the others.
[applause]
[applause]
Shall we pass the mic around? We have a Portuguese speaker.

Vincent Moon
Born and raised in Paris, filmmaker, photographer and sound artist Vincent Moon doesn’t find occasion to return home often. A proud and purposeful nomad, he travels the world seeking to document the intersection between sound and image with his trusted Panasonic camera. Though he began his artistic career as a photographer, Moon gained notoriety in the mid-2000s for his Take Away Show project, a video podcast featuring musicians like Arcade Fire and R.E.M. performing outdoors in unusual locations. For the past several years, Moon has worked on his Petites Planètes series, which investigates traditional and religious music in locations like Chechnya. A firm believer in sharing artistic work in the digital age, he then uploads these videos as Creative Commons for anyone to view or repurpose.
In his lecture at Red Bull Music Festival Moscow 2018, Moon discussed the relationship between images and reality, the importance of simplicity in filmmaking and why we need to re-evaluate storytelling.
Hosted by Chal Ravens Welcome to Red Bull Music Festival in Moscow. We’re about to welcome a filmmaker whose work is really unlike a lot of filmmakers working today. He became recognized early on for his Take Away Shows, which were these spontaneous music videos filmed on the streets around Paris, his home city. For the past six or seven years, he’s basically been a nomad, I guess, traveling to dozens of different countries, and making literally hundreds of films. Typically, they explore things like traditional music and folklore, but also religious experience, mystical experience, the relations between all of these things. A lot of the music that he’s collected on his travels he’s released on his record label Petites Planètes. I think he’s gonna have a lot of interesting things to show us today and talk to us about. Please welcome Vincent Moon. Vincent Moon Good afternoon, everybody. Pleasure to be here with you in Moscow. I hope you are having a good time, and we’re gonna be here together for a little hour I guess. Chal Ravens We’ll have time for some questions at the end, so have a think. Before we get deeply into it, I wanted to ask you a bit about your background because I think you studied photography, right? And I wanted to ask a little bit about this approach that you have of recording in one take. This seems to be something that runs through all of your films. Where does that come from? Why do you operate in that way? Vincent Moon I guess from the beginning of my research into images I studied photography at first when I was in Paris. I was 18-19 years old. I really didn’t know anything. I didn’t grow up in an artistic environment or anything. It’s pretty late in my teenage years that I got interested in music, and cinema, and so on. When I got interested in that, I got pretty much obsessed, and I went full on. I tend to devour things.
I feel like almost ten years, from 18 to 26, let’s say, while living in Paris, I would basically spend my entire time going out and checking stuff. Going to museums, going to concerts, going to cinemas, and trying to see and hear everything. My visual relationship started at around that time when I decided to make photography. Early on, from the very beginning, my relation to photography was extremely DIY, extremely street photography, very influenced by William Klein, Robert Frank, Josef Koudelka, and Daidō Moriyama, and all those kind of photographers from the 20th century. A very much black and white, actually, aesthetic. Quite far from where I am, sort of, now. Little by little I realized that what I wanted was that incredible freedom of basically adding a little camera in my pocket, and going to the street and basically becoming a photographer, just like that. I didn’t have to have a bigger team or a bigger form of production to do that. Very quickly I switched towards being attracted, actually completely devoted to my music, and I wanted to get closer to music. I started to take photos of musicians actually. Little by little I decided to find a way to bridge those still images to moving image. I guess, early on, I should... even the photography I was interested about, there was a lot of movements even though it was always one image, in a sense. I’m talking especially about the work of people like Antoine d’Agata. I don’t know if you know him, his work of [unintelligible], sort of like turns of the century, a poetic type of relationship to society, and so on. I wanted to approximate that movement in an image. I realized that to cinema I was sort of referencing that I was crazy about, and I’m talking about basically simple things, people like [Andrei] Tarkovsky or [Stanley] Kubrick. This aesthetic of cinema was often very much based on long takes, take Béla Tarr and all those people. I was really obsessed with, what we call in French, plan séquence. Unfortunately there’s not a good translation in English for that way to explain. This plan séquence was basically a way, I realized, for me to simplify my relationship to the subject, my relationship to reality, to try to keep that sort of like unbroken moment. Basically, little by little, I developed a way to dance, I guess, with the subject. It became a matter, very quickly, early on, my interest of cinema was basically based on this, it was the meeting of images. I was coming from photography, but suddenly there was a sound aspect, which was also my obsession for music, and there was a third aspect, which was basically I will call it movement in space. How do you move in a social space? How do you create certain harmony with your surroundings? I guess it was basically with those very first ideas I started to make films, but I didn’t have time to think much more because I was making a lot of films, and every film, little by little, would give me a clue on where to go next. I was using this ability to make a lot of films in a short time to progress. I was publishing all my work since the very beginning. I was publishing all the work on the internet, and I’m still publishing all my work on the internet for free under Creative Commons license. It’s very important. That’s why, in a sense, I’m much more present on the internet than in film festivals and so on. I try to play another game. I try to expand how much can we use. I guess our talk will have a lot to do with this. How much can we use those digital tools to change the rules and to basically explore new ways to create simply, and to relate to each other? Then, little by little, yeah, I guess I started to create that and work around this language of those long shots, those long shots unbroken, which would basically sort of create, and I would realize that later, would create, in the eye of the viewer, something like a type of relationship where I would not basically try to create this kind of very cut, very impressive type of film where you, from the first second, you’re like, “Whoa.” You’re trapped in an intense way. It takes a little bit more time to get into my films, maybe, you know? One, two minutes of attention before you get into it. The desire, just to finish on that, was that with this technical language of long takes, I would basically try to make the technique disappear, you know? At some point you forget there’s a camera and you just stare into it. Chal Ravens That’s interesting. Yesterday, when we were talking, you mentioned this idea that your films, partly because you have so many of them I guess, function like your own memories because you were able to see things, see your own past through your films in a way, and I suppose that’s what a one take shot can do. It can put you in mind of just literally being there and moving in space I suppose. Vincent Moon Yeah, I like the idea, I guess, of one image being so powerful that it contains all over the other images in a way. I guess this idea, yeah we’re talking about this fact that I had a funny week last week, to be honest. I ended up in a chamber, locked in a chamber for a week. That was my desire. It was not a mistake. [laughs] Basically I was alone with myself and my brain. I realized how much my brain was nowadays composed of my films. The way I relate to the past is through my own images. I guess my desire was always to create a sublime version of my life, or a sublime version of reality because actually that’s what I think we should really question... That’s the way we should use our images nowadays, to question our reality. We know so well, we know very well now, and all of you know, that images have a massive impact on the way we relate to reality. The way we see society is actually through images, and the mass media is basically doing a terrible job because they’re not subliming reality, they’re destroying our psyche. We’re basically living in a world where mass media is based around images of violence. Those images of violence are basically destroying, more and more, the social tissue of society, the social relationship with all of us. Then my desire was basically: how can we use images in another way? How can we sublime reality because I know these images, in return, have an impact on the way we live together. It’s a very simple thing. Then that’s basically what I’ve been trying to do, subliming my own reality, creating things like long shots, which are basically so containing all of the other images that surrounded them in a sense. I know it’s a new way to relate to memory, and I guess we are changing as human beings. We are completely changing in the way we relate to our own body. What is internal in terms of tools? What is external, you know? We have to find a balance. I’m talking a lot about this with friends because, as I am studying a lot of indigenous knowledge nowadays, you just realize, “Oh, those guys didn’t lose some things that we lost,” like telepathy, for example, and so on. I have an iPhone, but those guys use telepathy. I’m like, “Shit, maybe I should rethink that relationship,” but that’s a long story. That’s where we are now I guess. Chal Ravens What do you think about the fact that, as technology has caught up, a lot of people choose to use their phones to do something kind of similar to what you do in just recording everything? Is the impulse that we all have to record things the same impulse that you’ve had to record things? Is there a relationship between that? Vincent Moon We have to be very responsible in terms of the images that we publish, I guess, very much. We have to realize that we are publishing so many images. We are all filmmakers in a sense. I do not think we educate people towards a certain language of images. I think we are... The language of images, nowadays, is getting more and more poor in that regard. I do not mean that everybody should see all the things of Tarkovsky, even though I wish [they would]. In a sense, we should really, really question that relationship we have with images and really think about anything we publish. Actually I’m not even talking about images, I’m talking about the way we use social networks and so on. I guess we mentioned last night – we had a long talk about the impact of images on the way we relate to our social fights. I was mentioning the work of someone that I really, really adore these days, Adam Curtis, who is basically putting his finger on the right spots. Adam Curtis is an English documentarian, and was making archival type of films, quite long films. One of his very important sayings in his last film is, “Our society is designed to make people angry because angry people click more, and it feeds society in return.” I guess we have to really question the relationship we have with images and social media in that regard. How do we basically, again, create another relationship with reality through the images we do? Why do we just jump on all the time and record everything around us? I think it’s because we are getting excited like kids about new tools we have. Hopefully this is gonna change. I’m pretty sure this is gonna change little by little, but unfortunately, the system, the capitalistic world, is not going to slow down anything. It’s basically maintaining this issue of releasing new tools that we do not need actually because we haven’t been able to integrate the tools we had like ten years ago already, you know? Those are extremely powerful tools, we just do not educate people to use them at their full potential, and then we have a new one on the market, and a new one on the market, and it never stops. Basically we’re kind of trapped into this rhythm, but I think, hopefully, people slowly are gonna change the way they relate to this craziness of recording everything. Just to end up on that, a friend of mine did a very interesting film two or three years ago named In Limbo (Dans les limbes), which is a film on memory and the way that we relate to memory in the digital age, and the way that we use digital tools to record. I really realized, through that, it was interviewing a few people who record everything. I mean everything. There was a few guys just going around in their life and having something there recording every second of their life in image. You’re like, “Oh my gosh, this shows so much how much we are afraid of death.” It’s basically related to death. We are like completely freaking out because death. We think death is the end. In return, I think, that’s kind of exactly why I’m exploring rituals and spirituality because there we have another take on reality. We have another proposal. That proposal, and which is the most ancient proposal of humankind, is basically death is not the end. There is another type of relationship we have to create with our own reality, which is the exact opposite of where this globalized, westernized society’s going, which is freaking out. Everybody’s freaking out in front of time. Chal Ravens I guess the process of image making itself is to do with preserving a moment, and creating a form of immortality through an image. There’s this relationship between why humans make art, I suppose. Vincent Moon The thing is that we always relate to, especially in the field that you work on, [unintelligible] as well, working, recording music from so called, actually, disappearing cultures, but again that’s a term I will like to come back on because I disagree a lot with this. But we tend to use... WWe talk about Alan Lomax, we talk about great researchers of the 20th century, and how much this is important to record. But I think we live in a very different time. We live in a very different time where the amount of recording gets to a point that we’re creating a completely nostalgic society. We are basically obsessed with the past, obsessed with sort of like a better past. We always look back like, “Oh, shit, it was much better before.” Really, it’s getting worse and worse. I think that’s this thing we have to turn around in a way. I think that’s also where anthropology is changing a lot these days, because it’s got to face the fact that basically we are not anymore in terms of preserving only. We are actually nowadays in the mission of creating new paths, creating new forms of cultures, new forms of music, new forms of rituals. That’s basically what I’m excited about. Because if we don’t create new stuff, we are dead. We’re just looking back and we are basically trapping everything into boxes and looking at things through the distance creating museums and being like, “Whoa, it was amazing.” Chal Ravens To kind of rewind a bit then, when you first started making films with people from other countries, traveling around becoming kind of a nomad, I’m interested in how you kind of started that project and if you knew what you were getting yourself into, if you like. Because it seems like you haven’t really stopped traveling and making films for the last seven years or so. And I wanted to know a bit about the actual process because... Do you basically make everything just on your own? You must need people to help you record sound or how does it actually work when you arrive in a new country? Vincent Moon Well, take the example of Russia. Last time I came here was six years ago. I’m going to try to slow down my rhythm because apparently it’s impossible to understand me when I talk so fast and my parents have always been telling me that. Six years ago I came to Russia because of that guy mostly, Bulat Khalylov. Wonderful. Thank you, brother, and pleasure to see you here really, man. He invited me to North Caucasus, [unintelligible] that’s where he lives. Basically, we talked about doing some recordings, and very quickly I explained to him that I could do most of the recordings by myself with his help. And so we went around for two months and something. We went to [unintelligible]. We went to Ossetia, went to Chechnya, went to Dagestan, went to Kalmykia and even more. And then I was in [unintelligible] with my friend Tatiana and all those recordings were made in a very simple way. Basically, I have a camera, and I have microphones.
Bulat was helping me, of course, first to translate and go around. That is always a very important person, doing that bridge, you know, and it was kind of like channeling all this culture towards me, and in a sense he was also helping me, basically placing the microphone in space. And there we go. And I love the accident. I love the fact that we are imperfect human beings. And I do believe that looking for perfection, in terms of cinema especially, has always been a trap to me. I never succeed to create a film that I have in mind. So I try not to have any idea, and create something that has to be created. It’s very simple. Much more like a ‘let it go’ way. I do not know what the film is going to look like, but if the film wants to happen, if the film had its own consciousness, it would happen and be created and I will help this to happen. But basically, it’s trained to not have any preconceived ideas around this, and in that regard, all of theses riches we made we like very... I mean I remember arriving in Chechnya and then realizing, “Whoa,” next day we are able to shoot a ritual and then next day again we got invited. We did not really plan things much in advance. There’s a little bit of planning, but not too much, to not get trapped in it. Chal Ravens At what point did you realize that you wanted to film religious rituals? Not just music but rituals and events that had a kind of deeper significance? Or did that just happen? Vincent Moon While I growing up in Paris, and when I was in my twenties, I used to go to a lot of concerts obviously. Mostly rock, pop, indie music. And that was my relationship and my knowledge of music. That basically music was something that people play on stage while other people listen drinking a beer. That was it, basically. I would go see a show, you know, amazing stuff. I’d be like, “This is it. This is the greatest expression of music now. I’m so happy I’ve seen that.” And basically, very simply, one night, especially one night, I was in Cairo in Egypt, and someone took me to a ritual. He was like, “You want to see something forbidden?” And I was like, “What do you mean forbidden?” “I’m going to show you something. I’m going to bring you to a place where people do something that they’re not allowed to do. It’s a trance ritual.” It was a Zār, Z-A-R, which is a form of Sufism that you find in Egypt, Sudan mostly. And I remember entering that little street I could hear the music coming from farther, the percussion, and the voices. And then I entered this place, and it was not only musically stunning, it was something else. It was basically music played for the gods. It was music played for healing. It was music played for another reason than entertaining and it changed my life. It blew my mind, because I did not grow up with that knowledge that actually music was made for that. But then I decided to be on the road, and to really question the fact, where is music coming from? Why do we play music? And then of course you realize, especially if you are lucky, that I had the privilege to go to all of those places... In a very punk way, though. I never had the real money to do any of this, but I always found a way to do it. Then you realize people play music basically to call the gods, that is basically why it is there from the very beginning. Music is there to harmonize with nature. Music comes from the fact that birds are already singing so at some point man had to do something, in nature you know, and the thing is, it’s a very simple thing, and that relationship is still extremely present if you look at it in most of the music we do. Sometimes, we’re just maybe not conscious about that. And I wanted to explore this deeply. Chal Ravens A lot of your films have been made in South America. There was a huge project called Híbridos, which is all the music and many religious traditions of Brazil, which is all available on a really nice website, which has it all available. And we’re going to watch a clip which is also from somewhere in South America. Are we going to watch that one? Vincent Moon Yeah, of course, we’re going to start with this one. I wanted to show... We did a little selection of short films. Of very simple ones. Chal Ravens So, the first one is, I think, from Buenos Aires? Vincent Moon Yes. And I actually wanted to start with a little film. Back in the days, I think it was like nine years ago I did that one. It’s part of the Global Take Away Shows project, which is a project I did with a friend of mine for some years, but I mean on that shooting I was basically alone. I was spending some days in Buenos Aires, and the story goes that I got invited into a show one of the first days I was there, and things got a bit chaotic for me that night. And all I could remember the next morning was this beautiful melody, which goes like [sings]. I was like, “Who was that guy playing? I want to film that song.” And it took me some days to find the guy and to convince him to do it, and then he called me actually. He said, “We can do the recording. I finally found a band. We are ready. We’ll meet you in two hours at this bar. And I just showed up at the bar, and we did this little song. So I hope you enjoy it, it’s one of my favorite songs actually. [uintelligible] Vincent Moon Beautiful people. It’s so simple, you know. Again the circle, that dance, all of us together in a grand circle. There’s something so ritualistic in that thing. And in a sense, which can encapsulate as well very much my entire experience in Buenos Aires, all compressed into one shot. Chal Ravens I’m really fascinated by how you can record the sound. Sorry to ask this technical question but, the sound is so rich, and it even seems to correspond slightly, it seems to be moving around. How do you do it? Do you have somebody setting up separately? Vincent Moon How do you do it Bulat? This was very simple, right. Every time people ask me that the first thing I say is, “I don’t know.” It has to be very simple. And I never get obsessed with technical aspects, and I think the trap, on many levels, is that we get obsessed. You could say we are all turning a little bit too geeky in our relationship to those tools. As I said before, a really deep education on how to use those technical tools, especially in the field of cinema, we should be very careful of not getting obsessed, of too much knowledge of the technique. When people ask me anything about camera, I have no idea. I don’t know any other camera than mine. And I don’t even know the name of my camera. I know it’s a Panasonic camera that I’ve been using for many years. Same thing for the microphones. I think you have to be very simple. I am using external microphones, recorders, mostly Zoom, the Japanese brand, and H2N and now H6 which is a very good one, and sometimes I’m using like lavalier mics depending on the situation. But it’s always very simple. Incredibly simple actually. Chal Ravens How much research to you tend to do when you go to a country? As your life-project has gone on, do you feel like you’re looking for specific things? Or do you try to avoid that planning? Vincent Moon Exactly. I think the goal is really to avoid any planning. So last week I was in Gabon in Africa. It’s a very crazy country. And the first thing those guys, when I went to the temple, told me was that, “You have to fucking stop planning your life. You know? You have to let it go. That is the problem of the white world. You’re obsessed with organization.” And I know what he was talking about because I come from such a frame, such a way to relate to reality, and little by little, I learned about improvisation. And when I used that word ‘improvisation’ I use it in a way that this is at the core of everything in my life now. Everything. This talk, the live we’re going to do with Rabih [Beaini]. Everything is like in a sense very carefully prepared on some levels, but to the point that it allows you this complete freedom on the spot. And that’s the way I tried to research, by basically having access to a lot of information, asking many many questions to people everywhere I go, and then switching to the place, to the fact that basically, “Now, let’s see what happens.” And then magic happens. And really, magic happens. In the way you are attracted to this place or that place without really planning it. People invite you into amazing things. And this magic happens only if you are really able to let it go at some time. So it’s kind of like this funny game. How do we step on that? We have to... At least for me, I had to find this balance. And I’m still working on it. And working more and more towards sort of freeing myself from my intellectual relationship to reality. To shut off the brain, basically. Chal Ravens We’re going to have another clip. Well, let’s talk a little bit about Russia. You have traveled to all kinds of places around here, on several different trips right? Vincent Moon Well actually, I came here, I came to Russia the first time 19 years ago. I wish I could have shown that video. I’m not really going to have time. Let me check, actually. It’s not too long. I did my very first photo work in Russia. It was in 1999 I think, or 2000. And I came to Moscow with a friend without having no idea except we wanted to go to Vladivostok. And in a magical way we found a way to get into the train, and then we traveled for like ten days towards Vladivostok. And I did my first work there at the time. Chal Ravens Did you know what you were going to find there? Or you just went first? Vincent Moon We had no idea. We were completely... We were very lost at the time. I was 18, and I was discovering the world. It was my very first big project. I’m not sure I’m going to find this anymore. I’ll give you the link. All of my things are on my website. And then I came back six years ago, and then as I said, with Bulat we traveled a bit in the Caucasus, in the northern Caucasus, which is a place that is very delicate for the Russian mind. Very little explored in terms of music especially. So we found very much. It was an incredible adventure. We discovered so many things there on the spot. And I did a few films over three months. I guess I made something like 25 films over three months, so I did a lot. Chal Ravens Just as a pause, I think I read that over the period of about six years you made something like 50 films a year. Vincent Moon Yeah, something like that. Chal Ravens Can you just explain how that’s possible? I mean obviously, you are often filming in one take, so that editing is a little bit easier. But in terms of being able to keep that up, do you seek to keep making that many or is it that you have so much stuff that you just have to make? Vincent Moon There is a part of me that wants to slow down and a part of me that does not. A lot of people around me are mostly worried about that. Like, “Come on, you have to slow down, you have to stop making so many films.” The thing is that that is my way to relate to reality. To put it simply, it’s not a job at all, even though I do make a little bit of money on this now, very little. It’s basically my way to live, my way to engage in the social moment and live an incredible adventure. And so I don’t really want to slow down those adventures. I want to keep having them. I don’t know. I work a lot, and I guess I’m very organized, so I am able to go from one project to another. This summer I made like four films one after another. One in Corsica, one in Calabria, one in the Faroe Islands, one in Berlin. And it was incredible. It goes very, very fast, and very demanding, but it works very well. Chal Ravens What do those films mean to you when you finish them? Because when you’re making so many, do you come back to them regularly? How do you relate to them after they have been made? Vincent Moon That’s interesting. So basically the first reason, maybe I should have started like that, but basically why I make those films is I want to create some very beautiful memories for the people I film. So the first thing is I give back the films to the people that I filmed. Especially in the Híbridos, the Brazilian project where we made 99 films, actually over four years, plus a long feature film and plus many other things. We sent back all the films to the people we filmed asking them for comments and critiques before publishing them, so it took a long time to get the feedback from everybody. But for me it was very important to find that balance. Basically, I want to create maybe... It’s like this old time family portrait, or maybe like this troubadour. Imagine like a photograph troubadour going from villages to villages documenting life, and basically giving a photo in exchange for a meal. So I guess it’s basically I was really, really excited about finding that balance. How can we [unintelligible], there is old term of potlatch, for example, which is very beautiful indigenous term from Northern America, which means this type of exchange between tribes where you would give something, then the tribe will give something else a little bit more important, and again, and again, and again. So going back to this type of sharing, which means basically I do not pay the musicians that I film. I’m really trying to convince them to do these recordings for free, but in return trying to also explain very well why I am doing this. It creates very healthy type of relationship, I think. That’s what I loved with all those people I’ve been filming. Then I publish, obviously, all the films on internet and I do not promote them. I do not really put away any promotion of my work, for different reasons. I cannot really go into details now, but basically, I like the fact that they circulate in a way or another. Some films are not going to be seen at all. Some others are going to hit a million views without me noticing, but they have their own life, and I really like that it goes with the flow in a way, no? Again, I do not really show my work in film festivals or so on. I’m just trying to use alternative ways to celebrate all this richness that we have created as humankind as a whole. In a sense, personally then, the fact that I’m playing live now is a way... That’s the way I’ve been rediscovering my own films, actually, because when I play live I edit them live and mix them in an improvised way. Every time’s completely different, so tonight I’m going to play with... I prepared 150 films, so I don’t know how many I’m going to play. Probably a third of that, and going to slice them and edit them very fast, and it always creates a new story, and I love that. Chal Ravens So it’s like a DJ with their record bag. They choose 150 records to bring, and then you can just mix them together. Vincent Moon And every mix is always different in such a way. Again, I think also it’s the live experiment, which is obviously for me the most exciting part of what I’m doing now is also really based on the fact that I do disagree a lot with what we call storytelling, especially in terms of cinema. Basically, for the past three, five to ten years, under the influence of TV and TV series, cinema has become something else, which is extremely based on storytelling and basically the efficiency of storytelling, which is basically how much you’re going to captivate your audience from beginning to the end. I think this is very effective. It works very well, and we see that, and the success of Netflix is obviously a way to show that, I guess, there’s a lot desire to get trapped. But I do believe that we need so much to rethink our images in a different way, because I do disagree a lot with storytelling in terms that it is actually the tool of the system very much to get trapped again. It’s a relation to time, the matrix we explore. In a sense, when you go into rituals, into spirituality, into indigenous knowledge, you realize that people do have another relationship to time. It’s not a timeline. Cinema, since the beginning, has been based on the timeline. I still have to go through the timeline to edit my films, and that’s a limit, in a way. I want to kind of think about a way... How can I work away from the timeline? How can I work away from the beginning, the middle, and the ending? How can I work in this constant movement of images and sound? That’s why I explore installations where there are films going on on multi screens for hours and hours, and there is no beginning and neither ending. It’s you as a human being who’s going to have your own experience. I want to create those settings where people do have something extremely intimate in relationship with all the images. Chal Ravens Well, on the theme of circles, then, do you want to show the next film? Vincent Moon So I’m going to show a little extract of it. I’m going to start playing the music of it now. So it’s part of a series of a few films we made with Bulat in Chechnya, and I name it The Great Jihad because... I will explain you after. Sufi rituals from Chechnya. Chal Ravens Can you explain a bit about what was going on in that scene? Vincent Moon Sort of quickly. Basically, such rituals are happening, as we discovered, very often, and basically a family will throw a ritual, organize a ritual mostly related to the celebration of the death of someone, and I do not remember who was getting celebrated, but I guess someone who died in the family one or two years before. There is obviously, then, the same in Islam, a person gets buried the day of his death, so basically there is Zikr happening right on the moment of that just after the person dies, and then a year, and two years, and a few years after, depending on the importance of the person, there is celebration of his memory in such a way. So this is basically the main part, which is named Zikr or Dhikr, and obviously this goes for a long time. I guess it was going for an hour, probably, and hour and a half nonstop. Before this and after this there is prayers. What fascinates me with Sufism, ‘cause I’ve done a lot of research on this mystical part of Islam in different parts of the world from Indonesia to Ethiopia to Morocco, and is that they have such an incredible diversity of ritual, diversity of basically transcendental tools in a way. We often, when you think about Sufism, we always have this very lovely version of the whirling dervishes from Turkey, but this is very much related to that part of the world. In other places, as you can see here, it’s very different, and people do not have [unintelligible] knowledge of those, and especially when you talk about Chechnya, when people think it’s radical Islam living there, which is not. Absolutely not, actually. It’s very mystical Islam. Chal Ravens All of these projects, I suppose, as you’ve gone on, it’s you exploring all the kinds of music that are so divorced from anything like an entertainment industry. It’s all to do with music as a ritual, and particularly this idea of entering a trance. It pops up frequently in all of these places that you go to, these kind of experiences where people kind of leave their own bodies almost in a group situation. Vincent Moon Because for me, I think it’s very important to, to put it very simply, I’m interested in how can we trance again? How can we recreate in the Western world as well this relationship to something that we all did at some point? We all come from that, and I think we live in a very complex time in terms of identities. To put it very simply, I think we’re getting trapped in seeing the world as a division of identities and cultures. If you sort of go back a bit more in time, rewind a little bit to the point that we all come from the same place and basically we’ve been... In a way, that’s the greatest lesson that those guys in Gabon, for example, last week told me is that, “You fucked up with this idea of basically divisions and you’re all fighting all against each other. You don’t realize it’s all the same thing. Everybody’s doing the same thing since the most ancient times. It’s just different dresses and different singings and different sounds and colors, but it’s all the same stuff.” Now, our mission nowadays in this society is to basically bring it all back together, and to realize how much, wow, we have to take it easy and step back a bit and zoom on a larger scale in time, especially. Realizing that we are not going anywhere by treating the world as separate identities and people doing different stuff, that you cannot touch. You are you, you little white people going to Africa doing recordings with those guys. I’m like, “Fuck, I am myself basically saying hello to those guys trying to unify and getting to a trance.” Because the trance is basically this most ancient tool to reach towards something away from your ego, obviously, and our society being trapped into an intellectual relationship towards everything, we are getting completely fucked by the ego. That’s why, I think, that rituals on many levels, many different forms of rituals, have to be reimplemented and sort of recreated almost to the point that we all trance again, and we all reaccess that direct knowledge. Again, we’re not talking about religious relationship, because religion has been doing the exact opposite in a way by taking us away from the transcendence, by basically organizing this relationship to a god that you cannot touch. In the rituals, even in a Sufi ritual, even though they will never use the word trance, basically people are reaching a level where they let it go. They let it go and something else goes through them. Of course, the project I’ve done in Brazil was very much based on that, because Brazil is the ultimate trance country. Everybody [uses] trance in a way, from Carnival to Candomblé, everybody uses crazy techniques to basically get out of their mind. I think that’s what we need to make a better world. Chal Ravens Astonishingly, we’ve got about six minutes left, so I think it would be better to have some questions than to show a clip, even though we have another clip, because all the clips are online. Vincent Moon I think it’s alright, because I will show a lot of things related to trance after in the live show, so maybe we can have a few questions to end up on. OK? Chal Ravens OK. Does anybody have a question? Chal Ravens There’s a microphone going around. No? If not, then I was going to ask you very quickly, if you could explain why you make all your work available through Creative Commons? Vincent Moon Yeah. It’s very simple. I think that basically there is something you learn as well in many of those spiritual traditions, even though I don’t use the word traditions much, but let’s say a spiritual lineage or something. I would take the example of the Santo Daime Church. The Santo Daime Church is an incredible, very unique form of organization in Brazil which is not even 100 years old. We call it the ayahuasca Catholic church. It’s basically a Catholic sacrament using ayahuasca at the core. It’s very beautiful rituals and we’re probably going to show something after, during the live show about that. The Santo Daime is very unique, especially because the music of the Santo Daime keeps evolving constantly. It’s very beautiful. It’s very refined. It’s very unique. It does not correspond to anything you’ve heard coming from any church. What they say, they say that they receive the songs. Basically, they do not write down the songs. Let’s say over one ritual you would sing the book of Mestre Irineu, but it’s not the book of the songs by Mestre Irineu, the master who created the doctrine. It’s the book of songs that he received, and it’s made very clear. What I mean by this is that basically you do not create anything from scratch. You just remix something which was there way before you and which is going to be there after you. Basically you’re just there to tune that frequency and maybe turn it into something more beautiful, or at least maintaining the vibration of beauty. Right? So what I mean is that there is nothing you are the owner of. The whole idea of the copyrights that is so much present in our society now is completely wrong in relationship to where this is all coming from. It’s an idea which is basically sustaining a system which slowly is preventing ourself from freedom and from free access to this gigantic knowledge that humankind have been created. This whole copyright thing is very much related to a specific moment in time where we were basically trapped into materiality. From films themselves, the rolls of films, to basically vinyl and CDs and so on in music. Come the digital age. What is the digital age? The digital age is the reawakening of spirituality because basically the digital tools allow you to copy without limit the same thing without losing quality. This is basically exactly how spirituality works. This is the way it goes. Knowledge can be copied and shared for free forever where there is no limit to that. So basically, obviously, why Creative Commons comes in the game at same point, because at some point this guy Lawrence Lessig and a few other guys just like realized this is going stupid with copyright now, because we are not allowing people to fully express their potential, and to fully share to another level. I really believe that we have to get to another level. We have to get better at it, and I mean it, our society has to get better at it. Artists have to get much better at what we’re doing. We’re not good enough. We really have to get better at sharing stuff, at creating new forms of music, new forms of everything, and trying to create new forms of hybrids especially in between art forms. Then Creative Commons and open source licenses are exactly there for that, in a way, and that’s why I’m very interested in the hacker movement as well, because this is where we have to go. We have to hack the machine, because that’s what the shamans have been doing from the most ancient time. This is the same stuff, and it’s not just a funny parallel. This is it. This is the reawakening of... this is the archaic revival, as [Terence] McKenna used to say. This is where we are in time. It’s like we are now realizing that those ancient tools, the shamanic tools, are not old stuff. They’re stuff coming from the future. We have to use those ones, combine them with those things to make an amazing form of living together. We’re just at the beginning of it, and we have to get better. It’s coming. Chal Ravens That’s a lot of things to think about for the future. Vincent will be playing lots of his films very shortly as part of the Live Cinema Project, so stick around and get to see more of these incredible shots, so thank you very much to Vincent. Vincent Moon Thanks a lot, Chal. Thanks to you. Thanks to everybody, this beautiful place, and I hope you’re going to have a wonderful night. I’m sure you will, actually. I will try to be with you dancing. See you soon. Chal Ravens Thank you.

Title: Yuzo Koshiro

Yuzo Koshiro
Yuzo Koshiro is a Japanese composer, arranger and programmer whose contributions helped change video game music. Having discovered video games and their music at an early age, Koshiro learned to program using an NEC PC-8801 before landing his first jobs in the industry in early 1980s Tokyo, scoring the background music for games like Bosconian, Tower of Druaga and Sega’s 1987 hit Shinobi. Breaking away from the conventions of early BGM soundtracks, which favored pop, rock and jazz, Koshiro set up his own company, Ancient, and quickly established himself as a pioneer in the field thanks to his programming knowledge and early mastery of FM sound chips. He made his biggest impact with the soundtrack to Sega’s early ’90s beat ’em up series Streets Of Rage, taking cues from dance music including techno, house and drum & bass, and as a result influencing generations of fans and artists such as Just Blaze, Flying Lotus and Ikonika. In 2017, Koshiro and longtime colleague Motohiro Kawashima embarked on a two-year world tour as part of RBMA’s Diggin’ In The Carts series, performing their Streets of Rage scores live for the first time.
In this public lecture, held as part of Red Bull EWKND in Stockholm, Koshiro sat with Diggin’ In The Carts host and video game historian Nick Dwyer to discuss the early days of his career, how he and Kawashima sought inspiration in nightclubs for Streets of Rage and why he never let limitations stop him from pushing video game music forward.
Hosted by Nick Dwyer Our guest who we’ll be speaking with next for a while is a very legendary figure indeed. He was born in Tokyo towards the end of the ‘60s, grew up in the ‘70s and by 1986, he was completely and utterly in love with Japanese video game music, which was a very new thing at the time, and decided that he wanted to become a video game composer. He went on to compose music for some of the most legendary titles in the history of video game music. He still composes music today. And it just so happens that some of these soundtracks that he has composed music for, 25, 30 [years] on, he is now finding himself performing in some of the best clubs around the world for the very first time. Ladies and gentlemen, can you please put your hands together for Yuzo Koshiro. [applause] Koshiro-san, first and foremost, thank you. How are you? Yuzo Koshiro I am fine. Nick Dwyer You’re well. Is it a good feeling to be here in Sweden for the very first time? Yuzo Koshiro My first impression of Sweden in my first visit to this country is... What I felt most is that the people here are very calm. The townscape is beautiful; the sea is very close to the town. I mean, the landscape is really beautiful. More than those, however, what impressed me most was that the people here are very calm even though they are living in such a big city. Nick Dwyer Koshiro-san, just quickly as well, there’s an interesting connection now between you and Sweden. And I believe, yeah, you’re even working on a video game with a Swedish company. Is that correct? Yuzo Koshiro Yes, it is. I have not composed any music yet, but I have a plan to work with a Swedish game company in the very near future. Nick Dwyer I mean, it’s been happening for about a year now that you’ve been touring around the world. And you’ve now played in a number of countries, at very incredible clubs [and] festival stages. I guess you’re possibly getting a little bit more used to it, but do you still find it strange that here you are in Sweden, performing music that you made for a video game – which was never intended to be danced to or heard in a nightclub – but you’re performing it 25 years later, for the very first time? Yuzo Koshiro I can’t find a good answer to your question, but... Regarding the Streets of Rage [soundtrack], which will be played later today, I used to love dance music from the beginning, and it was around 1990. I wanted to adopt the dance music I used to listen to into the games. That’s how the music of the Streets of Rage was created. It was like 25 or 30 years ago, and when I participated in the tour called Diggin’ in the Carts I had never dreamed I would play the music here in Europe which I had created with the influence of foreign music like European or American dance music. So, I am so excited about that. Nick Dwyer Alright, I’m going to play a track now. This is something... Actually, I’ll play it and then I’ll ask you about it in a second. (music: Yuzo Koshiro – “Blast Power!”) That was music made for a video game called Bosconian which was released back in 1988. And you were probably, what – 21, 22 years old at the time when that track was made? When you listen to that track right now, what does it take you back to? What do you think of when you hear that track? Yuzo Koshiro I think I composed [for] the Bosconian back in 1988. At that time I used to love the music of Mr. Shinji Hosoe, who was working for Namco, and I was so influenced by him. The other thing I need to mention is that the game music of that time in the ‘80s is categorized as jazz fusion. For instance, there is a Japanese music band named Casiopea, which influenced a lot of Japanese game music composers. So, jazz fusion was the trend in game music at that time. And this Blast Power is one of those influenced by that kind of music. Nick Dwyer What’s interesting about this time in Japan? I don’t know if many people realize this, but video game music was a genre. Records were being made and young people were buying records of video game music. There was a record label called G.M.O. Records that would release music from a number of different video games companies. Can you tell us, what was G.M.O. Records and how important was G.M.O. Records for video game music in Japan at this time? Yuzo Koshiro G.M.O. was one of the sublabels of the Japanese record label Alfa Records and was established by Mr. Haruomi Hosono who was a member of the music band YMO [Yellow Magic Orchestra], which you probably know. The label was created to release exclusively game music and, as far as I know, it was the first music label dedicated to game music. In those days, there were no such genres of music as game music, so what people used to do was that they would go to a game center and record the game sound with a tape recorder, and enjoy listening to it at home. And then, Mr. Haruomi Hosono realized how wonderful game music was and created the G.M.O. label. Then, he released his first record named Xevious. What made me feel happy was that YMO was my favorite music band and one of the members of that group released a record for game music. I was so excited about that. It was not only me who was so excited. So were all the game music fans of that time. Nick Dwyer So, Koshiro-san, were you one of these young game music fans that would take your walkman down to the game center to record video game music? Yuzo Koshiro Are you asking if I used to go to the game center because I wanted to listen to the game music as a game music fan or something like that? I can’t hear well. That’s right. Yes, that is correct. Xevious is really wonderful in terms of game music, but there is a video game I liked so much called Circus. In that game, you needed to break as many balloons as possible jumping on a seesaw. I used to love the sounds of that game when they were merely sound effects and were not played melodically. From that time, I loved game music and it was natural for me that I would decide to compose music for games. Nick Dwyer One thing I would love to ask you is, let’s talk a little bit briefly about this era before video games came to Japan and revolutionized the way young people up and down the country played in general. You, as I mentioned earlier on, you were born at the end of the ’60s and came up in the 1970s. What can you remember of your childhood? What would you do for fun before the arrival of video games? Yuzo Koshiro Before video games arrived in Japan, as you know, the first video games which became very popular in Japan, I can say, were Famicom. However, there were other video games which had been released by other toy companies before Famicom like Sega and Epoch. There were many different kinds of video games and I loved them all so much. But if you ask me what I used to do at that time, I don’t remember well because I was too small. I guess I used to do what any boys like to do, like play baseball, soccer, tag. I guess I used to do ordinary things. Nick Dwyer Around about the late ’70s a certain video game arrived and completely changed the culture in Japan which was of course, Space Invaders. Can you remember the feeling seeing Space Invaders the first time, and just how much of an impact did Space Invaders have? Yuzo Koshiro I can’t find the right words to explain what an impact Space Invaders made on me, but it was something like I had never seen before. Before the game appeared, the balls and rackets were the only tools to play on a video game. However, you shot at the space invaders, in other words, the aliens. The way it is played or the gameability were completely new to me at the time, and I was so fascinated and devoted to it. I think it made a huge impact on me. Nick Dwyer I mean... Sorry, I’ll let you finish. What was interesting at the time is basically you had what were called Invader Houses and at these Invader Houses, it was just nothing but floors and floors and floors of Space Invaders games. And I think parents were very scared if their kids went to an Invader House. They didn’t have the best reputation. Did your mother let you go to play Space Invaders or no? Yuzo Koshiro I think my mother was not happy with the fact that I used to go to an Invader House and play there, but when I was a student, I used to get fair marks at school so, she did not complain because she thought as long as I studied and practiced the piano so hard, I could do anything I liked to do. Nick Dwyer I’d like to talk about your mother just for a moment if that’s okay, because she was obviously an inspirational figure for a number of reasons but definitely musically. Now, your mother was a piano teacher and she taught at a very legendary music school in Japan called the Kunitachi College of Music. Yeah, tell us about your mother. I believe that she also had some quite notable pupils. Yuzo Koshiro My mother had a lot of pupils and gave lessons to them. They are not so famous, but they turned out to be really good pianists. One of them is the wife of Mr. Joe Hisaishi. She was one of my mother’s students. That connection led me to eventually have lessons from Mr. Hisaishi. I owe it to my mother. Nick Dwyer So, basically, Joe Hisaishi’s wife was a pupil of your mother’s and in turn you became a pupil of Joe Hisaishi. So, he taught you. How old were you when you were taking lessons from Hisaishi Jō? Yuzo Koshiro I was seven years old when I was taking the lessons from Mr. Hisaishi. I was so small that he was not teaching me something very difficult, but there was one very notable thing that he used to ask me to improvise. More specifically, he played some melodies on the piano and suddenly asked me to continue playing melodies after him. He told me I could play as I wanted, but needed to think and compose melodies of my own. I had that kind of lesson several times, and I think I enjoyed it very much. Nick Dwyer So when you were seven years old, this was the middle of the ’70s and before Joe Hisaishi became so famous, especially through the Miyazaki films, the Studio Ghibli films. How did you feel in the early ’80s when you started watching films like Nausicaä and a lot of the Ghibli films? You know, your teacher was responsible for that. How did that feel? Yuzo Koshiro At that time, Nausicaä and Mr. Hayao Miyazaki were not so famous as they are now, so, I did not know he was engaged in a big project like that. Then, after 2000, he had become so famous that now I hesitate to talk to him as frankly as before. I could never imagine that he would become such an important artist. Nick Dwyer One thing I would love to know is, can you just paint a picture for us of being a young boy growing up in Tokyo in the late ’70s and early ’80s. What’s very interesting is that all of a sudden all of this technology was permeating all of these different forms of culture. You spoke before about the arrival of video games, and these video games were being made by Japanese companies. But also in music, synthesizers and all of these Japanese companies, be it Roland or Korg or Yamaha doing, you know, many things with synthesizers as well. I mean, did it feel almost at that age, [in the] late ’70s early ’80s in Japan, that the future was arriving? Yuzo Koshiro Roland and Korg were... No. I would explain it in a different way. My mother used to teach me classical music. I also learned playing the violin from a different teacher from when I was five. I used to learn only classical music when I was small. So, it was such a big shock when I first heard Y.M.O.'s music. I fell in love with it. They used to play the synthesizers and most of that musical instruments, like 50% of them were made in Japan by companies like Yamaha, Korg and Roland. They used to use the instruments made by those Japanese companies. The music YMO [made], the sounds they played which were so futuristic, so, I thought the musical instrument called synthesizer was something that created the sounds of the future. Thanks to YMO, I discovered that instrument, so, in that sense, I agree. Nick Dwyer So what you were talking about before was this idea that all of these video game music fans would take their Walkmans to the game center and record music. And I want to play everyone something. This came out in 1984 and it is the soundtrack to a game called The Tower of Druaga. (music: Junko Ozawa – “The Tower of Druaga”) Alright, so that soundtrack there, why is that important for you, Yuzo? Yuzo Koshiro The title of this music is “The Tower of Druaga” and it is the BGM [background music] for that game. What makes it different from other music is that, it’s difficult to explain, but before the arrival of this music, most of the game music had been created based on rock, jazz or pop. But as you can hear, this music is very symphonic. There was no game music in which symphonic melodies were used. When I listened to this for the first time, it was really eye-opening and I said, “I have never heard this kind of music before. This is amazing.” I was so impressed and copied this music in my computer for the first time. I could play almost the same melodies in my computer. As you know, I was so devoted to it. Nick Dwyer When you’re talking about your PC, that became quite an important part of your life. What was the PC that you had and when did you start to program yourself? Yuzo Koshiro There is a company whose name is NEC in Japan and it used to release a series of computers and one of them was called PC-8801. It was sold in huge quantities because many video games were installable on that computer. At that time, many games for the PC-8801 were released and there were no video game consoles like Famicom. So, if you wanted to play video games, there were no other options than using that computer. It cost more than 200,000 yen and it was very expensive. But my mother bought it for me when I entered high school. At first, I used the computer just to play video games, but afterwards I learned how to do programming, and started to do it. After some time, FM sound sources were equipped on some models of the PC-8801 series which allowed the users to play music in the computer. For me, that was the reason why I started composing music. So, the PC-8801 series computers mean a lot to me. Nick Dwyer It must be noted as well that you were programming in BASIC back then and I believe you became quite famous in BASIC – there was a magazine right? – in Japan. Can you tell us about that? Yuzo Koshiro There used to be a magazine called BASIC which is now discontinued. What made the magazine really great is that it used to have PC program lists in it. I mean, if you bought it and programmed the lists on your computer, then you could play the games. In those days, it was not very common to buy video games and play, so, you needed to program to play. So, the program lists in the BASIC magazines were something very important that used to excite game fans. Some years later, I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to work for the magazine as a program writer. One day I went to the magazine publisher to let them listen to the programming of “The Tower of Gruaga” BGM, which we played a few minutes ago, and they liked it very much. That’s why I had a series in the magazine. It means a lot to me. Nick Dwyer Koshiro-san just quickly, what did you love about programming? I mean, it was all of a sudden a new thing. It had never been seen before. As you started to learn how to program, what did you love about it? Yuzo Koshiro I learned programming almost all by myself, but initially a friend of mine in junior high school was very good at it and he taught me. During my high school days, I studied programming alone and created my own programs. After graduation, I joined a programming club, a kind of group of programming fans. Its name was Harvest. In that group, there are a lot of members who were really good at programming so I learned from them as well. After some time, I started working at a company called Nihon Falcom where I got to know so many amazing programmers. I also learned how to program in a variety of ways from them. Nick Dwyer You mentioned before about FM synth and I just want to ask, when we’re at this point in time, just how important for music – not as video game music, but also in the music industry and pop music – was FM synth? And I guess, what was FM synth? Could you describe what FM synth is as simply as you can? For music and video game music: FM synthesis. Yuzo Koshiro Many people may not know what FM synthesis is for, as the term is a little bit technical, but it was developed by Yamaha. Before it appeared, analog synthesizers were the mainstream, but after digital chips for FM synthesis appeared, the musical expressions became more enriched in many ways. I mean the functions of FM synthesis are so amazing and each tiny chip has all those functions in it. That is why many game companies adopted them for their video games. This is how the game music evolved, thanks to FM synthesis. The first time I listened to music played with FM sound source was Space Harrier. And that music was so wonderful that it made me think I was going to be a game music composer. I mean, FM synthesis was such an important thing for me. Nick Dwyer And I’ve got that track right here. So, this is the track that you’re talking about. This is the main theme from Space Harrier. So, there you go. (music: Hiroshi Kawaguchi – “Main Theme from Space Harrier”) That one is from 1985, Hiro Kawaguchi, Space Harrier. Hiroshi-san. Now can I just ask, what was the feeling like. One of the things that’s interesting, the game Space Harrier was a Sega game. In the middle of the 1980s – if anyone in this room is old enough to remember – Sega really dominated the arcades in the middle of the 1980s. And if you walked into a game center, you’d see these big cabinets, be it Out Run or Space Harrier or After Burner and the music was cool. It sounded cool. What was the reputation of… you know, how did Sega games feel for you back then? Yuzo Koshiro The Sega sounds at that time were... If you listen to the Space Harrier, you will recognize how great the sound is, but this is music released in 1985. How many years ago? 40... 30...? 33 years ago? You are right. It is a long time ago. We listened to The Tower of Druaga a few minutes ago, but Space Harrier was released right after it. It surprised us, you know, incredibly. As this nice music suddenly came out, I fell in love with it in a second. Sega, at that time, was the pioneer company in terms of game music and video games. They launched so many arcade games and all of them were so interesting and had beautiful game music. Especially, I loved the music composed by Mr. Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who is the composer of Space Harrier. I still think he is one of Sega’s best ever composers. Nick Dwyer As you said before, this was the track that inspired you to become a video game composer yourself, which you soon went on to do. How did you do that? How does one become a video game composer? Did you have meetings with companies? Did you send in demos? Yuzo Koshiro As I said earlier, I had a series of music programming articles in the BASIC magazine. In earlier days, I used to copy the music of Sega, Konami or Nintendo games, and played them in my computer. Then, I started to feel like composing my own. I didn’t think I was going to create something big, but felt like I could make one. I wasn’t meant to sell it to somebody. But one day, a game programming magazine called Login posted an ad for music staff at Nihon Falcom. I had five or six songs I had composed at the moment, so, I decided to ask them to listen to the music I composed. The company was located close to my house, so I took a train there, and asked them to listen. Then, immediately they said they wanted to use my music for a game they were launching. I was really surprised, but said, “Yes. Please go ahead.” That is how the music for Xanadu Scenario 2 was born. That was the first time a song of mine was used for a video game which was commercially available. Nick Dwyer Alright, so, Yuzo, you are in your very early 20s – no, you were not even in your 20s. So, Yuzo, you’re still a teenager and you are working at a video game company making music. How did that feel? Did that feel like a pretty cool job to be doing? Did it feel like a dream come true? I don’t know. What was it like to work at a video game company in the 1980s? Yuzo Koshiro As I said earlier, I was not looking for a job in the game music industry, but I just happened to take my songs there, which were adopted for a game. That is how I started working in this industry. It didn’t hit me at that time. I liked game music so much, but it didn’t hit me I had become a game music composer. The first game I was engaged in at Nihon Falcom was Ys and after the game was released, I received a lot of postcards saying people liked the music, or many other comments. So, I felt very happy to do this job for the first time. Before, I had admiration for the music of Sega and Konami, but I never imagined that I would be part of the industry. So, when I got the messages about Ys, I simply felt happy and realized I had become a music composer for the first time. Nick Dwyer I’m going to play a track right now. We’re going to jump forward only a year or two and it must be mentioned all the music you were making for Ys, and Scenarios were for the PC-8801. So, PC-8801 titles but then a couple of years later you composed your first soundtrack for Sega’s console the Mega Drive [Sega Genesis]. (music: Yuzo Koshiro – “The Shinobi”) So, a couple of things that are really interesting about that. When you composed that music, you were only 21 or 22 years old and you had been working for this games company called Nihon Falcom. You were young; I guess at the time you probably thought it was the dream job. But you did something that no other video game composer did in Japan at the time which was, you quit and became a freelancer. Why did you quit Nihon Falcom? Yuzo Koshiro It is a difficult question to answer. I was young and maybe... I don’t remember well, but I guess I wanted to get more money. I was working as a part-time worker at the company, and did not get paid so much. So, I thought maybe a freelancer would get more jobs and... Consequently, more money. That’s what I was thinking at that time, maybe. Nick Dwyer So what was interesting about this is, this is the first time you made music for Sega and it was the first soundtrack that you made for the Mega Drive. How did it feel composing for Sega for the very first time? You mentioned earlier that you grew up loving the music for Sega and Sega had this reputation of, the music was very cool. And it felt very progressive, like Sega was almost like the music you’d hear on the radio, you would be hearing in Sega games. With that in mind, how did you decide your approach for the music of that game? Which was of course Shinobi. Yuzo Koshiro The reason I composed the music for Shinobi was not that I asked Mr. Hiroshi Kawaguchi, composer of Space Harrier, or Mr. Yu Suzuki, who created the music of Shenmue, for the job directly. Actually, that was different. I had many friends who were working in publishing companies because I was working for the BASIC magazine. One of them was a very good friend of the producer of Shinobi at Sega, and he invited me to meet him. The producer told me they were creating a game called Shinobi and wanted me to compose music for the game. That was how I started working on that game. As you said Nick, music of the Sega games was so cool. I liked it so much as I said before. So, it was like a dream come true for me to be part of the team. So, I said, “Yes, I’ll absolutely take that job.” Mega Drive had almost the same FM synthesis chips as the PC-8801, which I had been using. That’s why I didn’t have any difficulty in programming my compositions. So, not only Sega was the company I adored, but also the sound chips made the programming very easy, those are the biggest reasons I was engaged in the music for Shinobi. Nick Dwyer And your tastes during this time were changing a lot, right? In particular, if you listen to all of the music that you were making for these games for Nihon Falcom and then all of a sudden you go to the music from Shinobi, I mean it’s funky as hell. What changed? What happened in your life? Where did these new influences come from? Yuzo Koshiro As I mentioned a little earlier, that jazz fusion, rock or pop were the mainstream for game music in Japan. I really loved them, but gradually I started wanting to compose original songs. I thought if I added Japanese sensibility to the music of Shinobi, it would be very original as the game was set in Japan. That was my challenge and I completely changed the type of music used. That was the first step. At that time, when it came to game music, it was rock, pop and fusion. I wanted to change that trend. Nick Dwyer And then around this time you travelled to the USA for the very first time. Tell us about that trip and how much of a... Did that trip really start to open you up to a world of new influences? Yuzo Koshiro I traveled to Los Angeles, and why I went there was that I simply wanted to go to the United States. I went there not because I wanted to learn English, but I just went there because I just felt like going. I didn’t join any sightseeing tours, so, I got on the plane as other tourists did. I had to start my trip with looking for a hotel. So, I made a phone call and booked a room, like a backpacker. I was doing such things. Then, while watching an MTV program on TV in my hotel, I happened to watch the music videos and realized they were quite different from the music in Japan. I mean, they were so cool. That was the first thing that influenced me so much. Then, I started to think how I could merge this music into my songs, how I could change the trend. My trip to Los Angeles was the opportunity to shift my direction. Nick Dwyer And I guess some of the results of these new experiments was this here. This was something taken from a soundtrack which I am pretty sure everyone in the room knows. This is something from the very first soundtrack to a game in Japan which is called Bare Knuckle which of course outside of Japan we know as Streets of Rage. (music: Yuzo Koshiro – “Bare Knuckle”) When you just take a moment, I know that you’ve been listening to that track again a lot in recent times but just when you listen to it in this sort of setting and you cast your mind back to the time that you created it. What do you think of when you hear that track? What does it remind you of? Yuzo Koshiro As I was influenced by the music I heard in Los Angeles, I tried to listen to music like house or techno as much as I could when I was there. Then, I tried to compose a song with the sensibility of those kinds of music, and I composed Streets of Rage. I feel a little bit of shame, but I was so influenced by house or techno music which were in fashion at that time, maybe some of you have noticed, when you listen to the beats, but the band Enigma was the music trend of that time. Their music adopted those rhythms and it sounded very effective. The rhythm is called “ground beat,” and it was so new to me. That’s why I thought, “I’m gonna use it for my song.” And that’s how I composed Streets of Rage. There are a lot of other songs which include the sensibilities of techno or house in the tracks of Streets of Rage. Nick Dwyer What do you think it is about that music that has continued to live on? You know, especially in the last year. I’ve seen nightclubs that are full of people chanting the main riff to that and it has a massive impact on people. Why? What do you think it is about that music? Yuzo Koshiro Well, I felt very happy about that. For instance, in Japan, when a song from Streets of Rage is played, they don’t dance or sing like this as they are very shy. However, people in Europe or the US dance and sing so much and it makes me feel so, so happy. So, please sing my songs tonight if you would like to. Nick Dwyer Could you ever have imagined when you were sitting in that studio making that track 26 years ago, could you ever have imagined... What, no, it’s 28 years ago… that this music will be played, you know, in years to come? Yuzo Koshiro No, I had never imagined this was gonna happen. Never. Nick Dwyer When you made that music for a game, to put things into perspective, at the time, you know, scrolling beat ’em ups were very popular. There were a lot of waves within the history of video games. There’ll be a maze game and then everyone does a maze game and then there’ll be a shooting game and everybody does a shooting game. And all of a sudden there was an era just before the two-player beat ’em up. There was a scrolling beat ’em up and you had games like Final Fight and of course Double Dragon and they had these kind of Rocky soundtracks. But then the bosses at Sega say to you, “Yuzo, we got a new side-scrolling beat ’em up that’s going to rival Final Fight. We need something to beat Final Fight. It’s called Streets of Rage. We want you to do the music.” And you say, “I’m going to put club music into this game. I’m going to give this fighting game house and techno,” which had never been done before. How did the bosses at Sega respond to you wanting to put house and techno into the game? Yuzo Koshiro I don’t remember about it well, but house or techno music had never been used for game music before, but people at Sega were very flexible and nobody complained or opposed after listening to the songs I composed for them. On the contrary, they showed a positive attitude. They liked it. I guess they thought it very new. Nick Dwyer What were you imagining though, when you were sitting in your studio making this music? What were you thinking about? Were you thinking about the player and what you were wanting the player to feel as they experience playing this game, listening to the music that you were making? How did you want the player to feel? Sorry, were you imagining an audience in Japan or were you imagining the audience in America? What were you thinking about when you were making that music? Yuzo Koshiro Now I understood. Thank you. First of all, I need to explain this. The Sega Mega Drive or Master System were not a big hit in Japan. They were very popular in the US and Europe. The situation is the same with Shinobi and Streets of Rage. I mean, the Sega games sold more in foreign countries than in Japan. So, when I composed it, I expected that the game music fans in US or Europe would like it more than the Japanese game music listeners or fans. Nick Dwyer It must be noted as well that at this point in time you had started your own video games company. A company called Ancient. What was Ancient? And what did you want Ancient to be? What kind of company did you want Ancient to be? Yuzo Koshiro This is also a difficult story to explain, but my company, which is named Ancient, is considered as a music company by many people as I am a music composer. However, this is not true. I set it up for creating games. Now, why I set up this company? It’s because I was asked to create a Master System version for Sonic the Hedgehog at the time. One of my acquaintances asked me to work with my friends who are very talented programmers to create a Master System version for Sonic the Hedgehog. He needed to sign a contract with a company not an individual, so, he asked me to establish a company. That’s what Sega asked me. So, I set up my company to work on Sonic the Hedgehog. That’s the reason. Nick Dwyer And I think not many people in the audience might realize this but Bare Knuckle/Streets of Rage 1 was a huge success and whether you had the feedback or not, the soundtrack was incredibly well received. But obviously Sega asked you back to compose music for the second game. But, yeah, what people might not realize is that your company, Ancient, actually made the game. Tell us about this. So Ancient made Streets of Rage 2. How does that work? Yuzo Koshiro The Master System and Game Gear versions of Sonic the Hedgehog were a big hit and sold so much. So, Sega knew that Ancient had the capacity to create games, so they asked my company to create both the game and music for Streets of Rage 2. For Streets of Rage, I composed the music only. I love the beat ’em up type of games like Streets of Rage, so, I said I would love to work on them. Nick Dwyer And it must be noted that one of your employees was a gentleman that’s sitting in the audience right now, that goes by the name of Motohiro Kawashima. Kawashima-san! Konnichiwa. Welcome! And at a certain point, Kawashima-san was working at the company and you decided to ask Kawashima-san to contribute some music for Streets of Rage 2. Now you were both really diving into house and techno at the time in Tokyo. Can you tell us about what you would do outside of the office? So, on the weekends where would you go? What clubs would you go to and how exciting were the clubs? First of all Kawashima-san, konnichiwa. Motohiro Kawashima Hello. If you ask me what we were doing in our time off, I can roughly say that we used to go to nightclubs. I was an employee for the company, employee for Ancient, but I used to go out every night with Koshiro, like friends. When I listened to the music of Streets of Rage, the sounds were those of house music. The heavy bass was so good, but I thought there would be other genres where bass would be more effective. So, I invited him to go to many nightclubs to listen to drum & bass and Detroit techno. Then, he found it very interesting and responded so positively. That’s how we decided to use club music for the upcoming projects. Nick Dwyer Yuzo-san, can you describe the feeling of being that age and being in the nightclubs in Tokyo at the time, because club culture was new, wasn’t it? It was a new thing and you had these amazing clubs. Did it feel exciting to be going to these nightclubs and hearing this new music? Yuzo Koshiro I used to love listening to the new music and dance at nightclubs. I went to so many nightclubs, and there we listened and danced to the music, and you know, there were many girls there. We didn’t have good results with that. I feel shy to say this, but we used to do that at the time. Nick Dwyer And so you dance all night, you’d hear this incredible new music, like these incredible DJs that would come to Tokyo. Especially there were nightclubs like Yellow in Nishi-Azabu and a lot of the DJs from Detroit would come over, from Chicago. And would you guys, literally, after you left the club, go back home to the studio and try and recreate the music you were hearing in the clubs? Motohiro Kawashima Well, we were so excited when we were going to the nightclubs. Right after we had a shower of music, we started to compose music. That’s the thing we enjoyed doing. We were always trying to find new genres of music we could introduce to games. We found that really exciting. For instance, when we heard drum & bass, we tried to integrate the sound in game music. But the problem was that there were limitations to composing game music, like the necessity to use sampling or time limitations. So, we discussed and tried to create sounds like drum & bass within the limitations of game music composition. We tried so many kinds of music. For instance, we tried to implement the music of Underground Resistance, or other genres and bands, like Primal Scream or abstract or alternative music. Nick Dwyer I’m going to play a track right now from Streets of Rage 2. By the way if anyone has a question, we will be opening it up for all of your questions very soon as well. This is a track called “Go Straight.” (music: Yuzo Koshiro – “Go Straight”) I guess it’s worth asking this question at this point in time because if anyone else is familiar with all of the other music that was being released for the games for the Mega Drive at that time, nothing sounds like that. And I guess I need to ask you. How on earth did you make your music for the video game sound like that? Yuzo Koshiro When it comes to the songs of Streets of Rage, I always wanted to compose based on the new dance music. When I composed Streets of Rage 2, I was more influenced by dance music than when I composed the first game. So, I was trying so hard to reproduce these sounds in the game music. Streets of Rage 2 has many songs I like most from the Streets of Rage series. Actually, when I listen to them now, I find them very nice. Nick Dwyer I think it’s worth asking at this point: What exactly is a sound driver? Because that’s the one thing that a lot of people might not realize, is that a lot of composers had certain advantages over each other because they’d create their own unique sound drivers and you not only, from a very early age, were creating your own sound drivers but also your own programming languages. Am I correct? Explain to us a bit about the tools that you created yourself to make your music sound like that. Yuzo Koshiro As Nick explained now, I not only composed music, but also did programming after I studied it. In those days, there were almost no music composers who knew computer programming. So, what I was trying to do first was to create sounds through programming that nobody had created before. That was my motivation for music. I mean, I was not trying to create the sounds I wanted, but I was trying to program on the computer to create sounds. It was really important for me to create music drivers or sound drivers in my challenge to compose music. Nick Dwyer You even made your own programming language. I believe it was called Music Love. Yuzo Koshiro That’s right. I developed and used to sell a programming language called Music Love, and I was composing music using that driver. It made me program so freely with no limitations so, I could create many songs that had never been heard before. Nick Dwyer I’m just going to play something right now, we will go to questions very soon. But I think what’s very interesting about this period, I think when we’re talking about this point in time, a lot of people are familiar with your work for Streets of Rage, for Bare Knuckle and they understand that there’s a point in time where you were going to nightclubs and you were listening to all of these new influences from the nightclubs in house and techno. But at the very same time that you’re making that soundtrack, you’re also making this, which was released on the Super Famicom about 1990. And it’s a game called ActRaiser. This is a track called “Fillmore.” (music: Track from ActRaiser BGM) Just for disclosure, I played the wrong track there. I was going to play something else but that was another track off ActRaiser. But the thing about it that’s interesting is that that soundtrack is… It’s you kind of trying to create orchestral music with the Super Famicom. So, at the same time as you’re making Streets of Rage, you’re also trying to make orchestral music with the Super Famicom sound too. You had very diverse tastes at that point in time, didn’t you? Yuzo Koshiro Yes, that is correct. I love to compose music without regard for genres. Moreover, the reason I wrote music for ActRaiser in that way was the PCM [pulse-code modulation] that was available for the Super Famicom. It enabled you to do sampling. So, it was possible to reproduce real sounds which could not be reproduced from an FM sound source, like, strings. In that sense, it was a dream come true and something so natural that I composed orchestra sounds for the Super Famicom. Nick Dwyer Is it true that Nobuo Uematsu, who of course everyone will know as the composer for Final Fantasy, he had composed the music for Final Fantasy 3 or 4 – I believe it was for 4 – and then he heard ActRaiser and his mind was blown. And he was like, “Wow, I can’t believe you can do this with the Super Famicom.” And then he completely changed his soundtrack because of that. Is that a true story? Yuzo Koshiro Yes, it’s true. As Nick said, Mr. Uematsu heard the soundtrack for ActRaiser, he was so surprised. He was composing the soundtrack for Final Fantasy 4 at that time, and he decided to rework it. Not everything, but he changed the tones of the PCM sound completely. That’s what I was told. Here is an interesting story. He grew a beach at the time because after he was so surprised by the sound of ActRaiser he decided not to shave it until he could create sounds like those in ActRaiser. That’s why he grew a long beard. He liked how he looked with his beard. Since then, his beard became his style. Nick Dwyer I’m going to play this track, the correct track quickly right now. Something from ActRaiser. (music: Yuzo Koshiro – “Fillmore”) I mean, one of the things that must be noted is that obviously, today we’ve been focusing on just very, very small sections of your career and obviously you continue to make music today for video game soundtracks. But going back to this period in time where every few years a new piece of technology was coming out, and you would create music in a different way and create different kinds of music. You were working within limitations but you would figure out ways to push those limitations to the limits. When you think about that era, what did you enjoy the most about that, making video game music during this era? Yuzo Koshiro The question is about how I was composing within the limitations, right? I am different from other music composers in the sense that I composed music for the first time using my computer, the PC-8801. I think that could handle only six notes. And it was nothing unusual for me. So, I had never taken it as a limitation. Take ActRaiser for instance. This song has eight PCMs. Compared with the PC-8801, for me, its limitation is almost nothing. I have almost never felt the limitations. So, a common music composer would think of it as a limitation, but I always enjoyed composing music without having limitations at all. Nick Dwyer One thing I would love to ask is, you have a very, very broad range of music that you have created for video games, be it classical, be it house and techno, be it reggae, calypso even, over the years. Have you ever thought about making music as an artist and releasing music the way musicians do? Music not for a video game. Yuzo Koshiro I’ve never thought of releasing music other than game music as an artist. I love composing game music, and have never thought about making a band, inviting a singer, and playing music with them. Never. I like to listen to that kind of music, but putting together a band like that is completely out of my thoughts. Nick Dwyer I’ll tell you what, before we round things off, I think it’s a good time now to throw it over to any questions anybody has. Does anyone have any questions for Mr. Koshiro? Audience Member Yeah, I don’t know if you’re allowed to talk about the Streets of Rage 4 if you’re involved in it somehow. I hope. I hope that you are. But just speaking hypothetically, if you were to make the music for that game, would you like try to recreate that same type of sound from the previous games, or would you do something completely new and different? And if you saw the trailer for the game, what are your thoughts on the game? How do you think it looks? Yuzo Koshiro If I were to be involved in Streets of Rage 4, I would create a sound like... Well, when I created the sounds of Streets of Rage, I was trying to implement the newest dance music of the time. If a new Streets of Rage is released, and I am involved in it, I would think the same. I mean, I am always trying new sounds, so I would not create sounds like those of the ’90s when it was first released. Nick Dwyer Is there another question? Audience Member Hi! What’s your five most favorite composed songs that you made; like, if there are five that you hold dear and you’re very proud of making. Yuzo Koshiro Music track or composer? Audience Member Yeah, something you made. Yuzo Koshiro My songs? The five songs I like the most. Nick Dwyer Five favorite children. Yuzo Koshiro Currently, I am composing songs for a series called Etrian Odyssey. I love all the music composed for that series, but if I need to pick five, the best three songs will be from that series. I can’t easily name specifically which ones, but let me say I like Etrian Odyssey 5 best, then Etrian Odyssey 4 is next, and then Etrian Odyssey 3. They are the best three. It’s hard for me to rank them. I have composed so many other game soundtracks, and there is a game called Wangan Midnight, and I like its sound very much. I like the songs of the Wangan Midnight series as much as these best three songs. Wangan Midnight 6 is the newest one of that series, and two of them would be my favorite as well. Nick Dwyer Is there another question? Audience Member Hi. You were talking about when you started your music, you programmed a bit by yourself and nowadays I guess you maybe use different programs with interfaces and such. How has the technology in how to make music affected the way you produce music? Or your mindset maybe? You started programming but now today maybe you use a music program instead of doing it manually, everything, you know? Yuzo Koshiro Oh, I see. OK. Let’s see. What kind of changes it has made... Well, how can I explain this... It’s not a difficult question to answer, but... I don’t know, but I am thinking how to explain... As I said before, I was doing my programming using my computer the PC-8801 for about ten years. Then, I changed to a Macintosh, by Apple, and used that for five or six years to compose music. After that, from 2000 or 1999, I have been using a Windows computer. Since then, I have been using Cubase. Did I answer your question? Is my answer fine? Nick Dwyer And by the way, if anyone is too shy to ask now, you can have an opportunity to speak with Yuzo and Motohiro as well after the lecture is finished. I think we are running out of time. And I think what was just asked before is a good thing to kind of bring it back to what we’ve been discussing a lot over the course of the last couple of hours. This music that you especially created during these eras that we came through, was from very, very... In the beginning it was very rudimentary tools to create this sound and then as we were saying each new console would present a new sound chip. And a new sound chip had certain new challenges but I’m sure there was an excitement in understanding how the chip worked and thinking, “How can I make the best music possible with this new piece of technology?” Obviously when Redbook Audio [CD-ROMs with background music recorded and played back as audio, instead of being generated by the hardware] came out these limitations started to disappear and now you make video game music in the same way regular musicians would make music. But with that in mind are there still challenges? [Is it still the case that] every day you find new ways to be excited and to challenge yourself for video game music? Yuzo Koshiro Yes. I did and am still studying so hard to compose music in order to create new sounds and entertain people. I have never changed the way I work. I don’t care about whether or not there are limitations. Nick Dwyer Yuzo, what do you love about making video game music? It’s been 32 years now that you wake up every day almost and you make music for a video game. What do you love about making music for video games? Yuzo Koshiro Well, I like game music and I like playing games even more. So, when I work, I always think of game players, how I can make them more excited. So, what I think about most when I compose game music is that, and it is different from other types of music. I try to create the music that perfectly fits to the game played. Nick Dwyer Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please put your hands together for Yuzo Koshiro. [applause]

Title: The Bug
Date: 2019-05-07
URL: https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/the-bug-soundsystem/

The Bug
Kevin Martin might be best known today as the Bug, but his prolific music career extends far beyond this one moniker. Over the last 20 years, projects such as GOD, Techno Animal and Ice (all with Godflesh’s Justin Broadrick), King Midas Sound (alongside Roger Robinson and Kiki Hitomi) and some of his latest work with Miss Red and Dylan Carlson of Earth have seen Martin assimilate myriad musical styles – dub, reggae, punk, jazz, hip-hop, dancehall and dubstep, to name a few – and transform them into something truly unique. The one constant across his expansive output is weight: a weight of volume, of bass, of emotion. It’s an approach and a philosophy that’s informed just as much by punk as it is by the legendary London soundsystems of Jah Shaka and Aba Shanti-I.
In this lecture at the Red Bull Music Festival Istanbul 2018, Martin sat down with Emma Warren to discuss his inspirations, his thoughts on the music industry and how, after ten years, he’s finally unleashed his custom-built soundsystem on the world.
Hosted by Emma Warren A very big welcome please, the Bug. [applause] The Bug Thank you. Thank you. Good to be here. Emma Warren So I hear on the grapevine that you have drained all of the subs in Istanbul for the show tonight. Is this true, and what can we expect? The Bug There’s actually not enough to be honest, for what we normally ask for. The original amount of speakers that were being allocated to this event just wasn’t enough for what my personal requirements are. On my contract and rider, it generally asks for a specific amount of bassbins which are generally more than a venue will normally provide, just because for me, the impact of my music should really mirror the impact of having a deep-body massage. And having first moved to London and having discovered the joys of Jah Shaka, Iration Steppas, Aba Shanti-I, reggae soundsystem events; and unfortunately a lot of clubs you play just think you’re a lunatic when you ask for more bass, more bass. And for sure I’m addicted to bass and volume. I’m not deaf, I just love the visceral physicality of sound. I want to feel the music deeply and I like it to be loud enough that people can’t use my shows as background music to their conversations. A big problem for me with music generally now is that music’s becoming secondary to people’s lives, it’s becoming an accessory to people’s lifestyles, and for me, music changed my life. Music generally is capable of amazing things, physically and psychologically, and I just think that the more music becomes relegated to a cheap accessory, the less people will realize there’s great magic in music as a form. Emma Warren And how does volume make people realize that there is magic in music and it should be at the front of your life, not as an accessory? The Bug When I started my music career I probably just wanted to use volume as a sadistic tool to make people suffer, because I was suffering at the time and I needed an outlet. I’d probably have said that I was happiest when I was clearing rooms. I was quite happy to clear rooms, without a doubt. That was a victory when I started making music. But subsequently my whole... Obviously having made music for a fair amount of years now, my ambition for what I want to achieve with shows has changed. And I think that... I’m no hippie, but I believe in music as a transcendental power, that it can take you out of yourself. For me I stopped taking drugs and drinking many years ago because I felt that there was other ways to achieve those mental states and physical states, and I actually think music can do that, and does do that. And, for me, I can get high as a kite off music, and I can love feeling an avalanche of sound. It feels like an experience I can’t get anywhere else or in any other manner, that fulfils that sheer density of impact on my central nervous system, and I think you can achieve mental states through sound that you can’t achieve in other ways. So for me, it’s just to give people an experience that we used to talk about in King Midas Sound with Roger and I. I think it was DJ Premier, of all people, that said that music should shock, excite and amaze. And I feel now that music doesn’t sell, really, at all, that what does sell is an experience, and you want people to evangelize for you, and to spread the word. For sure, some people at venues that I pull into, or members of audiences that I’ve performed to, probably think I’m borderline insane for playing at the volume levels I play at. But it’s not a sadistic thing, it’s the opposite. The reason I care so much and put so much effort into sound checks and having a very precise rider, is because I feel people have paid to come and see a performance by the Bug, or whichever configuration I’m performing in, and I want to give them the best possible experience I can, that will hopefully change them a little bit, or change their perceptions. However anyone wants to react, is up to them, but fundamentally, I know the music shows that I enjoyed most I would talk about for weeks afterwards, and would literally change my way of thinking somehow about life, music, sound, etc. etc. Emma Warren So you’re talking about a show that you’re going to be doing in there tonight. Can you tell us who you’ve brought with you on stage, and also behind the scenes. The Bug Yeah, for this show in particular, I’m working with Miss Red. Miss Red is an Israeli MC I’ve been working with since... I think she was 19, when she stole the mic at a show I played in Israel. Emma Warren Always a good manoeuvre. The Bug Literally. And then, another really integral part of my touring experience is my secret weapon, who’s called Goh Nakada, who’s like a little brother to me. He shares a lot of the same aesthetics in music, and he’s my sound man. Not many electronic artists travel with their own sound men. But for me, he’s a crucial, crucial part of our setup. A) because he’s a dub head. He knows how to dub out Miss Red’s vocals in the way I would in the studio. B) technically he’s incredible. He’s very conscientious. He takes his job seriously, and he knows the levels of physicality that I want to achieve because he and I share very similar musical tastes. Also he’s Japanese and he plays the card of, “Sorry I don’t speak the language,” when people are interfering with him and his job. And also it’s just good to know there’s someone out there who will know what the balance should be. I made the decision to have sound men tour with me because I’d be playing shows where people would say either they couldn’t hear the vocals, or the music wasn’t loud enough, or it was just weak in some way. And like I said, I think people pay for a concert and deserve the best that they can get. For me it’s a position of trust and I know I can trust Goh implicitly because his tastes and mine are so aligned. Emma Warren So there’s a research unit in London, at Goldsmiths University, called the Bass Culture Research Unit, and they did this brilliant event recently which was celebrating soundsystem culture, and one of the people speaking was the sound man for one of the major South London soundsystems. And he talked about the stringing up and the taking down of his soundsystem, the putting together of it at a dance and the taking down of it, and how he took extreme care with every part of that process and that was why his sound sounded better than everyone else’s. Do you have a sound man who looks after your own soundsystem? Or is that Goh’s job as well? The Bug No, it’s me and Goh. We both do. I mean Go is more technical than I am, without a shadow of a doubt. But we both have to lift very heavy boxes and have been injured in the process many times. Emma Warren So tell us about your soundsystem though. Because you have your own rig, don’t you? The Bug Yeah. Emma Warren And this is not a very common thing. The Bug No, it’s not very common at all. I had signed the record deal with a major label called Warner Brothers to deliver a record under the name, Ice. And that album was specifically meant to be a project where I would be working with people who I knew I couldn’t tour with. People like El-P from Run the Jewels, was on the record. Blixa Bargeld from Einstürzende Neubauten was on the record. Antipop Consortium, members of New Kingdom. Just a lot of people I admired, mostly as vocalists. And I wanted to make this very futuristic hip-hop record that mixed live playing from the band that I’d formed with members of GOD and Godflesh, with MCs that I’d become totally smitten by. And it got signed by Kevin Shields’ sister, Ann-Marie Shields, who was a friend... Emma Warren My Bloody Valentine. The Bug Yeah. Who was a friend at the time. And the demos she heard that she signed us for were very different to what they got as a record at the end of the process. And halfway through the process, I was sort of losing the plot a bit really, and the direction of the record... Because I was becoming more and more obsessed with a lot of sound design software, like GRM Tools sound design software, and just getting more and more distanced from the original parts that I’d been working on. And also going through a lot of social problems at the time as well, which just made me very insecure. And it basically meant that I just wanted to dump what we’d originally done and... Or mash it up unrecognizably. And I think the label sensed that something was going wrong, which is my head. And they were trying desperately to get the music finished and out, that they’d invested in. And they said, “OK, we’ve paid you half the advance, how are you going to tour this record?” And I was like, “Yo, this was never meant to be toured. That was never part of the deal.” And they basically said, “Well, if you don’t tour, we’re not going to give you the rest of the money.” And I was broke. The last thing I wanted to hear was that. So I had to come up with a very quick fix. And I just came up with an idea that I didn’t think they’d go for. And I basically said, “OK, it’s impossible to tour with these guys, but I’ll tour as a soundsystem, but then you have to give me an extra ten grand to buy a soundsystem. And they did it. [laughs] I’d become good friends with Russ Bell-Brown from a soundsystem called The Disciples. And they used to provide tunes for Shaka. Jah Shaka. And I asked for Russ’s help to design a soundsystem. I didn’t know anything about soundsystems, other than I liked getting floored by them. And Russ basically took me to all these backstreet garages in places like South End, where these crusty rastas would be building speaker boxes for the dub community in London. And Warner Brothers were paying for it, which was kind of them. And by the time they’d paid and the soundsystem was built, I’d finished the record. The label hated the record. I only ever did one interview for the whole world. I hate the record. It’s the last record I ever did put vocals on. And I had a soundsystem after they dropped me. Of course it was my dream to have a soundsystem, but the reality is, you need a crew and a team around you, as you say this guy was telling you, mentioning in this bass culture research lecture you said you went to. I didn’t. I didn’t even drive. Emma Warren That definitely is a big problem in terms of transporting huge speaker boxes and a soundsystem around from place to place. The Bug So basically, I had a soundsystem in storage for years, and there’s a couple of times when I thought I’d had a few people around me that maybe we could sort it out. The last, most notably, was, I remember telling Mala and Loefah, just after I met them at FWD>>, just after FWD>> had begun, “Hey, I’ve got a soundsystem. Let’s use it.” And they were up for it, but somehow it never happened. Emma Warren So we’re talking the early days of dubstep here. These are seminal figures from that moment. I have to just say, I used to live next door to a very famous soundsystem guy called Jah Shaka, who you’ve mentioned, and he really did have a team of people to move his kit about. A van would drive up outside the house, and maybe ten or 15 dreadlocked guys in boiler suits with tools with the name Shaka sprayed on the back would come out carrying heavy things. It’s definitely a communal effort. But you use your soundsystem now for your event... Do you use that at your event in Berlin? The Bug Well, that was the thing. It’s sort of crazy that I paid storage for ten years on a soundsystem that was never used in London. I paid more in storage than I ever paid for the system, just because I wanted to keep a dream alive, and my dream was to run a rig, to run a system. When I decided to leave London, the system still hadn’t been used. By this time it’s an antiquated system, it’s very old technology. It was already DIY technology to begin with. I just remember speaking to my then-girlfriend, now-wife, and saying, “Look, what should I do? Should I bring the soundsystem to Berlin or what?” And just having the choice to try or not. And I’d spoken to a couple of people in advance of moving to Berlin to see if they could help me store it, because that’s a major issue if you have a soundsystem. Where can you put the beast? Emma Warren A big garage. The Bug Yeah. So in the end, I managed to find someone who would agree to take the system short-term, arrange for the rig to be moved... I came back to London and had friends in London who helped me, then break the rig down, put it into a van, drive it across to Berlin, into its temporary home. Still no real plan of how the hell it was going to work, practically. Just as a dream, still. Then, about a year later, I lost the storage space. Back to square one. What am I going to do? Am I going to sell this soundsystem? Am I going to keep it? Do I keep this dream alive? I had no options other than selling it, other than my last thought and straw was to call a guy that I knew that ran a club in Berlin called Gretchen, called Lars, who’s my guardian angel, actually. Because I said, “Look, Lars. I’ve got a problem. I’m going to have to sell this reggae soundsystem if I can’t find somewhere to store it. How do you fancy I store it at your club?” [laughs] He was like, “OK, how big is it?” I was, “Hard to describe. It’s ten 18" scoops.” He said, “OK, what are you doing tomorrow?” He came to see the size; said, “I can store it, but what are you going to do with it?” And I said, “I’ll run a club, if you want. I can run a club. I’ll start a club night up.” And that’s what we did. We started a club at Gretchen in Berlin, and it’s about once every three months, four months, at Gretchen, under the name Pressure. And it was just a joy. I remember the first time we finally got the rig up and running, me and Goh, because Goh’s as much of a soundsystem addict as I am, and just couldn’t believe we’re finally running it. Just one of the most important things in music for me, is its connection to your brain, dreams and creativity. I’m no Satanist, but I believe in Aleister Crowley’s philosophy of making will real and making dreams real, and I’ve managed to do that. My dream was to be a musician, since I was a kid. I had no other choice. I don’t come from an affluent background. I don’t have money. My parents didn’t have money. I didn’t have an education because I dropped out of college after I discovered music, drugs, girls. Education couldn’t compete. Therefore there was no safety net. No education, no money, no rich links. Terror, fear, anxiety and absolute passion for music has kept me going all the time. Emma Warren And in a way, those things that you describe, not having money, not having access to mainstream... Not knowing people, not having links, it’s a thing that’s common for lots of musicians all around the world. So what do you know about how you keep going when things are really tough like that? The Bug The irony is, people that think of the Bug, generally have this misconception that I must have achieved financial stability by now, which is a million lightyears from the truth. At least once a year I tremble when I look at my bank balance, because I choose to make music that’s non-conformist, uncommercial by commercial standards, personal, and right now, I feel the majority of music and the majority of the industry we’re part of dumbs its audiences down, makes cheap output for the biggest returns possible. And of course, I could make whatever music’s current, to try and jump the latest craze, wave, whatever. And there are many producers in dance music who do that, but that’s really not me. I want to live with myself, and the one thing I would say is I’m not rich financially, but I’m rich psychologically. I feel blessed in every way. I make the music I love, I love playing every show that I play. Every show is a battle with soundsystems, sound engineers, totally unpredictable in terms of how many people are going to come through the door, but I’m still even more passionate about making music now than I ever have been in my life. Emma Warren Will you play us a little something that you’re... Find something that you’ve done recently that makes you feel like that? Just a piece of music of yours which describes what you’re just talking about. While you’re looking, I have to say, I think it’s really powerful when musicians are very transparent about money. I’ve seen a few musicians recently doing this. Some of the South London jazz musicians I’m connected with back home have been starting to be public about the fact that them and their band are booked to do shows for no money, or very little money, and that they wake up in the middle of the night not sure about anything, because there’s no food in the fridge and they can’t pay their rent. This thing of not having money is perennial for musicians all over the world, and it’s good when people are honest about it, because when people are honest about it, it makes it harder for promoters to not pay people. The Bug I’m not saying that I don’t get paid okay for shows. When the shows happen, you get... By this time, I can at least... There’s a level at which I can get paid. But you notice there’s a disparity for people who make music that’s challenging compared to those people that make music that’s not a hard sell. Emma Warren What have you selected for us here? The Bug As an example of something that’s very different, in a contrarian manner, to what we’ve been talking about and what people expect from me. Just before coming here, I spent three days and nights working with a Japanese vocalist called Hatis Noit, who has got an extraordinary voice. I should’ve got some rest between coming from Armenia to come to here, for myself and my family, but when the opportunity arises to work with someone who’s so special, and in a situation where we are both inspired by each other’s music to that degree, that I was going to do that, even though it didn’t make sense to. And the results, for me, also are really important, because people have a very different opinion of what I normally do. Emma Warren Yeah, let’s have a listen. A little couple of minutes would be great.
Wow, that is very beautiful. Thank you for sharing a little thing that you’re working on. One thing that occurred to me while we were listening to that, and something that’s true, I think, of a lot of your music, is this weightiness that you have in so much of your output. We know how you add weight to the music in the performance of it, because we’ve heard you talking about your soundsystem and the fact that you have a sound man traveling with you, but how do you add so much weight to your music when you’re making it in the studio? The Bug The key is layering. Something like “Skeng,” which is the track that most people know me most for, sounds like one bassline, but it’s not just one bass. It’s about three or four layers of bass, each sculpted to complement each other to form this one massive bassline. A lot of hardware. My studio’s like a spaceship, really. And better monitoring in the end. When I first started making music, it was relatively basic, as opposed to full of bass, because of not having the tools. But I know prior to this discussion, you told me some of the things we’d probably chat about, but I have to say that even if I had a tin can and one effects pedal, I would make music. I think the tools that are most important are between your ears, and the reason for making music is what’s crucial. What sparked me into making music was punk music, because it addressed the chaos that I felt was in my life from coming from a not very pleasant family existence. I’ve heard amazing recordings by amazing artists that are so lo-fi that audiophiles would cringe. Some of my favorite producers have broken every rule in the book. I think what’s most important is just to come with a concept of why you’re doing what you’re doing and what it is you’re trying to achieve. What’s helped me more over the years is not just experimenting for the sake of experimenting, although I had to do that to get to the stage where I’m at now, but it’s just to think why you’re doing what you’re doing and what it is you’re trying to do. Particularly now, because it’s so easy to make music. There’s so many different ways to make music. There’s so many different pieces of hardware, software, where it’s become relatively much more accessible to make music than it ever has done. So now, as far as I’m concerned, it’s not about making music that’s that important to me, as the act of. What’s important is, what are you trying to do emotionally, creatively? I feel that it’s like a craft for me. It’s ended up being like a craft. I think if you’d said that to me 25 years ago, I’d say you’re insane to even talk in those terms, but actually, as times went on, I feel that it’s become a craft and an obsession to try and carve out sound with whatever tool you have, and the challenge is just how you can make it sound personal when you’re dealing with inanimate objects. [laughs] Emma Warren I mean, some of you guys might be at that point in your music-making journey, where you’re doing stuff but maybe don’t have access to a ton of kit. If you were to cast your mind back to that version of you, what would you tell that person? What do they need to remember? The Bug When I started, all I had was a saxophone and some effects pedals, and my sampler was a CD player that had an A point and a B point, and you could make loops at any stage of any CD you listened to, and the first Techno Animal record, in fact, the second one too I think, was just made up of me writing down the numbers for each tiny piece of music that I wanted to sample, and then I would go to Justin’s [Broadrick] studio in the Midlands and he would... He had a sampler, I didn’t, and he would make it into a loop. The reason I mention this is just because, where there’s a will, there’s a way. You beg, borrow, steal. I’ve done all those things [laughs] to make music because I needed to make music. It’s like I said, it goes beyond just... I didn’t make music to be famous. I couldn’t give a shit about being famous, that’s a non-entity. I didn’t do it be rich. I did it because I had to, to stay sane. My music world is almost like a parallel world to the crazy world we all have to live in, it’s my way of trying to find some form of beauty in the world, and understanding. It’s my way of translating the madness of it all, and that’s always been the case. I sometimes question it. My father was a musician, my grandfather was a musician, my mom was obsessed by music. She had speakers in every room of our house playing terrible heavy metal all the time, but it’s in me since I was a kid, and my way of escaping the sound of my parents fighting and beating each other up was to put a pair of speakers on either side of my head and just drown it all out. In a way that’s never changed; maybe I just never changed. There is no sense of progress. I think that I made music because I couldn’t, and didn’t, want to do anything else. I made a choice wherever possible, whenever possible: I didn’t want to work for anyone. I’ve never had a proper job. And my mom always said, “Music’s not a proper job, you should get a proper job.” And I’ve still never done it really. Emma Warren I remember hearing someone from New Order, obviously a huge band, talking about the same discussion with their parents, and them saying to their mum, “Oh, I can’t come around for tea on Sunday because I’ve got an interview,” meaning they were being interviewed by a journalist. And their mom was like, “Oh, thank god. What’s the interview for?” Like hoping upon hope that it was actually a job interview and that he might actually get a proper job. You just mentioned that you started off with a saxophone, you started off as a saxophone player, and I wondered: Some of you guys may be using live instruments in what you’re doing as well. Where live instrumentation sits in what you’re doing and who you’re collaborating with at the moment? The Bug The track I played you, “Sake” by Hatis Noit, she came to the studio with the guy that runs the Erased Tapes label, Rob. And we were talking about how I make music, and they were asking me how I make this X sound, Y sound or Z sound, and I wasn’t being elusive, to try and hide my secrets, I literally am happy when I can’t remember how I found the original source material. Like I said, luckily, any money I have made out of music has went straight back into music, to my studio. Of course, I’ve amassed an armory of weapons, but I try not to remember how I made something, weirdly enough. It sort of helps if you can’t recognize the source material, ’cause it gives it its own space and it gives it its own sense of mystery as well. It’s just a way of trying to strive for originality. For me, the electronic producers I like most, and generally think have achieved an ultimate goal, are the ones where you recognize their voice within 10 to twenty seconds. The guy from Dopplereffekt, today, was asking me what I thought of Aphex Twin’s new record. Richard James, you can recognize his voice quick, in sound. And that’s been my goal, is to find out what Kevin Martin’s sound is. Have I been able to translate my emotions and personality through sound. Anyone that listens to my music will probably think I’m a hideous person. [laughs] But I have, I think, managed to find a voice. The trick is how do you continue to do that without becoming a caricature of yourself, and how do you grow as an artist? That track I just played you, I don’t think I would have been able... Well, actually maybe there were tracks with Techno Animal we made in that area. But as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I think that my craft’s improved. I never feel anything I’ve made is perfect and I don’t really care about the tools that go into making them, as long as they fulfil the idea I had to begin with, before I started working on the track or the album or the single. I think it’s very important to have a vision and an aesthetic path that you’re following for any release or project that you want to be involved in, because otherwise it can just end up being a bit neutral, or just experimentation for the sake of it, or just get lost in a void of averageness. Emma Warren Have you got a little something else that you can play us around that? The Bug Yeah, I can play you... What can I play you? I can play you a track by the lady I’m going to work with tonight.
Emma Warren What do you want to tell us about that? What can you tell us about that? The Bug I think Miss Red is a freak like me. I think, when I met her in Israel, I can’t say in any single iota of my brain, I would think that I would meet a dancehall MC in Israel who was part of a crew of ’80s-dancehall-obsessed MCs, and I loved the randomness of that. I like the fact, particularly right now, when there’s many debates about gender and identity in music, that unpredictability can be so vital in music. And I like the fact that Sharon, who is Miss Red, goes against the grain. When I first worked with her, I mean I first worked with her because she literally tapped me on the shoulder at a show that I wasn’t meant to play and asked to grab a mic that I didn’t even know was there. And I was skeptical, in all honesty, as I am if anyone asks to grab a mic. You just don’t know what’s going to happen, if it’s going to be embarrassing, and if you just want to make a quick exit. And she blew my head off straight away within the first track, ’cause it was the voice and tone that I’d been looking to work with anyway. ’Cause I had wanted to work with Stush for a long time, and that had never happened. Because she’s in the high register, I don’t have to make any compromise. She can sit up there and dominate, because I’ve got all the rest to play with. And just out of sheer enthusiasm, at the end of the show, people were bouncing off walls. I think we even managed to smash a window in the venue with the bass, but the owners of the tiny venue we played were loving it all, ’cause there were people dancing on chairs, on tables, on top of each other, it was a mental scene. And I was on such a high afterwards. I said, “Look, my flight is at 2 PM in the afternoon.” And I’m saying this to her at 4 or 5 AM, “If I can find a studio, do you want to get into a studio and record?” ’Cause life can be short, it can be long, you just never know what’s around the corner. She agreed to, then I had to hassle anyone at the venue, and the promoters that had brought me to Israel, to see if they could find a studio in time, before I’d have to catch a plane. And she had never recorded at that point, either. It was literally her first proper recording. She arrived still drunk from the show and it was wicked and it was released. I then released it on my Acid Ragga label through Ninja Tune. And again, it just validates what I was saying regarding... I’d been looking for a voice like that anyway. She found me through hearing the Bug was playing in town but didn’t really know my music. But somehow, I do sort of believe that, in this crazy world, you can make things happen and you can just, by focusing your energies and focusing your attention, you can find what it is you’re looking for. And that can be good, and it can be bad, but I believe there’s ways and means to make things happen and try and locate magic around every corner. Emma Warren Yeah. And you know, music has a reflective surface, right? You can see things in it and you can maybe sense some kindred spirits.

Title: YoshimiO

YoshimiO
Drummer, vocalist and serial collaborator Yoshimi Yokata, AKA YoshimiO, has been an inescapable presence in the Japanese and international experimental rock and avant-garde scene for over 30 years. Hailing from Okayama, YoshimiO began her career in 1986 with the band U.F.O or Die, a side project of experimental vocalist Yamatsuka Eye, before joining Eye’s Boredoms a year later and eventually becoming one of its longest serving members. She began releasing music under the name Yoshimi P-We (now YoshimiO) in 1993, all the while collaborating across various projects, including the experimental ensemble OOIOO; the Saicobab quartet, which fuses Indian raga traditions with punk and electronic music; and with international musicians including Kim Gordon, Mats Gustafsson, Susie Ibarra and Robert Lowe. While best known as a drummer and vocalist, Yokata also plays the trumpet and keyboard, and often works in improvisational contexts.
YoshimiO sat down with Masaaki Hara at the Cerulean Tower’s Noh Theatre for a rare public lecture as part of the Red Bull Music Festival Tokyo 2019, during which she revisited key moments in her career and discussed her approach to collaboration, musical training and performance.
Hosted by Masaaki Hara OK, let’s get the lecture started. So once again, our speaker, who has a concert coming up soon, is YoshimiO. Another round of applause, please. YoshimiO Pleased to meet you. [applause] Masaaki Hara And I’m your interviewer, Masaaki Hara. It’s pretty rare, almost unheard of, to do a lecture after a show. YoshimiO I actually don’t know. Masaaki Hara What’s more, here we are sitting on tatami, on a Noh stage. It’s pretty surreal. YoshimiO Pretty far out of the norm. Masaaki Hara It’s really rare. Kind of once in a lifetime. YoshimiO Let’s make it that way. [laughs] Masaaki Hara So today... I’d like to speak mainly about the things you’ve done, what you’ve accomplished and your creative endeavors. I think most of the people here know you from the Boredoms and OOIOO, so we’re taking that as a given. But there’s also your solo work, your collaborations with other artists like Saicobab here today. You’ve been doing projects like that the entire time, so we’re hoping you can look back over these and share some stories with us as we listen to some of the music. That’s the gist of it. YoshimiO OK, got it. Masaaki Hara So we’re going to be playing some recordings here, and we’d like to hear your thoughts on them. We’ll go over things in chronological order if that’s okay. I wonder if it’s okay to play one like this right off the bat [points to playlist on computer]. Maybe that wasn’t a good way of putting it. YoshimiO You still said it! That’s how it is. Masaaki Hara This is probably one of your earliest projects, huh? YoshimiO Which one are you trying to play? Masaaki Hara This one. YoshimiO It’s a pretty rude one. Sorry. Masaaki Hara So this is from 1993. Free Kitten. YoshimiO This single is actually what led to me joining Free Kitten. Masaaki Hara Free Kitten was with someone from Sonic Youth... YoshimiO Kim Gordon, and then Julia Cafritz from Pussy Galore. Masaaki Hara And then you joined the band they started as a drummer? YoshimiO Yeah, or I guess it wasn’t so much of a band when we recorded this. Actually the name of the band was Kitten. There was a girl from another indie band called Kitten, and she asked Kim not to use the name. The names would be the same, and that’s why it became Free Kitten. I thought it was “Kitchen” the whole time. They said they were going to record and wanted me to help. I didn’t know all the details, but I went anyway and they told me to cover this song. Masaaki Hara I see. And actually it only ever came out on 7". YoshimiO This label only releases picture 7"s. Masaaki Hara Do you have a copy of it yourself? YoshimiO I think I have maybe two around the house. Masaaki Hara I don’t have a copy, and it isn’t available digitally either. YoshimiO There aren’t any records left, huh? Masaaki Hara Yeah, so I’m sorry, but this recording is from YouTube. So this is a cover of a song by the UK punk band X-Ray Spex, right? YoshimiO Yeah. Masaaki Hara So we’re going straight into it. Please check out one of Yoshimi’s earliest recordings. (music: Free Kitten – “Oh Bondage Up Yours!” / applause) YoshimiO There’s trumpet on this. Like just really blaring. And then I’m playing drums. Masaaki Hara Pretty amazing stuff. YoshimiO So with the record cover for this, I had a dominatrix friend from New York that was into bondage fashion, so one picture is with something she told me to wear. The other is with the kimono my mom gave me for my coming-of-age ceremony. So I had these two photos and gave them to Kim for her birthday. I told her that we wear kimono like this when we turn 20 here. The other S&M one had nothing to do with that but it was just something I had. Then they just used those for the cover photos, on sides A and B. The front is me as dominatrix and the back is me in a kimono. My mom was the only one who liked seeing the kimono photo spinning on the turntable. They got me really good with that single. Masaaki Hara It’s a really rare recording from your early years. Was this before you were doing Boredoms? YoshimiO I think I was already in the band. Oh yeah, I was. Boredoms and Sonic Youth did a tour together in ’92. I visited the house Thurston and Kim were staying at back then, I remember they grabbed me, each by an arm, and dragged me into the studio. Masaaki Hara And they forced you to record? YoshimiO Yeah, they were like, “Copy this right now.” Masaaki Hara So, was the actual recording for this first? [points to laptop playlist] UFO or Die. YoshimiO I think so, but... Masaaki Hara We have another recording from your early career. YoshimiO I don’t remember. It’s all a bit fuzzy. Masaaki Hara This says it was recorded between ’92 and ’93. Maybe before? YoshimiO I guess that’s what it must be then. Masaaki Hara It was released in 1996. As part of the album Cassette Tape Superstar. Do you remember? YoshimiO Oh yeah, of course. It’s got some wild art by Eye on it. Masaaki Hara Yeah, it’s a pretty intense cover. YoshimiO This is our sink. Masaaki Hara Then there’s a record with stuff written all over it. It has 23 tracks. YoshimiO This was a famous one, though. I really want to hear it, but maybe it’s too much? Masaaki Hara No way, let’s play it! There’s one track where you really hammer the drums. Here’s one song from the album called “We Are Rice.” (music: UFO or Die – “We Are Rice” / applause) YoshimiO Glad that’s over with. Masaaki Hara Do you remember the making of this song? YoshimiO This was recorded in a room at our house with an MTR [mastering tape recorder] or something. Masaaki Hara I guess it was still the era of tapes. YoshimiO The sound quality is great since it was all on tape. Masaaki Hara So, when did you first start playing drums? YoshimiO I think UFO or Die was probably when I started. I just did it because I was told to, so I didn’t have a clue what I was doing. Masaaki Hara So you weren’t taught. YoshimiO No. Drums make a sound just by hitting them, so that’s what I did. Back in those days we were doing lots of Battle of the Bands type shows. I’d have to play after the drummer that went before me, right? I had no idea what I needed to unscrew in order to adjust the height of the set. So if a big guy was playing before me, I’d end up playing like this [raises her arms]. Other times I’d be like, “Man, the set is so low!” Things went on like that for quite a while. I didn’t know you could take the sets apart, either. Masaaki Hara So you thought it was one piece. YoshimiO Yeah, just one big instrument. Masaaki Hara You thought they carried it around like that. YoshimiO Yeah. I didn’t know anything, like not even how to adjust the throne. I can put on heads, tune the drums and all that now, though. I thought figuring out how to work around what the previous guy did in my style was a concept that came with playing drums. Masaaki Hara When I saw Boredoms and others back in the ’90s, I thought you seemed really confident while drumming. YoshimiO In the beginning, yeah, I was like, “Hey, I’m making noise, so I must be doing it right.” Masaaki Hara It definitely seemed that way. YoshimiO I wasn’t particular about my playing. But, a contrived man-made instrument all set up like that was probably just something I found easy to use. Whatever goes. Masaaki Hara It’s the more primitive instruments that are harder. YoshimiO Yeah. I think the tones are more linked back into nature. But with like piano and so on, you’ve got these things you have to do all lined up. It’s so contrived that it’s a bit freaky. Masaaki Hara So is that why you kind of drifted towards folk or ethnic music? More primal sounds. YoshimiO I don’t really think of it as ethnic. Instruments that seem like something a god made should be played on impulse, is how I think about it. I found it easier to work that way. It makes it easier for me to get into it, I guess. And then things that feel human-made should be played in a more human manner. It’s easier for me to play the more primitive instruments if I feel like I’m channeling something while I do it. Masaaki Hara So after this you got into field recording, right? Like recording sounds from nature and using them to make music. Do the spiritual things you mentioned play into that, too? YoshimiO No, the field recording started when I happened to get ahold of a binaural mic. I wanted to capture what I was hearing. Masaaki Hara Binaural recording? YoshimiO And then I... You’re going to play it, right? Masaaki Hara Yeah. YoshimiO So I’d put the mic on, hop in the back of a light truck and just drive all around a mountain. It would be me and Yuka Honda, formerly of Cibo Matto, in the back of this truck. We made an album that way. We’d set out early in the morning, then wind our way up the mountain. The basic pattern was to record like that until evening. Then we went into the studio and mixed it all into an album. Masaaki Hara So this is from 2003, under the name Yoshimi and Yuka with the album title being Flower With No Color. YoshimiO It was on Mike Patton’s label, Ipecac. Masaaki Hara So it came out from there, and when I heard this I was kind of surprised that you made something like that. And I don’t mean that in a rude way, but just that you’d changed maybe. It feels like that was around when you started doing the things you do now. Anyway, let’s give it a listen. You recorded this on a truck. This is the last one. YoshimiO It’s from around evening time. Masaaki Hara Did you get tired of being in the truck? YoshimiO I actually get carsick pretty fast. Masaaki Hara So this is a track from back then. (music: Yoshimi and Yuka – track from Flower With No Color / applause) YoshimiO The original track stopped in the middle, really abruptly. That was the end there. The piano keeps going, though. The piano there was me. Masaaki Hara So you played piano occasionally? YoshimiO I did study it a bit as a kid. Masaaki Hara So you can play? YoshimiO I could, but part way through I started caring only about the black keys. I only played the black keys. I like them a lot. Masaaki Hara I see. I think I get what you mean. YoshimiO I like the black parts better than the white ones. Masaaki Hara This album has a kind of ambient feel to it... YoshimiO You mean overall? Masaaki Hara Yes. YoshimiO We’ve had DJs play it before. The middle tracks. Shhhhh and other guys. Actually Saicobab and C are doing a show together. At Bonobo. Shhhhh helped me remember. It’s tomorrow, so... Masaaki Hara So these past few years overseas and here in Japan, too, ambient, environmental music and new age have been pretty popular. That wasn’t really the case when you made this. It must have been new. YoshimiO I don’t know... Masaaki Hara It’s improvisational, right? YoshimiO We had this recording of a sort of audio landscape, then brought in instruments to see what we could do with it. We just picked up whatever we liked and then worked it into the piece. That’s all. We were just having fun. Masaaki Hara Well, playing around and improv are pretty tightly connected. YoshimiO This one was a lot of fun. Masaaki Hara But you’ve been making things in a kind of improvised way all along, right? YoshimiO Yeah, that’s true. Like the Boredoms Super Roots series, all of those started with us having the instruments set up and we all improvise. But since we were doing albums with jackets and stuff we compressed them down into songs. Masaaki Hara You had something bigger than a song and had to compress it. YoshimiO We had to fit it onto that small CD. Masaaki Hara Did you have a lot of session time where you went into the studio together? YoshimiO I mean, in the sense that you have to pay money to book the studio for the time, which then means you have no choice but to go that day, right? You can’t just go at will. In America and so on everyone has studios in their basements. Can’t really do that here in Japan. That’s why we worked part-time jobs to have that studio money. Masaaki Hara So it was pretty much the same as with any other people in a band. YoshimiO Exactly the same. Masaaki Hara I have to wonder again how you were able to make this in that kind of setting, though. Something that feels so freeform. YoshimiO We weren’t saying, “Let’s do this genre,” or, “Let’s do that genre.” It was all just us. So there was no other outcome. Masaaki hara After this album, you started doing solo projects where you worked with other artists. Was there some kind of turning point involved there? YoshimiO It just worked out that way. I went overseas with OOIOO, like America, New York, and while there friends would say, “Let’s do something.” Little YoshimiO collaborations, that bit by bit would become albums or live shows. With my solo projects, I’m usually the drummer, and then I’ll always have another drummer right there facing me. Then in the middle will be someone else playing a different instrument. That’s been my collaboration style. Two mountains and the moon between is the image when picking people. Masaaki Hara Two mountains and a moon. I like it. YoshimiO The two drum sets are mountains, and then in the middle is the moon. A lot of times people would suddenly wonder why they’re there, but they have to play, so they do. Masaaki Hara So how is it that you kept getting invited to do stuff while you were overseas? Everyone seemed interested in you. YoshimiO Maybe because we were friends, but I don’t really know. They just ask me to do it, and I say, “OK.” Masaaki Hara But a lot of those things you’re asked to do turn out really good. YoshimiO Yeah, maybe some of them did. Masaaki Hara I’d like to play one of them. This is from 2007, so it’s a bit further along. It’s with Mats Gustafsson. YoshimiO He’s got a band called Fire! now. Masaaki Hara He’s a sax player from Sweden, right? And his background is in free jazz, free improvisation. But he’s also done stuff with noise artists like Merzbow. YoshimiO There’s this small town in Sweden called Ystad, and for some reason they kept inviting me there. Masaaki Hara Was that with the Boredoms? YoshimiO No, solo. Just me. So Kim went, and Thurston and Jim O’Rourke were there, too. Then there was me and others like DJ Olive, so you had all these musicians together. We were all meant to do an improv show there. I did a duo with Thurston, it appeared in the newspaper in this small town of Ystad, saying, “Who needs Yoko Ono now?” Masaaki Hara That’s quite the headline! YoshimiO I was shocked. “Is that what people think of me?!” So then I did a duo with Mats because he said he wanted to do something with just him and my voice. So we went to another city called Malmö, and we played a show with about 100 metronomes. Masaaki Hara So it was like a sound installation? YoshimiO I think so. Everyone set off the metronomes at the count of three, but even if you have a hundred of them, it’s the final three, two or one that add the charm. When it’s all said and done. Masaaki Hara There was a contemporary composer named Ligeti who did something similar. With a bunch of metronomes. YoshimiO Maybe this was a follow-up on that. Using the same technique. But yeah, we played with a bunch of metronomes. Masaaki Hara So this is from Sweden, and the label is from Norway. Smalltown Supersound. A very interesting label. That’s where the recording was released. YoshimiO I didn’t know any of that. I don’t really listen to my own stuff once it’s done. Masaaki Hara You don’t? YoshimiO No, I pretty much just file and forget. Masaaki Hara But you keep copies of your work, right? YoshimiO I probably have at least one copy of this somewhere. Masaaki Hara But you don’t listen to your work. YoshimiO Not really, no. Masaaki Hara OK, well let’s listen to it now. Was this also improvised? YoshimiO Yes, completely. Masaaki Hara There’s one song that’s 20 minutes long, and then another that’s three minutes. That’s all there is. It’s a two-song album. Shall we play the three-minute one? YoshimiO So it’s a really short album. Masaaki Hara Yeah, not even 30 minutes. Shall we? I’ll play the three-minute track. (music: Mats Gustafsson and Yoshimi – “Soundless Cries With Their Arms In The Air” / applause) YoshimiO Mats made me remember, but the day after tomorrow I’m going to be doing drums with these guys Matte and Guro from Sweden in Shin-Okubo... At this placed called Earthdom. They’re Swedish, I think. Masaaki Hara What’s that all about? YoshimiO So one time I was asked to go to Singapore to play drums. The musicians I played with then were going to be doing a tour in Japan, and they wanted me to drum with them somewhere. I just happened to have an opening the day after tomorrow, so I booked it. So that’s it. Masaaki Hara Go check out Earthdom if you’re keen. YoshimiO So Matte is this female sax player and Guro is a bassist. She’s really interesting. She wraps her bass completely in tape, and then plays by ripping it off a bit at a time. Masaaki Hara I see. But you’re going to be playing drums normally? YoshimiO I don’t know if you’d call it normal, but I guess. Masaaki Hara Going back to Mats, what you guys did here was just vocals? YoshimiO That’s right. Masaaki Hara He just wanted you to sing. He liked your voice? YoshimiO I think a lot of people are particular when it comes to voices. Masaaki Hara You mean they want your voice? YoshimiO A lot of times they just want me to scream. Masaaki Hara Like what you did with the Boredoms. YoshimiO I screamed too much when I was young, though, so whereas I used to have like 70 variations, as I get older there are fewer and fewer. Sometimes a new vocal cord will open and give me 70 or 80, but they’ve really been decreasing, to where now I’ve only got like three. Masaaki Hara But you had some range tonight. YoshimiO Those weren’t screams, though. Masaaki Hara You were holding back there. YoshimiO That was singing. I wouldn’t do that at an event like tonight’s. Masaaki Hara But you’re also a vocalist, right? YoshimiO It seems that way. Ever since I started drumming, for some reason I would just start screaming. I’d sing the whole time I played. Masaaki Hara You couldn’t help but vocalize while you played. YoshimiO Right. Masaaki Hara It felt really natural. I see. I’ve always felt your vocals really made an impression, and I guess that’s why. That’s the order things work in for you. YoshimiO It’s like something comes out before I talk, before it can become words. It’s all so quick, see? They’re already in me, so I don’t need any material to work with. They come out easily. Those feelings I have inside me in the moment. Masaaki Hara Voice is the most primal instrument. Are you interested in vocals, as in more like singing? YoshimiO I do have these ongoing melodies. Masaaki Hara In your head? YoshimiO If I let those out they become the melody. That’s the kind of singing that interests me. Things where you have to do it like, “one, then two, then three,” bug me. Masaaki Hara Do you ever sing? YoshimiO I just sang a lot. Masaaki Hara Yeah you did today, but do you ever do more than that? YoshimiO I sing in OOIOO. Masaaki Hara You do. YoshimiO I sang in Boredoms, too. So I do sing a bit. Masaaki Hara Understood. It was a bad question. Let’s move on to the next selection. This next one is something you did all on your own, right? YoshimiO Yeah, that’s right. Masaaki Hara Bor Cozmik. This is your second album? YoshimiO My second solo album. Masaaki Hara So it’s your second album and... You went somewhere for it, right? YoshimiO So my family... We went to Borneo. It was during a Boredoms tour. I danced with some headhunters while I was there. When I heard a recording of it, I decided to use it for something. Then I went into the rainforest, deep into the wilderness. I also used some recordings of that. Masaaki Hara This is part of a conceptual series, correct? You were asked to make it, right? It says here that it was film director Mike Mills and the editor of a French fashion magazine. YoshimiO Helen from Purple. Masaaki Hara Yeah, the three of you were asked to make something by the brand Cosmic Wonder, which is also by a modern artist. To use a recording. Do you remember? YoshimiO Not really. Masaaki Hara I think it’s interesting that you were involved in something so conceptual. YoshimiO I don’t think that’s Bor Cozmik. Masaaki Hara Oh really? It came out in this series [points to laptop]. YoshimiO That series... Ellen from Purple did this thing called Light Source for Cosmic Wonder, and she asked me to write an essay on light. So I wrote something and then gave her a recording. The recording had Hama-chan, who was in OOIOO for a bit and played today. Hama... Audience Member Hamamoto. YoshimiO Where is he? He... Where is he? I can’t see. [waves] He played the gamelan while in OOIOO with Kohei from Taiku Jikan. I first met the two of them during that Cosmic Wonder session. We had the two of them on gamelan, and then Ai, the girl who played drums at the time in OOIOO, was on gamelan, too. The recording had me doing improvised vocals over that, and that’s what we gave to Cosmic Wonder. Masaaki Hara And that was Light Lodge? YoshimiO Yes. Masaaki Hara So this wasn’t a follow-up to that, but an entirely different solo album? YoshimiO Yeah, it was called Yunnan Colorfree. I think it was Kim Sung-Yoon... But they made a documentary showing the clothing of Yunnan Province, and I made this album as the soundtrack. Masaaki Hara Today we’re going to hear a sample from Bor Cozmik. The song is pretty long. 40 minutes. YoshimiO Yeah, it ended up that way since it was made over field recordings. Masaaki Hara It’s long, so we’ll just touch on a little bit of it. (music: YoshimiO – “Untitled” / applause) It really gives a sense of the local music. YoshimiO It’s a bit mysterious. Masaaki Hara Yeah, it is. It goes back to what you said earlier about the dissonance of academic elements over tribal music. You were avoiding that, right? YoshimiO Exactly. Kind of like how you don’t wear shoes indoors. Masaaki Hara I’m not sure if calling it “ethnic” music is right. YoshimiO Well, they were doing music from their tribe, so it’s not really a genre. Masaaki Hara I guess maybe “local music” fits better. Have you always been into non-Western music from other countries? YoshimiO I really think punk, hardcore or anything impulsive can be called tribal music. Like that Brazilian hardcore band we mentioned earlier. The recording method is really out there, and the balance is super unique. Only the vocals are really loud, with guitar just blaring like a vacuum cleaner. Then the drums are way far off. There’s something so real about it. I can just feel the drive behind it. That kind of recording style has always been a big reference for me. It’s distorted yet real. Masaaki Hara But like early hardcore bands had that drive, which then becomes a style. It turns into regular rock. YoshimiO I’m fine with that. Masaaki Hara But what you’re doing is always kind of running away from that. You’re not trying to go that way. Like you had some hardcore type stuff early on, but now it feels like you’re going in a more tribal or local direction. YoshimiO I don’t really know myself, but I guess everything, including what you mentioned, is the same inside me. Masaaki Hara So you haven’t changed in terms of how you interact with sound. YoshimiO I don’t think so. Masaaki Hara Drive is a bit difficult, though, huh? Maintaining it, I mean. YoshimiO Like even with Saicobab, things come out of my mouth before they’re even words. If I don’t create a place for me to do that, then I can’t do what I do. Masaaki Hara Like you’re thinking about controlling it? YoshimiO I do control it. Masaaki Hara So it’s not like you’re just letting yourself run free. YoshimiO I have to control myself and create a proper vessel, or else I can’t catch these things popping into me. So I live a serious life. Masaaki Hara No, I think you’re very serious. But, would it be right to call this thing of yours a technique? YoshimiO I don’t know. I have no technique when it comes to instruments. Not with drums or guitar. I still have trouble tuning a guitar. Even with a six-string guitar I still only use like one or two strings. Using all six is too much for me. I just do what I can do. And I guess every instrument looks a bit tribal when I play them that way. Masaaki Hara But there’s still people out there with crazy tuning like Arto Lindsay, right? YoshimiO Everyone has their own tuning, though, so it’s naturally going to be a bit off. The so-called proper scales or tuning were always so rigid, so I’ve never understood what people think feels good about them. It makes me feel a bit dark or down. Masaaki Hara When you hear proper tuning? Like classical or Christian music? YoshimiO They do have an influence. Scales that can drive people to war and the like. I think there may be something to it. But like a normal person says “do,” [the C musical note in French or Italian] I think it’s going to be slightly different for everyone. They call that being tone-deaf, but I don’t think there is such a thing. The only reason we have tone-deafness is that people have contrived these proper tones. Masaaki Hara So it’s that type of music with irregular tunings or rhythms, music that doesn’t follow a steady rhythm, that you feel drawn to, right? YoshimiO My ears lean that way, but I do like some precise music with proper tones. Masaaki Hara I see. You don’t make it yourself but... YoshimiO I can see how it’s great for what it is. Masaaki Hara Got it. Let’s play our next track. Up next is... This one is pretty recent. YoshimiO Yeah, very much so. I just got back from touring for this. Masaaki Hara This is you and a drummer named Susie Ibarra and... One other person. YoshimiO Robert Lowe. Masaaki Hara Is he a vocalist? YoshimiO He was a vocalist. Masaaki Hara He was in a band, right? As a bassist? YoshimiO He was in Om. Masaaki Hara I thought so. But now he does stuff with modular synths and the like. YoshimiO He works for a modular synth maker. Masaaki Hara It seems like he’s been getting some attention in noise techno circles. So it’s the three of you? YoshimiO Yeah, this is a recording of a random YoshimiO collaboration in New York. And then we started touring with it. Masaaki Hara Then an EP came out on Thrill Jockey. It’s from last year, right? YoshimiO I think so. Masaaki Hara It says 2018 here. Flower of Sulphur. YoshimiO Yunohana. Masaaki Hara Right. It says Yunohana Variations. YoshimiO Yunohana means Flower of Sulphur. Masaaki Hara Since it has variations, is it like a concerto or rhapsody? YoshimiO Rob decided that part, so I’m not sure. Masaaki Hara Got it. So would you say this is your latest recording? YoshimiO I’d say so. Masaaki Hara Let’s hear a song from it. The titles are really simple. “Aaa,” “Bbb,” “Ccc,” and “Ddd.” YoshimiO A-side, B-side, C-side, D-side. It’s a two-record album. Masaaki Hara I see. Let’s check out the A-side then. (music: YoshimiO, Susie Ibarra, Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe – “Aaa” / applause) The sound there is quite something. YoshimiO Susie was a student of Milford Graves. Masaaki Hara She’s an incredible drummer. YoshimiO She is, though she wasn’t in that clip much. Masaaki Hara That was you playing just now. YoshimiO It’s a drum set, but it doesn’t sound like one. Susie can play her drums like sand [imitates drum sounds]. All these little taps coming down, with her sticks upright making a buzz. And then I come in and put a rock in the middle of it. Like I’m pounding rice with a mallet. So we’ve got twin drummers with a combo of those two styles. And then Rob does his awesome vocals. He put a contact mic here [points to neck], hooked it up to a modular synth rig, and then ran these high vocals through it. And then there’s my voice, too. So it was twin drums, twin vocals and modular synths. Masaaki Hara That’s an interesting mix. YoshimiO I had a synth by me while I drummed that I played off and on as well. So I would play it, work the stick, and then do the hi-hat. It was a weird set. Masaaki Hara Was this live? YoshimiO Yes. Masaaki Hara We could only listen to a bit here today, but it’s a really wonderful album to listen to in a place with good acoustics. Have you tried that? The sound is great. Each of the artists stands out well, but it gives the impression of being both improvised and a composition. It just seemed like an impossible sort of performance. YoshimiO We did a UK tour, just jamming together every day for ten days. We learned each other’s trademark tricks that way, so we decided to start trying to do something outside of those routines. That made each day different. If Susie was hungry, then her music would be hungry, too. Those kinds of things started to jump right out. Like if everyone was having a chill day, then our session would be chill. It was really experimental. Like reaching the point where nothing else comes out and you’ve reached the bottom of the ravine. Just jamming together until you’re completely empty. I say “jamming” but simply playing along with each other isn’t jamming. My state at the time is going to jump to the forefront. I had to figure out how to put that in sound. And I was playing with others, so I needed to watch what they were doing, but I wanted to do something other than that, I guess. If all we did was go with the flow then all we’d be doing was copy each other. It was a really difficult tour. Recently the three of us played in America at the Big Ears Festival. Masaaki Hara And that’s where you just were? YoshimiO Right. So, in that sense each time we play together is different. Masaaki Hara I felt like this trio was a really interesting one. You’re all coming from different places, too. YoshimiO Completely different. Masaaki Hara Susie Ibarra has heritage in the Philippines. Her parents were probably immigrants from there, and then she grew up in the US. But apparently she researches indigenous music from the Philippines. YoshimiO She’s a teacher. Masaaki Hara So she’s quite academic. YoshimiO Very much so. Masaaki Hara It’s cool that you’re doing music with someone like her. YoshimiO It’s interesting that we’re so different, huh. Masaaki Hara It’s also interesting that this mix came out on Thrill Jockey, which put out things by the likes of Tortoise and Jim O’Rourke. YoshimiO This was a live recording, but it was mastered. Masaaki Hara But you’ve also put out your work with Mats on that label Smalltown Supersound. And then your solo work is on Commmons, right? Ryuichi Sakamoto’s label. Commmons has also released music by the Boredoms and OOIOO. All of the labels you put stuff out on are really interesting. YoshimiO Thrill Jockey has been releasing all the OOIOO stuff recently, though. Masaaki Hara It’s cool to see how worldwide your music is, how you’re connected with all these different interesting labels. YoshimiO I didn’t know about Mats’s label at all. Even though I’m on it. Masaaki Hara So there’s this DJ called Prins Thomas, and he released a three-disc mix for Smalltown Supersound’s 25th anniversary. It’s got a really cool mix of everything from improvised music to more traditional stuff. I think this recording was on there. YoshimiO I see. I learned something new there. Masaaki Hara Give it a listen. YoshimiO I will. Saicobab is on Thrill Jockey, too. Masaaki Hara Let’s play some Saicobab. Something we didn’t play live today. So before Saicobab there was Psycho Baba. YoshimiO Baba, right. Saicobaba was Yoshida Daikichi’s thing. Then I joined, and Saicobaba became me, this tabla player Yuzawa and Yoshida. The two of them did kind of classical stuff, and then I came slamming in from left field. Just throwing my voice in there. Singing on the songs Daikichi writes really just... It puts me into the zone, enables me to really put myself on full display. That’s why we switched to Saicobab. Saicobaba meant “psycho old lady,” but “bab” means a rebirth into the world’s oldest baby. Masaaki Hara I see. YoshimiO So we became Saicobab, but all along I’d had this desire to do a hardcore band, like grindcore. So now I’m doing this as ragacore, a raga/grindcore band. Masaaki Hara Interesting. YoshimiO I don’t think the other guys care about any of that, though. Masaaki Hara But in your mind it’s a hard raga... YoshimiO Grind ragacore. Masaaki Hara So this is also some of your newest work. YoshimiO Fairly new. Masaaki Hara It’s an album from two years ago. YoshimiO Is it? Masaaki Hara 2017 is when it dropped. I think this is the song. YoshimiO We played pretty much everything today. But we didn’t have time for this one. Masaaki Hara Yeah, you had just 40 minutes today. This is a studio recording? YoshimiO It’s studio, or more like things we all recorded at home and brought together. Everyone uses their computers now. I can’t use them well, though. Masuko from DMBQ did my recording for me. Masaaki Hara I see. OK, let’s give it a listen. (music: Saicobab Unknown Track / applause) You have sheet music with Saicobaba, right? YoshimiO You mean “bab?” Yeah, we do. Masaaki Hara I saw the members had sheet stands earlier. YoshimiO Raga doesn’t have bass in it, though, so Daikichi makes the phrases himself and we do our best to play it. Masaaki Hara But you’re kind of off... YoshimiO He does make me vocal melodies to reference, of course. There are some songs where I stick to that, and then others where I do my own thing once we’re recording. So sometimes those off-the-cuff vocals become the song. So some are like that, and some are set from the get-go. Raga is a bit too tough for me. I don’t understand any of the theory, so I just dive in with my just my sense of it. I try to keep one step ahead with my singing. Masaaki Hara You are extremely prolific. We really only showed a tip of the iceberg today. But to hear you say that you don’t listen or look back on what you’ve done, it depicts a really wonderful stance of focusing on what’s ahead. What do you plan on doing from here on? Is it okay to ask? YoshimiO It isn’t like I want to do this or that. With Saicobab, I had this longtime drive to do grind ragacore. But I’ve never been the type to say, “This is what I want to do, and this is how I’ll do it”. Masaaki Hara So all these things we checked out today came about because the other people reached out to you. They were all looking for the right person and... YoshimiO That’s how it usually went. Masaaki Hara They’d reach out to you. YoshimiO Things would just work out that way, in terms of meeting people and timing. Masaaki Hara And when the time is right, you don’t miss the chance, perhaps? YoshimiO Pretty much. Masaaki Hara I’m sure you’re going to continue to create plenty more, so I’m looking forward to it. It was kind of a quick run-through, but today we mainly played samples of your solo work and things you did with others. If anyone out there hadn’t heard any of this before, most of it is still available. You can listen to a lot of it on Spotify. It’s out there for the listening, so check it out. There are a lot of cool tracks. And since everyone came here to this lecture today, and since we have a bit of extra time, if you have some questions for Yoshimi, feel free to ask away. It’s okay, right? YoshimiO I just hope I can answer. Masaaki Hara This is your chance, so raise your hand if you have a question. Audience member I’d love to know what album has impressed you the most. YoshimiO I don’t know if it impressed me the most, but what popped into my head just now is this guy from Argentina called Mono Fontana. I was really blown away by his recording style, its depth. Audience member Thank you. For me it’s Super æ by the Boredoms. YoshimiO I hear a lot of people say that about Super æ. Sometimes overseas there’ll be old guys who will only say Super æ. I always make the same face when I meet them. Audience member I could tell from your performance today, but playing in a Noh theater like this is a pretty special set-up. And then Saicobab was playing off of sheet music. Did playing in this setting influence your set in any way today? Since it wasn’t a normal concert venue. YoshimiO It was pretty unique, but I have played at a Noh theater in the past with OOIOO, the guys who were in the Boredoms guitar orchestra at the time, and then I think it was Saicobaba. Noh stages have clay jars underneath them to help sound resonate, right? So when it comes to vocals, it feels better to just sing unaided without going through the mic. The resonance is great, so Noh stages are actually easy to perform on. The atmosphere is a bit stiff, though, so it does feel like we’ve been plucked out of our natural element and placed here. But in terms of the sound Noh theaters are easy to play. Audience member Thank you. That wasn’t quite the answer I expected. Masaaki Hara The resonance is great for even just talking. YoshimiO You don’t even need a mic really. It’s easy to hear my own voice. Masaaki Hara It’d be great to see places like this used more often. YoshimiO They just have so many rules is the thing. Masaaki Hara That can’t really be helped. YoshimiO We have to toe the line. Masaaki Hara If there’s anyone else. No one? Audience member What is the most important thing for you when making music? Or when making anything. YoshimiO I think the most important thing is doing right by yourself, I guess. Like thinking about if you look good or... When it comes to food, and I’ve been making a lot recently, like the type of curry people line up for. Masaaki Hara You’re doing a curry place? YoshimiO Curry, like South Indian style. But anyway, people are going to be swallowing what I make, eating it, so I have to take some responsibility for what I make. At any rate, if you aren’t doing yourself right, you can’t show anything to others. You have to be honest to yourself. Masaaki Hara You mentioning food got me thinking, not food, but you have a brand. YoshimiO A clothing brand. I’ve been designing for it for about 15 years now. I have a collection coming up soon. On the 14th and 15th at OOO YYY Maison salon in Daikanyama. Anyone is free to come. Fall and winter you’ll have to order, but you can buy spring/summer items on the spot. Once that’s over we’ll do it again in Osaka. I’m super busy. But then I’ll be making curry in Osaka, too. Masaaki Hara I’m sure it will be great and everyone will line up. YoshimiO I find being a designer kind of embarrassing, so I always end up doing something else. I ended up where I am now in the course of doing all those things. Masaaki Hara But you have your music, too. YoshimiO Yeah, I do have that. Cooking really stresses me out. Because everyone’s eating it. It’s going into their bodies. Them eating it keeps me on my toes. Masaaki Hara Please check out her curry and clothing, though. We’re out of time, though, let’s wrap this up. Thank you for today, Yoshimi, and thank you all for coming. [applause]

Yury Chernavsky
When Yury Chernavsky began work as a music producer in late ’70s USSR, there was little around him to draw inspiration from and so he looked to the advances and innovations happening in the West. His career began in the late ’60s as a jazz musician, playing the violin and saxophone as a member of various orchestras, including ensembles led by Russian jazz stars Oleg Lundstrem and Leonid Utyosov as well as Muslim Magomayev’s State Jazz Orchestra of Azerbaijan. Inspired by Coltrane, Count Basie and Quincy Jones, Chernavsky worked the concert circuit for over a decade before moving into musical direction, composition and production. In the ’80s he emerged as one of Russia’s first modern-day music producers, working with rock and pop groups as well as experimenting with early synthesizer and studio technologies. In 1983 he recorded Banana Islands with Vesyolye Rebyata [Jolly Fellows], one of the first Russian rock albums to gain international attention, and three years later he founded SPM Record, Russia’s first independent music and entertainment company, and acted as musical director for the Goodwill Games.
In this public lecture as part of the Red Bull Music Festival Moscow 2018, Chernavsky sat down with local journalist Denis Boyarinov to discuss his early years on the Russian jazz circuit, discovering production and electronics and creating new music behind the Iron Curtain.
Hosted by Denis Boyarinov Here’s your microphone, maestro. Yury Alexandrovich [Chernavsky], let’s start with a short question. I consider you to be the first producer in Russia, and the only one. A producer in the best sense of the word and not in the sense many people, unfortunately too many, use in Russia, meaning someone who promotes a person doing strange things, considering him a kind of a trickster and most often a crook. I call you a producer in that good, original meaning of someone, who works with sound and talents and who, so to speak, brings out the best in a person, in a musician. That’s what I mean. What do you think of this definition? Do you like being called the first producer in Russia, do you agree with that? Yury Chernavsky In a way. The thing is that there was no notion of the producer at the time. There was no such word. It simply didn’t exist. In filmmaking, producers appeared earlier, while in music there was nothing of the kind. It wasn’t called production then, in other words. As the music industry developed, and when we started receiving all kinds of information from the West, I believe it was at the beginning of the ’80s, then people started using this word, I think. And there was that recording center we created. Denis Boyarinov But you called it a production center, didn’t you? Yury Chernavsky Yes, a production center. It was, so to speak, one of the first demonstrations of a system of development, and we tried our best to work the same way people did all around the world. Denis Boyarinov OK, let me remind the audience that we are talking about Studio of Popular Music Record, AKA SPM Record, which Yury Chernavsky founded in 1985 and which was not only the first sound production studio in the USSR that cooperated with artists, but one of the first privately held companies in the country, because private entrepreneurship was only beginning to emerge and at that time it was referred to as cooperation. As far as I know, your company was the second privately-held enterprise registered in the country. And who, do you think, was the first to register such a company? Yury Chernavsky Well, we can only guess, but the next day after Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev announced the creation of self-supporting enterprises, the instruction was given and corporate seals started being used. Yes, we were number two, it was funny. We deliberated a lot on who might be number one, and then decided that it was Mikhail Sergeyevich himself. Well, just in case. He registered something, just in case. Most certainly, in case something happens. Denis Boyarinov We’ll talk about the Record Center later, because it’s a big and interesting chapter in the history of Soviet and post-Soviet show business. Let’s start with your biography. Where did it all start from? As far as I understand, it all started with jazz. Your first profession was as a violin player, you learned to play violin, then somehow you deftly turned to the saxophone. As a matter of fact, I must say, it’s pretty much like a 360-degree turn, that’s how I would put it. Yury Chernavsky It was simply a time when I had to decide for myself what to choose. I was finishing the music academy, my studies at the conservatory were pending, and all those things. It went quite well with the violin. As I’ve already mentioned in some interviews, I got [a grade of] “very outstanding” for the state exam. It was a state exam for my specialization [in the violin], and it was something extraordinary. Everybody was so amazed, because nothing of the kind had ever happened before. As far as I know, no one else has received “very outstanding” for the state exam since then. Nevertheless, we’d been listening to saxophones and jazz. It was in 1960… what? From 1967 to ‘68, I believe. Denis Boyarinov In 1968 jazz was not like it was in the United States, right? In 1968, in the United States, jazz was a well-established traditional form of music. In our country the situation was absolutely different, because young people had only just discovered jazz music and started to play it. The first jazz festivals in the Soviet Union were held from 1965 to ‘66. That is you were, so to say... Yury Chernavsky Well, yes. Denis Boyarinov ... in the second stream, because the first one was stifled in Stalin’s time, and you were among the first in the second stream of jazz. Yury Chernavsky In any case I remember that the saxophone interested me, I liked it. I liked the instrument. It produced such an unusual sound, it all was so fashionable and attractive, this [imitates saxophone sound] and the like. Then I remember that I went to the army and stayed there among musicians of a military band for about six months. And sitting in a depot, we watched the festival which took place in Tallinn. Denis Boyarinov The famous Tallinn Jazz Festival, which officially discovered... Yury Chernavsky Sasha Pischikov, a brilliant saxophone player. We became close friends later and together played all these passages of Coltrane, because he was a perfect Coltrane player, to the very roots of his being. You wouldn’t be able to knock it out of him. Eric Dolphy didn’t mean a thing. Coltrane. And we were two Coltrane players in the whole country, we met in big bands where, for example, Boris Rensky played. Actually, it was him who made me leave the city, the city of Tambov. I left Tambov. They came there, as they said, “to dance, to listen,” to the musicians. And the next day, they introduced me to Boris Borisovich Rensky. Denis Boyarinov He is one of the jazz masters of the Soviet Union. Yury Chernavsky There were just a few such people in the country, him and [Oleg] Lundstrem, and that’s it. Well, and [Leonid] Utyosov. Denis Boyarinov You played in Utyosov’s band as well, as far as I understand, didn’t you? Yury Chernavsky Yes, in Utyosov’s band as well. Denis Boyarinov Who was better as a jazz band leader, Utyosov, Lundstrem or Rensky? Yury Chernavsky Rensky was the leader of the orchestra, it was a jazz orchestra. And Utyosov... They began as Vesyolye Rebyata [Jolly Fellows] and kept playing in the same manner, and they remained Vesyolye Rebyata. Utyosov simply invited me. I knew him, we met somewhere on tour. I knew him quite well. He said, “Yury, join us as the first saxophone.” And by that time, Lundstrem’s orchestra had already disbanded, because all its members were required to get a household registration in Moscow. You see, “No household registration?” Regardless of whether you’re a general, a developer or a musician, you’ve got to have a household registration! So all members of the orchestra left in order to obtain a household registration in Moscow. That’s when Leonid Osipovich [Utyosov] caught me. He told me, “Yury, sit down, together we will... I heard you play... All is well, there is new music. Let’s play new music.” So we started playing a kind of new music. I created some arrangements, and we’d been rehearsing... Denis Boyarinov In Coltrane’s manner? Yury Chernavsky Yes, pieces by Quincy Jones, Count Basie, these kind of classics; American classics. But, of course, we experimented and created our own compositions, some beats. Nevertheless, it all ended sadly, of course, because during rehearsals the whole orchestra was looking at me as if I were insane. I told them, “You need to play the hi-hat [imitates drum] this way, and you need to play [imitates melody], and bongos [imitates percussion],” and they were like “What? [puts hand to forehead in confusion] Vesyolye Rebyata! Tu-ru-du-du!” Of course, things were dissonant. We were all distressed. I felt harassed because we had to rehearse something, and they felt harassed because they had to sit and try to play all this. Denis Boyarinov We should also keep in mind that you were 25, 27 years old, you were a young man from Tambov. Yury Chernavsky Yes, something like this. Denis Boyarinov While Utyosov’s orchestra included experienced musicians, who were around 40 years old. Yury Chernavsky Well, yes, 40 was like an average; young men aged around 40. Denis Boyarinov It was simply an intergenerational conflict. Yury Chernavsky It was something like that. Then in Muslim’s orchestra there was a different situation, there... Denis Boyarinov I’d like to talk more about Muslim, because Muslim was none other than Muslim Magomayev, the great Azerbaijani and Soviet pop singer, who at that time was basically considered to be our Elvis Presley. Not because of the nature of his voice or, as it happened, the music he performed, although, as we know, Muslim Magomayev also used to sing twists. But rather because of the worship associated with him in the Soviet Union. Muslim Magomayev worship in the USSR, I believe, was pretty much like Elvis worship. In our country, there was obviously a kind of Magomayev-mania and you witnessed that, being a musician in his orchestra. First, tell us about Muslim Magomayev’s orchestra, so we can understand what it was like. It was a State Jazz Orchestra of Azerbaijan, as far as I understand. How many people played there approximately? Yury Chernavsky In the whole orchestra, there were about 60, 70 people. Denis Boyarinov 70 musicians? Yury Chernavsky Yes, famous female violin players, the whole thing. And our group of horns, five saxophones, five trombones, five trumpets, all as it’s supposed to be. But this big orchestra played only large concerts organized for governmental purposes, while a much smaller group went on tour. But the smaller group wasn’t so small, after all. It consisted of about 20 musicians. Not 60, but still 20. Denis Boyarinov A teeny-tiny group. Yury Chernavsky Yes, but what was important is that we all could fit into Aliev’s Yak-40 [airplane]. He generously gave it to us for touring, and it would wait for us each time after the trip. We would gather in the morning bone-weary, and the plane was waiting for us somewhere at the end of the field. It took quite some time for us to gather and board. Then an order, “Take off! Stop, don’t take off! Muslim is still asleep!” Jesus, Muslim is still asleep, which means we’ll have to wait for another four hours. Broadly speaking, we had flexible flight schedules... Denis Boyarinov So, within the Soviet Union you toured on a private jet? Yury Chernavsky Yes, I even had a chance to fly it as did all the other members of the team. Denis Boyarinov Well, that was a totally rock & roll life. Of course, Alice Cooper had his own private jet, and you, together with Muslim Magomayev, had one too. Yury Chernavsky It’s not really like we had our own private jet. He had it for himself alone, and shared it with 20 people. Denis Boyarinov But that was communism, you lived in the Soviet Union. And where did your small group of 20 people perform? Yury Chernavsky At sports arenas; the largest, of course. I don’t know about Elvis. In fact, Elvis is still an iconic figure [in America]. They celebrate the key dates of his life, a lot of fans arrive and set up camps, you know. Nothing of the kind happened with Muslim, because the system here itself didn’t allow that kind of worship. It denied such youth leaders. Denis Boyarinov At some point Muslim Magomayev had to pay for his star status. He became a victim of his own success and popularity. Yury Chernavsky I believe so, yes, he was so tired. But he had success like no one else. I worked with many different people and I liked to move from one band to another, to play in various styles, to compose and try something new. As for Muslim, his personality caused a hysteria among all women. I think among men as well. Because it was difficult to differentiate the boys and the girls there, when a Volga arrived at the staff entrance after the concert. Usually it was a black Volga, that belonged to the Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with the flashing light. And all these girls surrounded the car and literally carried it from the staff entrance to the main road. Simply carried it with their hands! That is, you could not see the car underneath. Sometimes it was like that. Not to mention some serious demonstrations in front of the hotel where our group lived. Denis Boyarinov What did you play in Muslim’s orchestra? Of course, people wanted to hear songs like “Svadba, Svadba Pela I Plyasala.” [A song called “Svadba,” or “Wedding.”] Yury Chernavsky Yes, we played “Wedding,” “Blue Eternity.” Denis Boyarinov At the same time you had a passion for all things progressive that had to do with jazz-rock? Yury Chernavsky There was such a mix of top-notch musicians, all the best people from [Anatoly] Kroll’s orchestra, from Yury Saulskiy’s and from many others. The orchestra had been assembled from the finest musicians. You see, for one concert we earned more than the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Wages were absolutely crazy, and of course, it couldn’t last long, only about three years. Then there was a financial inspection which was carried out by the OBKhSS [the Soviet financial police]. “How much?” One of us sat freezing in the Rafik [a minibus, the RAF-2203] while the man in accounting shouted for everyone to hear when we arrived to get our payment. “How much? 50 rubles for one concert?! And the same amount as bonus for going on tour?! And as much for solo?!” Denis Boyarinov We need to explain that in the Soviet Union people were paid according to standard payment rates, which were strictly regulated. These rates didn’t depend on how well you played, but rather on your rank, right? If you were an Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, for instance, then your payment rate was eight rubles for one concert, eight! And here an ordinary musician earned 50 plus 50 plus 50, this was, of course... Yury Chernavsky Well, it would be wrong to call us ordinary musicians... Denis Boyarinov Well, by ordinary, I mean having no rank. Yury Chernavsky Yes, they somehow were unable to appreciate it... They were such “experts.” As for the big band, they played perfectly and almost everything was played from sight. They were incredible professionals. Among them were Robik Andreyev, Radik Shakarov; nobody remembers them now. Also Volodya Levitin. They were people who played in the fifth octave, all those tutti sections, as if they played flute or trumpets. Denis Boyarinov Nikolay Levinovsky, for example, was one of the music directors. Yury Chernavsky Yes, there was Levinovsky there [imitates playing keys]. Denis Boyarinov Levinovsky, a great keyboard player. He was one of the few Russian jazz musicians who went abroad to the United States, had a successful career there and is still writing music. Yury Chernavsky I don’t know about his career, but he has his own orchestra there. Not a big orchestra; a medium-sized ensemble, and they perform quite successfully. Well, together with Sasha Pischikov we are an example of exactly such an alliance. We immersed ourselves in all these philosophical matters, related to Buddhism, Europeanism, Confucianism and other philosophical schools, it was in general something... It was only later, as I understand it, that rock & roll adopted such philosophies. These were the basic concepts, so to say, to which we added something and put those ideas into people’s heads. As a reward for our work, we were allowed to play a couple of songs with the orchestra. When Muslim left to get some rest, naturally there was a complete mess in terms of music, so much new and unusual stuff was played every day. One day, Kolya would write something, the next day it would be Sasha Pischikov, me or someone else. And we played all this, and it was wonderful. These were the sips of freedom. Can you imagine Muslim singing, “Akh, eta svadba, svadba, svadba,” [lyrics from the “Wedding” song] and people scream, try to reach him with their hands, someone faints, paramedics run with stretchers, someone’s being carried out. And then we appear. And the audience falls into lethargy. They sit and talk to each other. However, we also found tricks to wake them up. We learned to play to the crowd, but still there was such a huge contrast between “Wedding” and our compositions, you see? It was impossible for us to compete with Muslim. Nevertheless, later jazz-rock became something big. It began with bands like Earth, Wind & Fire, names like Bill Chase, perhaps you remember them. Denis Boyarinov Blood, Sweat & Tears. Yury Chernavsky Blood, Sweat & Tears, and it was very exciting, rhythmic and simply great. Denis Boyarinov Was Muslim Magomayev attracted by fashion trends? Did he want to try jazz-rock? Yury Chernavsky He was, and I even created a version of “Svadba” in the manner of Bill Chase. Denis Boyarinov That’s interesting, “Svadba” as jazz-rock. Tell me more about it. Yury Chernavsky It was not easy. Our orchestrator approaches me and tells me, “Listen, our chief orchestrator is ill,” and he was often ill, approximately once a week, after the weekend. Concerts exhausted him. In general, the tiredness had its effect. So he says, “Yury, we have a concert, we need something new, Muslim wants something fresh, can you help?” Well, we come in, and Muslim says he is a progressive person, that he likes music. Very well. So we settled upon Bill Chase. We have good trumpeters, they are all tall. We started, and there is a complicated pattern. At the beginning the trumpets play at the top of the range where there is a complex pattern, then there is a pause, and then it goes into a rhythmic pattern. A bit fractional, a little bit Latin-American, a little bit like that. And he sings about his “Svadba.” And in the end, at the rehearsal – the whole orchestra is there – everyone looks sour afterwards, you know... Denis Boyarinov The weekend. Yury Chernavsky After dates with beloved girls on Sundays. In every city someone had a beloved girl, because we’d been to these cities many times. So we start to rehearse, played everything well; the rhythmic textures, off-beats, everything. Muslim is silent! Muslim, “Just a second, now I will...” So, we rehearsed the rhythm. All goes well. Once more, again off-beats, quick intro, trumpeters play at the highest range, already red-faced like tomatoes, it’s difficult to play like this. Off-beats; Muslim! No answer. “OK, got it.” We start again, trumpets played their part perfectly at the top of the range… off-beats; Muslim? “Go-o-ot it,” says Muslim, “Now we’ll do it!” And six, seven times like that. Jazz-rock was difficult for him. Then our trumpeters, who could hardly walk off stage they were so tired, called me to their table after the rehearsal to have a cup of coffee. Robik Andreyev, a very good trumpeter and a competent musician, says, “Yury-jan, if you write jazz-rock for Muslim ever again, I swear on my mother, I’ll quit, I want to die in my native land.” This had a fantastic effect. And then comes Muslim who says, “That was real jazz-rock, let me just get used to it a little.” So we never even talked about jazz-rock after that. But all the rest, the team, was great. I’d never seen so many flowers. First of all, I wondered where they got them from, there must have been special trains... They must have used their own Azerbaijani channels. The stage, which was much larger than this room, in the sports arena, was all covered knee-high in roses. Denis Boyarinov I know you’ve got more stories about the fun you had as a rock & roll and jazz star, when you played with Muslim Magomayev’s orchestra, but let’s go back to the music. Later, as far as I understand, when OBKhSS discovered your real earnings… Yury Chernavsky It was all over. Denis Boyarinov The musicians’ salaries were set back to standard Soviet rates, and the orchestra consisting of star jazzmen disbanded, right? And you, curiously enough, as far as I know started working in Metropol restaurant. You... What did you do there? Yury Chernavsky At that time we’d already been very much into new [musical] developments. Peter Gabriel emerged, his band Genesis was already well known, Phil Collins emerged, and all this London crowd, as they call it, which also included Brian Eno, Bryan Ferry, then Sting, Gabriel, Elton John and all the rest, like George Michael. There were many of them. By the way, now a very serious system is being developed there under Ed Sheeran. A lot of talented young people aged 19, 20 work under him. They have amazing voices and work hard, and the audience reciprocates, which is interesting. The music is not so simple, and they get 70-100 million views in a week. In a nutshell, London has always been a kind of breeding ground. People make their first steps in London, then they go to New York, progress there, then to Los Angeles, where they record their albums, then in Los Angeles they receive financing from New York, their music is distributed and producers create all kinds of campaigns to make stars of these nearly accomplished musicians. Of course, nothing can compare to Hollywood. The main value of producers there is that they never work with beginners, or those who achieved early success. You need to go through all the rounds by yourself and when you’re almost ready, when you’ve already achieved something, when the girls follow you on Sunset Boulevard, that’s when they come in and take you to an international level and spare no expense or anything else for this purpose. Denis Boyarinov But let’s go back to Moscow of the late ’70s, to Metropol restaurant. Why would an accomplished musician work in Metropol restaurant? Yury Chernavsky We didn’t tour much, musicians were not in demand at all. Well, who needed us when Vesyolye Rebyata was considered to be the best band in the universe. Denis Boyarinov At that time in the Soviet Union. Yury Chernavsky Yes, so you can imagine that everybody who could play and sing, if you couldn’t sing a word in English of course, your career would be over. Denis Boyarinov Well, you couldn’t do it on stage, but you could in a restaurant. Yury Chernavsky You can play anything in a restaurant. The cooks were also very grateful and they would treat us with delicious things. As soon as we arrived they called us, “Guys!” we were like, “Yes?” I don’t remember what songs they liked, Elton John or whatever, so they asked us to play something of that kind, and we did. Denis Boyarinov You played Elton John for cooks, and they treated you for that. Yury Chernavsky Yes, they set up a very beautiful table, a big table, which was right near the stage, and we looked at it, because it would be improper to eat during our work hours, so this table was always reserved for us. After each new song we played they brought a new dish to the table. Not to mention different Caucasian songs, that we also performed with pleasure, especially given that we were treated with such delicious shashlik [grilled meats] for that, that was… Denis Boyarinov In a jazz-rock manner! Yury Chernavsky I think each of us could sing something with pleasure. Denis Boyarinov So Moscow nightclubs in 1979 meant things like Metropol and some other restaurants, right? Yury Chernavsky Metropol, Budapest. A very good band played at Budapest... Denis Boyarinov Where excellent musicians would play whatever you wish for 25 rubles per song. Yury Chernavsky These guys could sing perfectly, they were wonderful vocalists. But then all of this, again, you know, no matter how hard they tried there they wouldn’t be able to go to another country, where nobody understood Russian. It was like in the 19th century with Russian classical music, I think. Until the age of 18 I played a lot of classical music and, from my point of view, our classics were no worse than music composed by Verdi and the others. Denis Boyarinov You mean the Mighty Handful, the Russian composers? Yury Chernavsky Well, not only the Mighty Handful. As we discussed, [Alexander] Borodin, who else... Denis Boyarinov Yes. Borodin, [Nikolay] Rimsky-Korsakov, [César Antonovich] Cui. Yury Chernavsky Right, Borodin was the leader of their group. And not only them. Take more recent ones, such as [Sergei] Rachmaninov or [Pyotr Ilyich] Tchaikovsky, they created interesting music. 60% of all classics performed nowadays, even in the United States, that are rotated on classical music radio stations, are from Russia. Classical music from Russia. But as far as singing, it’ll be in Italian. That’s how it is. The Italian language was considered the right language for singing, and it remains so. As for modern culture, it’s absolutely different. You won’t be able to do anything without the English language. First of all, because everybody got used to it, and then people now are more or less familiar with English. Even in Russia, I believe every fifth person can speak or at least understand English. That’s why it’s easy to understand the lyrics, the English language sounds. It’s impossible to obtain such specific sounds singing in Russian. English words sound softer and you can sing them off-beat; that is this manner of singing in colloquial English, with the English syllables developed earlier. So when you hear the same music in another language, it sounds a bit strange. But now the Chinese do something in this area, Asian people… Denis Boyarinov People in many countries do. Yury Chernavsky Yes, but they do other experiments, work with disco stuff, that’s what it comes from. But all classic rock music is in English. Denis Boyarinov So, in your point of view, the problem with Russian music is that Russian singers are of no demand abroad, due to the language barrier, right? Yury Chernavsky Yes, it’s the principal thing. Denis Boyarinov Vocalists in our country don’t and can’t sing in English. Yury Chernavsky I don’t think you’re right. We have plenty of those, who do and can, but nobody supports them. Everywhere they turn to they face hurdles. And we together, remember, created a website similar to that of my first record label, but that was the second version. We created a site, where was it? Open Space. Denis Boyarinov On Open Space. Yury Chernavsky We created this on Open Space and announced that, “Those who sing in English, who want to work all around the world and not only in their native country, who want to go beyond the borders, to see what there is, how people live there, how they play and sing…” Because when you’re introduced into a new system, into a company of interesting well-prepared musicians somewhere in the West, you should also get a little prepared, right? Otherwise they won’t accept you, they’ll close the door and that’s it. You should prepare a little, a tiny little bit, because if you can’t do even that or can’t even ask, “May I come in?” Or have to deliberate a lot in order to say something like, “Hi, buddy!” That’s why in this case language plays a vital role, so that we could say, “Here are our guys, from Russia...” And how many musicians, do you think, who could write and compose their own music, visited us? Artemy Troitsky, we invited him, he also visited us. Artemy Troitsky said, “Yury, what are you talking about, we won’t find anything there, there are five people, five friends, who sit somewhere in their cellar strumming something...” So having no big expectations, we still opened it together with Denis. On the first day 200 bands arrived, didn’t they? Denis Boyarinov Well, there were very many applications. Yury Chernavsky Actually, their English was very good. Well, they had a little bit of an accent, but that was no big deal. At least, they had the music, the lyrics, all this. People were actually ready to learn to do it professionally and to work. If you work with such a person, then in two years, he’ll be in the music industry. This someone will become a superstar or will be a musician working in the studio or will be giving small concerts somewhere. It doesn’t matter, he’ll be among all these people. You see, all these famous people didn’t just become famous in one day, they earned their status. Take George Michael, for instance, who died several years ago. Today as we were coming here by taxi, the taxi driver turned the radio on, and there George Michael was singing, and the driver looked sad... Denis Boyarinov A taxi driver? Yury Chernavsky Yes. He said, “I have all his albums at home, and this is my favorite song.” That is… Success doesn’t come cheap. Denis Boyarinov No, it doesn’t. OK, so we have talented people in Russia, but they lack support, right? We don’t get it from the state, we don’t see it. Yury Chernavsky It’s not about support, it’s just that... Denis Boyarinov ... in the Soviet Union there was no such thing at all. Yury Chernavsky We simply faced a lot of hurdles everywhere. It’s not only that they didn’t offer any support. They even threw obstacles in the way. This is prohibited, and that. Denis Boyarinov OK, let’s go back to your own story: How you, despite the fact that you lived in this rigid Soviet system with all its obstacles, managed somehow to stick to your own principles and do it your way. And I’d like first to give a few music examples so that people not familiar with the songs of Yury Chernavsky can better understand. So, right after you left the job at the restaurant, you joined Krasnye Maki [Red Poppies, a vocal and instrumental ensemble]. Let’s just listen to what Krasnye Maki played when Yury Chernavsky joined them. (music: Krasnye Maki – “Spinning Disks”) I’d like to emphasize that it was the first time the words “disco club” and “disc jockey,” used in this song, were heard in the Soviet Union. That alone is an invaluable contribution made by Yury Alexandrovich. Yury Chernavsky People didn’t know that such words existed. Denis Boyarinov Yes indeed, many people heard these words for the first time and the album itself, which was called Kruzhatsya Diski [Spinning Disks] was a conceptual album representing the disco DJ approach. It was mixed; that is, tracks were mixed into each other. Yury Chernavsky Yes. Denis Boyarinov No one had done anything of the kind before in the Soviet Union and hardly anyone came close later. But technically you had to write and produce disco music in absolutely different conditions compared to Americans. That’s what I particularly like; you had these crazy electronic sounds, which later became a trademark of yours. How did you do it technically? What kind of synthesizer did you use then? Yury Chernavsky At that time the first synthesizers were appearing on the market and by a twist of fate I had a chance to play on them, thanks to being a part of Krasnye Maki. Although the band was not fantastic, it was created by the Tula Regional Committee of Komsomol. The young man who was the leader of the band was a tough nut. He always wanted his band to have the best. Including all the first synthesizers, such as the Moog, when it had just appeared. Everybody already knew about it. Moog, Moog. I also had a Moog, then ARP, then some others. That is, we had several good synthesizers; not bad, you could do something on them. I worked as a keyboard player. Of course, I can also play piano, but synthesizers always interested me, I liked to work with timbres, with banks of timbres, with some very interesting sounds. Denis Boyarinov And that’s how you got to the forefront of electronic dance music in the Soviet Union. Yury Chernavsky Yes, what I created in the studio was almost impossible to recreate. You see, on the synthesizer you simply turn some knobs. You adjust the frequency, for instance, and get absolutely different sounds. And that was before people started making sound banks… Denis Boyarinov All these presets... Yury Chernavsky To download MIDI you needed to know all those settings, you literally had to be a professor. That’s why I did something for myself every day. That’s how the first years were, and they quickly passed by. We recorded “Banany” [“Bananas”] in 1983, and then everything was, so to say... Denis Boyarinov The quality became better. Yury Chernavsky The equipment became more advanced. It’s still valued, by the way. Now these synthesizers are called vintage synthesizers. Denis Boyarinov Classic models, yes, from a golden era. Yury Chernavsky The Jupiter 8, for example, cost $500 at that time. Now its price... I checked an online store and they had a used Jupiter 8 for almost $10,000. Analog synthesizers are coming back now and growing in value. People have played with the digital stuff, which is now only used for recording, and only with advanced applications, allowing you to export MIDI files which are then replayed using analog sounds and recorded on tape. That is, on a digital synthesizer you record melodies for different instruments; the digital stuff is easier to edit, you see. And the sound itself is absolutely different from the one you have on tape, because here it’s much softer, richer and more dimensional. That’s how it is; what’s old is new again. Denis Boyarinov Since we started talking about Bananovye Ostrova [Banana Islands], I need to say that this album was a milestone in the history of Russian pop music, which, in my opinion, did not receive due recognition. Because despite the popularity of the album, it was not officially released until 30 years later. It had been lying on a shelf, and the whole story that was invented by you, together with Vladimir Matetsky, unfortunately, was not released in due time. Bananovye Ostrova was a revolutionary album; you can read about it on the internet. The good thing is that you created it using the capabilities of the Vesyolye Rebyata band, which was the most popular ensemble in the Soviet Union at that time. I’d like to give you some examples of what Vesyolye Rebyata were playing before Yury Chernavsky joined them. (music: Yury Chernavsky – “Malchik Bananan”/ applause) Yury Chernavsky They used this song in the movie Assa. People are familiar with this composition only because they watched the movie. Denis Boyarinov Most people know this song as the soundtrack to Assa. But the song was written much earlier, and it inspired the screenwriter of the film to create the plot. That’s why the main hero of the movie is called Malchik Bananan [the boy Bananan]. But that’s not what I wanted to ask you. So you created this album using Vesyolye Rebyata; Pavel Slobodkin got scared and didn’t want to release it, and that’s why the album wasn’t released. It was released unofficially, and quickly sold out. People would dub tapes of it from each other, and within two years the song “Malchik Bananan” was the main hit at Soviet disco parties, according to organizers in Moscow and Leningrad. So I have a question: You had all these technical capabilities at your disposal, all these musicians from Vesyolye Rebyata who loved to play with you – you can feel it when you listen to the record. So why did you decide to sing yourself in Bananovye Ostrova when you had professional vocalists at your disposal? Yury Chernavsky Yes, Buynov could sing quite well, Lyosha Glyzin also, but he was our lyricist. Who else... And there were other solo vocalists, but they were about the country which… And it all turned out kind of strange, funny, and I hated it. You mean the way Pashkin staged all this, right? Slobodkin, [imitates music intro then sings] “I Vesyolaya Strana” [“And Joyful Country”]. That is no fun at all. No relationship to the original ideas, like, “It seemed to you that we had also prepared, yes, for you.” And then he became a member of the Union of Composers. Denis Boyarinov Unfortunately, there’s very little time left. We only have five minutes, so if anybody from the audience has questions for Yury Chernavsky, you have a chance to ask them now. Audience Member For 30 years, since Assa was released and the song became popular, I’ve been wondering… Someone claimed – I don’t remember now who it was – that [the character] Bananan was created as a hint that the KGB monitored all telephone conversations, that in each phone handset there sat such a Bananan. Was Bananan really intended this way or was it just tomfoolery, when these words were written? Yury Chernavsky Well, I believe every fool has his own agenda, right? People don’t fool around for no reason, everyone has a message that he wants to deliver. Naturally, the sound I made in that song at that time was very popular. But people on the board of artistic experts didn’t see any meaning in it. I wrote all the lyrics relying on the guys I communicated with. We kept very cheerful company in Moscow, consisting of the local elite, which included various gamblers, doctors, philosophers, artists, sons of members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR, alcoholics and many others. In general, it was such a diverse team as they say now. It was a cool community, we never had a dull moment. And this was written for people who could read between the lines... Who could extract some meaning even if it seemed senseless at first sight. But these were actually nothing but ordinary short fictitious stories. Naturally, there were some stories with numerous layers of meanings, like with this robot, “I’ve gone crazy,” I wrote the lyrics for it, this refrain was written when I was watching TV. I lay down on a couch – we’d already finished this album, and we needed a couple more songs. And I lay down and watched TV with half-closed eyes, and there appeared a man with a tie and medals, he was a hero of labor – a mine worker-operator, this kind of multi-hyphenate – and he started talking. And the more he talked, the more it became clear that he was a total moron with regalia. And I sat and listened, unable to extract any meaning from his words. He said, “We reached, we have a party.” And I had an idea that he was not a human, but a robot. Simply, “I’m a robot, I’ve gone crazy, ” and that’s it. [claps jokingly] Whoever was alive at that time must remember those funny TV shows with... Nowadays television also reminds us of those times. Denis Boyarinov That’s why today the Bananovye Ostrova album remains relevant, I would say. Other questions? OK, one question, please. Do we have time for one question? Audience Member I have a question regarding the Goodwill Games of 1986. How did you get involved, how did you receive that proposal to write the music? Was it the initiative of our party leaders or did the Americans themselves find you? And one more, excuse me, accompanying question. Is it possible that your music, as well as music written for the Goodwill Games and for our cartoons, will be released in the future? Yury Chernavsky Guys, I don’t know, the thing is that I didn’t keep original records, you see. When all is well, you don’t spend time collecting your own pictures, right? And then comes the time when people ask you, “You were so pretty when you were a boy, and where can we find your picture?” And there’s no pretty boy, because nobody took a picture of you. That’s why we didn’t keep the originals, thinking that the Soviet power was strong and soon we’d have communism all around the world, and all original records would be kept safe for ages. And now, given that everything was plundered and stolen, I have no idea where to look for them. Although, maybe with help... If Denis asks for help, “Guys, could you please help us to find something.” By the way, that’s what we did. You helped us, as far as I remember. Denis Boyarinov Yes, there is the vinyl anthology published in a very limited edition... Yury Chernavsky Yes, you helped us to find those. Denis Boyarinov ... in fact, that was all we could find and collect from the available records. The thing you are talking about, of course, we would also like it very much, to hear the music for the Goodwill Games and the music for cartoons, but they are really now only available on YouTube, there are no originals. Yury Chernavsky And there was an interesting story related to the Goodwill Games. We’d already recorded something, well, not something I took to like a duck to water. And I’d already started making music. You know, there were interesting people. Alla Pugacheva, we were friends and we still keep in touch. We were good friends and communicated a lot for about ten years until I went to Europe. Also Misha Boyarsky, who is not an ordinary person, anything but a simple guy. I poked fun at him, and he produced such masterpieces. That’s all Vova Presnyakov, and it was actually me who pulled him out from where he lived, somewhere on the outskirts of Moscow. They had an apartment there, and I was just making a film with [Georgi Yungvald] Khilkevich, called Vyshe Radugi [Above the Rainbow], and there the boy had to sing, well, in a boy’s voice, and everybody suggested to try girls, because it was impossible to find 13-year-old boys. And I couldn’t stand those boys, who considered “The Marmot Boy’s Song,” written by Ludwig van Beethoven after a night out and with the most terrible hangover, to be a great work of art. Well, it was a song for music schools, that’s all that was generally available. And then I visited Volodya Presnyakov Sr., we were old friends. And he said, “I don’t know, here’s my kid, I don’t know where to settle him. Yesterday they drank beer with some guys.” We talked and he said that nobody wanted to hire him; he could sing, he had taught him to sing Al Jarreau. He said we must have met. He also sang in falsetto, finely, various fioritura. He said, “I taught him to sing, but this falsetto, what is it. Nobody...” And I had this 13-year-old boy with “Marmot” in my mind, with a high-pitched voice, whom I listened to recently. And I asked him to show me what he was like. So a boy comes running, a merry, curly-haired boy, and asks, “What, papa?” “Well, play something, improvise.” He sat, and expertly played all those tricky parts at the very top, including leaps, skips, intervals, improvising quite well. And I had an idea, “I think I know what to do.” That’s how the star called Vladimir Presnyakov was born. Denis Boyarinov Thank you very much, Yury Alexandrovich. Unfortunately, we have to end now. Thank you very much, thank you for... Yury Chernavsky. [applause]

ToteKing
Manuel González Rodríguez, AKA ToteKing, arrived at the top of Spain’s rap scene from an unlikely place. Born in Seville, Rodríguez grew up as a rock and heavy metal fan before discovering hip-hop and rap via a friend he played basketball with. This discovery eventually led him into the then-burgeoning local scene. His career began as part of the group La Alta Escuela, whose lead MC Juaninacka Rodríguez credits as his primary inspiration. Following the dissolution of La Alta Escuela in 2000, Rodríguez began a solo career as ToteKing that brought him to the top of the game and currently includes seven solo albums, as well as two in collaboration with his younger brother, Shotta. With an intricate style rooted in the deep lyricism he witnessed in his early years, ToteKing has secured his place in the annals of Spanish rap by staying rooted, while not being afraid to navigate the ever-changing creative landscape of hip-hop.
In this lecture at the Red Bull Music Academy presents Laboratorio La Havana 2019, ToteKing retraced his steps from the basketball courts of Seville, explaining the importance of both lyricism and heavy metal to his creative process as well as speaking frankly on the lessons of success, and how he manages growing old in a young person’s artform.
Hosted by Serko Fu Let’s welcome my brother ToteKing [applause]. It’s a pleasure to have you here. I know many know you through your music, your work with your group, your many records, I think you’re one of the most prolific writers in Spain. But for those who don’t know you, tell them a little. Toteking OK, brother. Hello, everyone! If I can go backwards in time, the first thing that comes to mind is La Alta Escuela. But as we’re talking about beginnings and how everything started, I’ll reveal some things about who introduced me to rap, because it wasn’t La Alta Escuela. I was a metal head from Seville, a guy who listened to rock, with my long hair. And perhaps in 1993 or ’94 Rage Against the Machine released their album, their first LP. And so I saw that those two worlds, metal and rap, could be combined and co-exist. And in a good way. Up until that album, I’d never heard rap. The only connection I had to rap was what I heard from a guy, called Paco Carreño, who’s my buddy since forever, and was a neighbor of mine. I saw that guy wearing Jordans, with shaved legs. I remember those details, a kid with shaved legs, you know? It wasn’t a common sight. I had long hair and played basketball. It turns out I was better at it than Paco, he was just starting. He arrived with his Jordan shorts, his shaved legs, his sneakers, his faded, shaved hairstyle. I got there with my mane in a ponytail. I’d listened to the Rage Against the Machine album, around ’93 or ’94, as I was saying. I’m not sure what year it was, but around that. And one day playing in the school… We jumped the fence to play in the neighborhood school. We jumped a fence, threw the ball over it and played basketball there. My friend Paco asked me to teach him to do a left-handed layup, because it was his weak hand. And I spent all afternoon teaching him how to do it. I played a little better by then. And in return he invited me to his house, as he wanted to show me his rap collection. So the first thing he played for me, and it blew my mind, was a demo tape very few people know. I don’t know if Baghira knows it. It’s from a Sevillan group called K.B. Posse. K.B. Posse was Sevillan old school by definition, along with Draches. Those groups existed before SFDK, for example. It blew my mind, because I got to his house and he had like a TDK tape collection, all recorded. And he had things like Das EFX, he had Public Enemy, EPMD. Every tape had its label, with lyrics. And I, with my long hair. So, from that day on Paco and I started to share. I taught him rock and metal stuff, and he taught me rap stuff. And joking around one day he brought a radio with an auxiliary port, and he connected a tiny mic with a really short cable that he’d bought in the neighborhood store. And he connected it to the auxiliary port. He’d gotten a KRS-One tape, and he’d used the last free beat in the tape from the “MCs Act Like They Don’t Know” song. So he looped that ending by hand, from one tape to the other and he got a minute-worth of instrumental. There were times when it didn’t fall right and it didn’t keep time, because he hadn’t cut and pasted it right. We started to fool around with the tiny mic. Without knowing what we were doing, we’d take the mic and see a Snoop Dogg video, or an MTV video, and then we’d try to rap, saying anything into the mic. A little of everything. Of course he was better at it than me, he got it better, I didn’t know what I was doing. Well, ’93 or ’94. By ’95 I’d cut my hair. By ’96 I’d bought rapper clothes and shaved my legs. Paco came to play for my team. He played for a local team and I took him to a more serious team, in which I played. From that day on we were inseparable. Now he lives in New York. I don’t see him anymore because he’s abroad, but we’re always in touch. He was the first person I rapped with or tried to rap with, at least. Picture that, the first time I tried to write something with him, joking around, was perhaps in ’95 or ’94. In ’96 I think I met Juaninacka in college. And in ’96 or ’97 Juaninacka and his friends from Coria told me they had a group called La Alta Escuela, and that I should join. And I did, fooling around, it was all a joke, we didn’t really know what we were doing, you know? It was intuition. Juaninacka was the only one I remember as a person who knew how to rap well. Serko Fu Do you remember the first song, or the first verse you thought you knew what you were doing, and would say, “OK, this is it?” Toteking I marked those memories down. What pushed me… Because with Paco I knew the history, I started to get a little into rap. Fooling around, playing, right? But then I saw Juani rap a song, that one never came out, it’s all in our La Alta Escuela demo, that’s called “El Rey De La Línea” and talked about buses. Because our life back then was buses all day, because the people in La Alta Escuela lived in Coria. To go to Coria I had to take two buses, a city transit bus... Baghira knows what I’m talking about because he lives in Lora del Río. And I had to travel for... I lost about an hour going to rehearsals with them. I remember Juani talking about that bus on that line in that rap he had, the “El Rey De La Línea” one. When I heard that rap, I said, “OK, now this is getting serious.” So, from then on, my whole life revolved around writing lyrics that came close to Juani’s worst. And so I learned to rap, because I was next to a guy who was, and is, a Spanish rap legend. Serko Fu You say you discovered Das EFX, KRS-One, etc. with your friend, right? I remember one of your first songs, well, one of the first I knew, at least, that got here, that referenced some characters like indie, indie rap from the West Coast, and things like that. And I sensed that some of the tracks you chose, I don’t know if you got involved in making them, kind of had that vibe, didn’t they? Was that music influential to you? What did you listen to back then? What references did you have? What kind of music were you more into? Toteking In the time of La Alta Escuela, besides learning to rap with them, the thing is, the three of them, Juanma, Juani and Randy, one of the amazing things I learned in Seville was that they had more music living in a small town, and knew more rap than the people I knew in Seville. And that got out when La Alta Escuela joined with SFDK, and we would hang in a park, rapping with Zatu and the people from La Gota Que Colma. Juani and Randy were more knowledgeable about music than anyone else. So I remember that time when everything was in New York, everything was on the East Coast. And Juani brought an album he’d bought, a Southern Record, as we used to buy from a store called Southern Records. It’s in Madrid, and we had to buy the records through a catalog, that is, through the mail. And many times you didn’t know what you were buying. You know? Kind of randomly. To check out its sound, because you knew that this person had collaborated with that other person. So, you had Loud Records, because you knew that label worked with talented people, right? Juani brought the first Xzibit album. And it was like, “Man, that’s not New York, that’s much fresher, more musical, but at the same time it’s so rapper!” So, as a result of that Xzibit album, I think it was called “Paparazzi,” or not, that was the song. I don’t remember what the album with the song “Paparazzi” was called. We started after that LP, I fell in love with that sound. I like New York, because nowadays I like everything, because everything is more open and there’s a thousand things. But at that time I discovered Lootpack, Wildchild, Madlib. I discovered people
who did freestyle, who called themselves Freestyle Fellowship. Yes, Styles of Beyond, who were the kids from Reseda. El Ríu, right. I loved those people because they gave me ideas and ways of rapping. I took many of those styles for myself. From those days, from those kids, because New York was very loud and I didn’t do well [with that]. Because my voice is sh-t. I yelled twice and my voice was gone. And I saw people modulating their voice, Evidence. I saw them more relaxed and thought, “That’s what I should do.” Because I feel more comfortable there. You can notice a change in my albums. Louder albums, and much more relaxed albums. I learned to use my voice closer to the mic. I sang better and it sounded prettier. Juani knew how to do that. Juani’s voice was loud in La Alta Escuela, but if you pay attention, later he relaxed and that was when his rapping was enjoyable. And yeah, the West Coast hip-hop scene blew everybody’s minds. Serko Fu Circling back to Seville. You mentioned some groups, SFDK, La Gota Que Colma, when you got together back then. Do you think that established a sound particular to Seville and eventually to Spanish rap? A sound you could identify today? Toteking Every chance I get and to the day I die, I will say that Seville’s sound was created by Juaninacka. I’m sorry if it’s hard to hear. All my respect for SFDK, they did the most important job in Seville, but the greatest talent was always Juaninacka. And that’s obvious, I think it’s like that. Juani could write at writer level. I think Juani is a person who wasn’t encouraged enough to write literature, because he should’ve been the one to write literature, not others. For example, when Juani joined the scene the little kids who were beginning to come hang out with us had the chance to see the Pino Montano scene, which was super authentic. What Zatu set up on the street with his friends was unique. I hadn’t seen that in any other neighborhood. They got a radio with batteries, people would pool their cash to buy booze and batteries. And we spent the whole night rapping there. And that was something that no one could take away from the Pino Montano neighborhood that created that scene, because that was brutal, in fact we all went there. Anyone who rapped in Seville knew that if they wanted to know if they were good they had to go rap with the SFDK crowd in Pino Montano. It was a mandatory hang-out spot. And I remember one night there when people started coming and they were really young kids. Jesuly hung out there, Buda, my 16-year-old brother. My brother would come to those cyphers with us and he’d join in, all stammering and young. I remember Límite, Límite’s people were kids, man. All those people had the chance to live a very authentic thing. There was a very beautiful park in Pino Montano, and people didn’t go there, because the rap crowd had taken over it. It was so crowded that people would take a big detour to avoid it. And that was our park. We were always rapping. That’s where most of the Sevillan scene learned to rap. Serko Fu Interesting, interesting. So you did a sort of recounting of the La Alta Escuela days. You released your solo album, or your solo single, and you also had a project with your brother, right? So you can say you’ve been in a group, you’ve been in a duo and you’ve gone solo. Where do you feel more comfortable? Toteking Well, as you mentioned the project with my brother, I’ll tell you briefly what happened there. After the La Alta Escuela record, which I deeply regret, because basically everything I rapped on there sucks, and I didn’t know, I didn’t, I told you. I’d just started rapping with my buddy Paco. I had had long hair for three years. I was doing my thing back then. After the La Alta Escuela record, the LP didn’t work out, there wasn’t a concert scene, either, and there were four groups. I remember at that time you saw Mucho Muchacho, you saw Violadores del Verso, SFDK, CPW and that was it. There wasn’t a scene, so we gave like... La Alta Escuela did like six concerts. The group broke up and I did a demo. I recorded that demo with Jefe De La M, whom I’d met, he was Zatu’s friend. And he proposed doing a demo to me and we did. I made like 15 copies of that CD, at my uncle’s place with his CD recorder, and I gave them out to my buddies. One of them gave it to Darío, who was Sergio Aguilar’s brother, a guy who had a record label in Seville… Serko Fu The guy from Superego, damn! Toteking Well, exactly, so this guy called me and offered a record deal for two or three albums. What was happening with my brother? I had a room at my parents’ house, I shared a room, we slept in twin beds with my brother, in a tiny room. I spent all day with my brother. And like I told you, my brother came to the cyphers and rapped with us, so it caught me off guard. We did freestyle at home and we rapped, it was impossible to have privacy. My brother would get up and he was the first to claim the computer. Go on Napster, download music, write fast, then if one of us was writing the other one would hear him. Or leave the room. So one day I was listening and I was like, “My brother’s a better rapper than me, man!” I swear I felt it, “This guy is at my level already. This son of a b-tch is great!” So I had the record deal, and I thought, “Why release a solo album, if I just started. I have my brother right here, who’s rapping with me every day.” And I say, “OK! Let’s record an album.” So I called the label and said, instead of ToteKing we’ll be ToteKing and Shotta. And we made Tu Madre Es Una Foca,
just like that, an album. The lyrics came super easily because we wrote them together in our room. And then, to answer your question, because I’m rambling, after that LP, as my brother is a mess and it’s very hard to work with him on tour, because little brothers are a hassle, and on the road, well, we got mad really quickly. He wouldn’t arrive in time to rehearsals, or he’d be stoned. One day he wouldn’t show up. He pulled three or four like that and I’m a strict guy, I like order. If I arrange a time I want it to be respected, I’m obsessive like that. So he screwed me over twice and I said, “OK, that’s it, I’m out.” I did Musica Para Enfermos and I started to do it alone. Afterwards we did the Héroe album. He comes with me on tour, we’re always together, we rap together all the time. But I wouldn’t know which feels more comfortable. I can say that doing an album alone is a real pain. To make 15 songs by yourself, the choruses, decide the collabs, every damn lyric,
first bit, second bit. It’s a hassle. People are smarter nowadays. They do a song here, a song there, and they have a good time. Serko Fu Exactly. And about that, you say it’s very hard. Not harder, but trickier, right? More work. Doing it alone, in general. But what’s up with the creative process? Somehow you have more control. You do whatever you want in your solo album, right? Could you share with us Tote’s creative process? How does he write a song? Toteking Well, I’d thought about doing something, showing you an interesting thing. As I always held rock in my heart and I never left metal, in the La Alta Escuela times... Well I’ll tell this story because it’s one of the things Juani did, and that we did together and it was really fun. At that time there weren’t beats like there are today. What was a beat? I get online or I can ask a producer. But nowadays if you don’t want to ask a producer you go online, look for this or that beat, and there are thousands. To have a beat back then on a CD, was a really unusual thing. So, for example, I remember many La Alta Escuela lyrics were written by rapping over rap songs. So we’d take a Smoothe Da Hustler song, as I loved that album of his, like “Murdafest.” And over that song… We knew our buddy Moro had done a beat for us that was around 90 BPM. Intuitively we looked for an American song that we’d love, and we’d rap over the guy. At home. And it was a pain because you had to write trying to ignore the other dude rapping. Juani, me, and Juanma, wrote many of those lyrics over American rap songs with the guy singing. Afterwards the beat would come and you went again to the beat they’d given you. And sometimes it wasn’t so close and it was a pain. Sometimes it would fit and sometimes another thing happened that I love in music, and that is randomness. And I discovered that in those times, and to this day I still work like that. I love the first feeling a beat gives you. But a half hour later I hate it already. I need to hold onto the first two hours of being in contact with a beat. An instrumental I love arrives and I can’t be working on it for three months, because I start to hate it. Even if I wrote something good for it. So I always try to write with another beat, and then I go to the beat I’m actually using. So, for example, I’d take, I’d grab from my record collection, the ones I had, rock albums mostly, that had leftover loops. And for example this group called Kyuss, that I’ve liked all my life, this record is from ’95, I wrote “Matemáticas” with this. And afterwards I went to the beat Hozone gave me. But I wrote it to that other beat. There were people who told me, “This is too heavy.” But it was a different style to what I’d find in the instrumental later. And it would open my mind. So many of the songs, when I thought, “Why would I rap with an American bothering me?” I would go and pick out Rage Against the Machine loops and ask some producer to duplicate them for me. I would take loops from Kyuss, I would take loops from other songs, written with different music, so I wouldn’t get tired of the instrumental I’d use later. And I also like the feeling of writing with something else, and changing the rap later to a new beat. Many of my songs didn’t get written with those beats. “Bartleby & Co.” from my last album, Lebron, that I think is one of the best songs I’ve ever written, it’s written with an instrumental no one would imagine. I mean, it sucks, it’s lousy. Serko Fu Which is it? Toteking One Rune gave me, he didn’t even like it, he told me, “That one?” And I said, “It makes me feel like writing.” So the first thing that inspires me to write, I grab on it fast. Even if it’s a damn piano someone played. I grab onto that and then I record the acapella with another beat. And I like randomness, the feeling of putting the acapella over another beat. To see what happens, because randomness gives us great things in music. Another thing I love. Another anecdote related to randomness, in another setting, with producers. For example, with a random guy like Hozone, we discovered a thing that I love, which I haven’t done again, because many people don’t want to. Hozone would program some drums, he had the drums already in place, and they would form a loop, and then he’d put the bass in, and we’d have drums and a bass. There are many people who don’t like to do that. I love it. He had a folder with many samples ready to use. People usually like to work by ear, with what goes together, and I said, “No, I’ll try something, leave the drums loop with the bass playing, we’ll drag random samples over it and see what happens.” A Camarón sample, three guitar players and a singer. “Let’s see what happens.” Sometimes it didn’t fit, it was out of tune. Out. You discard them, but sometimes something would happen. Sometimes some vocals would fit and you wouldn’t have put them there, producing. But randomly that works with people who have samples already chopped. And have a library, and have a sample folder at the ready. But I’m passionate about randomness, in music and in art in general. Sometimes things you didn’t look for happen and it’s even more interesting. Serko Fu When you record a song, are you one of those who records a demo and then works at it, thinks it through? Or do you prefer the first time to just leave it untouched? Toteking I go with the first thing, I leave my raps as they are even if they’re saturated, and so they remain. Serko Fu It’s too hard to go back... Toteking No, no, no. I never record a song twice. People say, “No, but you can record it better.” No, no, no. Once I recorded it, I won’t do it again. That’s my opinion. If it’s a dud, so be it. And if there’s a part where you were louder and the signal got saturated, it stays. Baghira hates me for it. Serko Fu Have you ever thought about forming a rock band, or rapping with a band? Like Rage, or something like that. Toteking Sure, we’ve done it. Serko Fu But enough so it can be its own project going forwards? Toteking I thought about that many times, but it’s complicated, because what you get out of working with a band is not as stimulating for writing. Serko Fu Why? Toteking Because the band, in my opinion, is great for direct sound. It gains value playing what it already has, live. I’ve done it this year. The festivals I have this year, in the summer, I’m doing like four of them with a band. And of course, the band does covers, and occasionally we also improvise some bits, but it has to be a limited thing. When the band is covering your song or better yet, when they fatten your beat, it rocks and the feeling of playing with a band is incredible. That’s incredible. But when you lock yourself in the studio with a band, to create, it doesn’t rock. I don’t like it. I can’t write with a band, because everything is too raw. You lock yourself with some drums, a bass, a guitar, and they play like three tunes. Besides, the bands work with the concept of demos, of, “We’ll work this over later.” “OK, but I need something that gets me hard now, or I can’t write.” I can’t write with some guitar riff there. Then, it’s interesting because I latch onto a sample of some producer and I ask him, “Loop this for me,” and it’s an ugly, crude piano. But that does give me something to write on. Other times the band doesn’t have that. I couldn’t get that feeling with a band yet. Serko Fu And for example, now you’re telling me that you’ll be in festivals with a band, is it a band that’s covering your songs, in the same style as the instrumentals? Or could it have a more rock-like vibe? Toteking Sometimes they recreate songs that have that vibe already, like “Mentiras,” that’s perfect because it’s a rock sample. And other times they simply write arrangements over beats my DJ gives them. But sometimes what we do is take Jimi Hendrix classics, or good rock songs that we like and I adapt my raps over them, like I did with “Matemáticas” and the Kyuss song. And then it’s really cool. At the show it’s cool, and I think it’s a format in which a band works. Serko Fu And going back to the scene, I saw that you recently did a collab with these guys... Waor? Yeah, a duo. And I’ve seen that MC duos are a thing again. In some of your songs you say that Spanish rap is dead or that it’s dying, or you nod to that idea. Is that simply wordplay? Or do you really think that a time has come in which it’s stuck? And if so, why? Toteking Well, I don’t think it’s dead. I don’t remember, I was thinking where I could’ve said that, but yeah. I don’t think it’s dead, but I do think… And this is a reflection pertinent to the whole world, and it’s not only about rap but every genre that’s come out and everything they call urban music. What I do believe is that the scales were too uneven and that we live in a time that’s the opposite of before. We had a time in which, it’s true that it was a lot, rappers told tales, and talked about semi-intellectual concepts, rap songs that were about things, had a topic, and now we’ve gone over to the opposite side. You only hear stupid things at all times. And in every genre. I’m interested in literature, I’m interested in art, I read. And when I see people using such poor language I get bored. But it’s not that I think it’s wrong, perhaps I’m the problem. I’m 40 years old, and I’m no longer in tune with the kids. I want to say that before everything made you think, and now everything is for dancing and having sex. I think music is a huge spectrum, with thousands of things in the middle. They can’t be all lyrics for thinking and pondering life and reflecting, or all things for smoking and sniffing and having sex. I mean, between those two things there are a million others. And millions of people want to hear them. I don’t know, it’s all stupid, everywhere. It’s all nonsense. And it’s a shame. But I don’t think that it’s just rap, it’s in general, every genre of music. Serko Fu For example you mentioned that you’re 40 now, right? And you say that perhaps it’s that, “I’m 40 years old.” You’re one of the few MCs that are still active or relevant. Do you think that has to do with it? That perhaps music is like that, because there aren’t any more people doing things like this? Toteking Doing things like mine? Serko Fu No, I mean, things in a broader spectrum of topics. Maybe I’m wrong, and there are more people your age or from your generation. But I don’t think many of them are creating things. Why? Toteking Man, it’s a fact of life, in music, in art in general, you have to die, and new people have to come in. And if you don’t accept that you have a problem. I tell you, I don’t think that it’s so much because there aren’t many people from my generation saying things, or because there are too many new people. I don’t think that it’s an “old people or young people” problem. I think it’s a problem regarding general poverty, all around the world, at such high levels, that the intellectual level is underground. I mean, the songs, to give you an example, many hits that people all around the world listen to, are so poorly written and have grammatical errors, and they use only three words, man! I mean, a song that’s a bridge and a chorus, because they’re not songs, they repeat bridge and chorus, and then it’s over. In my time, at least, there were rappers, or people who threw text there. Nowadays the credit would have to go to the producer. Nowadays it shouldn’t be the singer’s song, it should be the producer’s song, because the ones doing things on top of that are speakers. Today we live a generation of people who just speak. They shout a couple sentences over a beat, “Give credit to the producer!” “You’re a clown who just shouts some words.” Do you get where I’m going with this? In those couple sentences there are 20 grammatical errors! You’re using your damn language wrong! I don’t understand what you’re saying! Of course, that’s my problem, I’m interested in other things. I come from listening to Juaninacka, that was like reading a poem. It was like looking at a painting. So, I don’t think it’s an age thing. I think everyone’s impoverished, worldwide, and that people sing about stupid bullsh-t. Serko Fu And what does ToteKing listen to nowadays? Let’s say, current music. Toteking I listen to the guy I think is the best writer in Spain right now, and he’s called Dheformer. He’s a kid from Cádiz, and he’s got talent. Pure talent. It’s amazing, I wish people could see him, but the guy is so authentic that he hides away. And he doesn’t show up, he just shows up when he feels like it. But I’d love for people to see him do freestyle. I mean, it’s a sight. Truly, there will come a day when someone sees that gaditano doing freestyle. I did a four-track EP with him. One of the best experiences I had with music. And it’s undoubtedly the best connection I felt with someone younger in my life. In which I felt younger, more like rapping, like 20 years ago. Dheformer was recording in my studio one of the verses, and I had recorded two verses and he had just one. And it was really cool! He improvised the whole second one. 16 bars in one go, ad-libbed. But recorded for work, not just to hang out. I’d never seen that before. Dheformer, in my opinion is the guy who writes best, unfortunately the music he makes is in a context that doesn’t fit with what’s popular now, and obviously he isn’t so well known. I don’t have doubts, in fact I’d say that I don’t want to listen to anyone else but him. Serko Fu And outside of Spain? Toteking I have a problem with the outside. The American school, which is the one I like the most, because I can listen to people from London, I can like Skepta songs, or the Foreign Beggars, I can like Sofiane songs, from France, or any other rapper from there, but I grew up with the American scene and I still listen to it. And there’s one weird thing, the rappers that I like the most who say the smartest things and whose songs are more my speed are really violent. But I tolerate them because it’s more like what I’m into. I like Roc Marciano, Westside Gunn, Conway… Serko Fu Gun talk. Toteking Right. So, gun talk all the time. They’re talking about guns and violence, and I don’t like that, but I do like them in a musical sense and the bars they have. They’re lyrically intelligent and they move the thing forward. I don’t know, that’s what I feel. I come from a time in which you sat next to a guy like Juani and I always bring him up, but it’s true, and Juani would rap and you’d get up from the couch, man. You’d stand up, man, you’d hold your head in your hands. And you wanted to lock yourself in your room and write something like it. And now it doesn’t matter what you write. The general feeling, what is there, there are many things, but what I’m saying is, it’s all the same in the end. I mean, the importance of the bars is dead. It’s completely meaningless, it’s like, you can say anything and they’ll look at the video. They’ll pay attention to something else. You know? Serko Fu And outside of rap, what do you listen to? Toteking Ah, outside of rap, I’m still listening to rock. Serko Fu Like what? Toteking Stoner. In my metal days I listened to several branches. I listened to death metal, to Norwegian black metal, they’re crazy, and classic rock, because that’s what I was born with, you know? But talking about metal rock, what’s been blowing my mind the last ten years is stoner and doom. Dense stuff, slow, and it has many loops to write with. In fact, for many of the things I write stoner is great background, because it’s 80 BPM. Dense, and the singer waits a whole minute before coming in, and that leaves a minute for you to write in. That’s what I listen to most. Serko Fu And on the production side? You worked with many producers in your country and from other countries, who would you like to work with next? What would you like to try out? Toteking That’s a subject that worries me less and less. Because there’s a feeling that you have to rap with successful people to feel successful. And for the last few years that hasn’t worried me at all. For instance, the most recent song I made with someone, I did it with Waor, and that’s because he’s a kid with whom I have improvised, in fact I think that’s how many of us have met. We met at a concert. I finish a concert, I like to get drunk and improvise. And being with the people there, I’ve done it with Natos, with Waor, with people I get along with, people I have good chemistry with. We’d see each other in the dressing rooms, we have a very similar way of thinking. But talking about Waor, or Dollar, I’m not interested in the part of a person that can give you... I need to rap with people I feel like rapping with. Even if I’m bringing him up a lot, the person that makes me write better and motivates me is Dheformer. Afterwards you do other collabs, or I may feel like doing them. I have another side, a more musical side. To get a guy to sing a reggae chorus or to sing R&B or something for you, but because you’re not looking to complement your poetry, but to embellish the song. And in that sense I don’t turn anyone away. I’m a guy who tries everything, I like to rap with everyone. I don’t go looking for someone in particular either, you know? Serko Fu And in beat making? Is there any beat maker you’d like to work with or any other thing you’d like to try? Toteking In truth, I don’t have any, I haven’t been looking online for producers for years, I’ve worked with M-Phazes from Australia. I worked with Oh No, and that was an achievement. With how much I like people from the West Coast, working with Oh No was amazing. I’ve always looked for people abroad to give the music some fresh air. To not work always with the same producers, but in truth, after 23 years doing this, I don’t need to go looking for anybody. I have four buddies who send me stuff, and whoever sends me something cool that inspires me I take it, but I don’t have the fantasy of looking for someone anymore. What I do notice is that a producer’s general catalog nowadays is not in harmony with what I’m looking for. It’s very complicated, and if I’m looking for a sample, without drums, or a thing almost without drums, to rap, a style very like what Roc Marciano does, you find like 3% of the producers doing that. And you find 98% of people who are sending me urban music that doesn’t inspire me to write at all. Serko Fu Just 808. Toteking That’s right! But I don’t hate 808s at all. I love its sound, but it has to be in a certain tone. In fact I look for beats that are like, for example, what Pusha T is doing now. He raps, you know. The album he made with Kanye is great. Daytona is a damn jewel. That is, for example, what I’d look for. That would inspire me to write. I can’t fool my own head anymore. Another thing I learned is that I can rap to any BPM. That was one of my challenges when I was 25. I wanted to have a lyric for every damn BPM. Because I had a fantasy, and it’s stupid, but I have many weird obsessions. I didn’t want to be caught with my pants down when they gave me an open mic. I guess that happens to many people who perform freestyle. I’d say, “Sh-t, I need a lyric because if one day a guy asks me to do a collab and the DJ plays any beat, I want to have something for that beat.” Because you can always improvise. But I wanted to have, my goal was to have a lyric for 60 BPM, and another for 112. I wanted to have every BPM under my control. And that’s something that doesn’t worry me as much, I’ve done it, it’s a past challenge. Serko Fu In one song, I remember you once said, and it’s not going to be literal, you can’t do anything without a manager, and La Mala gave you a number, or something like that? What would the manager’s role be, what would you look for in them? We were just talking about it, that you just changed your manager. I’d like you to share something with these guys. What is their role, what should they look for? In your case you had experience with different managers. Toteking In truth, I don’t have that much experience, I’ve only had three. Serko Fu You don’t want to tell the secrets. Toteking No, no, really there aren’t many secrets because no one can do magic, and I guess that’s obvious, right? People don’t do magic and they won’t sell anything you don’t have. I don’t know, maybe someone who besides looking for shows for you and getting you money, is able to understand your song, your music, because it’s true that if besides being your manager he knows what you want to say when you write, knows where you’re going, then he knows where to put you. Or where to sell you. Or where not to sell you, of course. Perhaps that’s important. And also if a manager is able to get into the artistic part, not to the point of telling you, “Don’t write this,” but that he can be honest, like with me, I’m a savage, if it were up to me I’d only release what I’ve recorded. I have four or five new songs usually already recorded. I have the studio at home and that’s what I like most about it. More than playing live, I like to record in my studio. If I didn’t have a guy stopping me I’d be releasing songs willy-nilly, without measuring times, without making it match anything, because I wasn’t born with that... That head for marketing
that these guys have. I don’t know how to say, “Damn, I’ll make a song about this and release it that day.” I don’t know how to do that, but there are people who do. So I think it’s good to have a manager for that. Serko Fu You were telling us that you started recording over that KRS track, you made a demo, La Alta Escuela, you had your solo stage, you invited your brother. You’ve been working in different ways. Now you’re with Sony? No longer, right? Toteking I left. Serko Fu OK. What could you share about the differences, pros and cons, between being independent and working with a corporation? Toteking Well, the only memory of Sony is that they paid for my damn house. I mean, Sony’s only good for that. A corporation is only good for taking their money. And people know that. A corporation doesn’t know about your music, doesn’t care about your music, doesn’t empathize, they’re geniuses of protocol. They’ll give you a good hug, they’ll take you out to eat fancy, they’ll put you in one hell of a recording studio. They’ll say, “Why don’t you collaborate with this person, it could turn out great.” And they’ll move you around. But afterwards, in the end, everything that results from that, or nearly everything, is laminated. My worse records resulted from being with Sony. My worse records, but the ones that gave me the most money. I bought a house cash with that money. But my music started to die when I started to work with them. Because it’s all bureaucracy. If you want to buy a beat you have to go through a hundred departments. If you have to collaborate with others you have to sign a copyright waiver form. Everything is a hassle. Everything is sh-t. The best is working with less resources but less problems. I was recording my first music video with Sony, and they made you change the shot because your sneakers were in the frame! A label on sneakers. “No, they aren’t paying for it.” And what do I care if they’re paying, damn, I want the sneakers in. Anyways, the shot is great, I don’t want to change it. Or they’d shoot a take on the street, and you’d have to ask for permission to every person in the frame, or take them out of focus, because they could sue. I mean, it’s a huge hassle. Sony screwed my creativity. I think my worst album is El Lado Oscuro De Gandhi. It was the first one I did with Sony. Afterwards, with time I can see that 78 is also a weak record. And Lebron turned out cool, I’d put that in my top three, but because I already knew how it worked by then. I’d put up with so much bullsh-t since I started there. Everything’s so slow, it’s exhausting. You don’t feel like writing anymore because it’s a bureaucratic mess. They do give out forward payments... That was the only good thing. Serko Fu Hey, if you say those albums you released with Sony were your least favorite ones, what would be Tote’s favorite album? What’s the album you’d say, “This one represents me?” I could delete my entire discography and this would be the one with which I feel more comfortable. Toteking Well, I wouldn’t erase it, I would keep three albums, Un Tipo Cualquiera, T.O.T.E. and Lebron. But if I had to keep just one, even if it’s not the sound that I like most, today the sound I identify with most is the one in Lebron. The newest one. I wrote it recently, too, and the productions are current, I like them better. But being honest with the feeling, Un Tipo Cualquiera is my best album. And that’s basically because I’d left my parents’ house, I’d started earning a little money with Musica Para Enfermos and Tu Madre Es Una Foca. I had some money, enough to pay rent at a friend’s house. So I left to live in Granada with him for a year. It’s my friend Paco. Precisely the one who got me into rap. He studied in Granada and I went with him. And alongside Paco, who was my buddy with whom I started out, I made the record I’m most fond of today. I lived in a tiny rented room, in a run-down house in Granada, an old building for rent, and I ate rice with tomatoes all day long, and everything was writing. And it was the first time I was out of my parents’ house. I could play really loud music, write with the beats at maximum volume, feel free. And that record, I remember it from that year in Granada, when that was all I did. I’d get up, write, leave some bars there go out to the street with my buddy, eat a shawarma, turn back, go for a walk. I was truly free, and that record is special to me. The truth is, time passes, and there are things I don’t like so much about it anymore, but it is the most special one. Serko Fu And if you had to pick a song? Which song would represent you? Toteking “Bartleby,” I guess. “Bartleby & Co.” yeah. It’s the one that better represents what’s inside me. In which I was better able to express things. Perhaps there are smarter bars and funnier ones, or more original ones in other songs. But this one has something special, I don’t know, it could be the best. The structure reminds me most of how it would be to write an article or an opinion piece for a paper. Hell, look, it’s a small bit and a pretty text that reads great. If you’d take out the music and read it, you’d go, “OK, this text is cool.” On its own, without the beat. Serko Fu Lastly, something you’d like to share with these guys? Toteking Well, I won’t teach you anything. On the contrary, I’d have to learn, and it’s what I do. I’m still in the music scene to spy on what they do. And besides if we’re in this context in which they do freestyle, OK then, I’ll shut up, these people rock, because they work with something that’s very attuned to what I like and that’s intelligence in music. And to have those bars you have to be smart. They’re much more in tune with what I hear, with what I like than the stupid music I was talking about before, that I personally find boring. So I can’t tell you much, but I could say that, to give an example that trick I have of writing with other kinds of loops, it works for me personally, I think it’s cool, if someone wants to try it out they’ll see, writing with other stuff, getting out of the genre, breaking down the genre is cool, to come back to it later on. Writing with completely different things and coming back to see what happens when you use a rap beat. Or, also, I don’t know... I won’t say to anyone don’t get into this or that, because if you’re 20 it’d be normal to want it. But it is true that time will pass. And you have to be careful about the things you record, because 20 years go by and you think, “Sh-t, what did I say here.” I regret some sexist things I said, they’re embarrassing. Or I regret some cheeky lyrics, almost capitalist lyrics, and very ugly, you know? And that gets recorded. I’d think twice about it. Besides that, I can’t think of anything else. Serko Fu Let’s give it up for my brother, ToteKing, I think it was a really good talk. [applause] Let’s move on to a Q&A. So, ready, point, shoot. Do we have someone over there? audience member From the standpoint of commitment with art, in your case, with writing, like a painter with their painting, I’ve always had mixed feelings between a commitment with your art that you so love and not wanting to give out certain information, a certain inner shadow that you perhaps have, because it isn’t necessary or because you don’t dare to face it. I don’t know, some do it and some don’t. I guess there’s stuff that even if it could inspire you for a good song, because it’s something really moving that you carry inside, I guess you won’t do it? Or you will, you spit everything out and that’s it, it’s done? Toteking That’s a good question, because there are feelings that hurt me every day. For instance, I wrote “Bartleby” with a pain and a feeling I had, it’s not a pose. This has been happening to me since the time... I’m talking a lot about him, but it’s true. From Juani’s time, because I never saw myself at his level. In fact I live thinking that I made it this far, maybe if we could talk about getting a little further, than the person who should have done it. I always think about that. When you express things that hurt afterwards it’s recorded and it comes back, it brings it back to mind. So I express it, but then I’m reminded of it. And many times I’ve had to use that. There are people who never use that. They don’t show it. It’s pretty, it’s cool, or you’re using it to monetize it, that could also be the case. These are questions I pose myself, they come back after you recorded it. In the moment I knew I was writing out of a real feeling, but I’m exposing myself. I always have this feeling, I think about quitting. Because of many problems I’ve had when my voice didn’t last when performing live, until I learned to tame it. Or when I saw I was getting further than other people that I considered better than me. So, the idea of quitting isn’t a pose. It’s always been with me, and those who know me, my partner, my close friends, they know, I’ve told them many times, “Man, I think I should quit, I’m not a good enough rapper.” Which means I’ve put myself out in that song. And I don’t regret releasing it, it’s cool, because it’s true that you never forget that. There are days when I get up, I’m washing my hands and I think, “I’m so embarrassed, I went all in in this song, I said everything.” And of course, many people don’t know you, and there are people who’ll say, “What a douche, look what he’s talking about just to sell or to make some noise.” I can rest easy in that sense, I know I didn’t do it for that. But it is true that those inner shadows, when you express them, it depends on how you do it. Some people don’t do it right. It’s hard, I don’t like that stuff at all. I mean, I can’t stand cheap triteness. If you’re pulling that, do it in style. But it’s a good question, I don’t know if it makes up for it. If you have something inside and you express it, man! You should first do it in a cool style, rapping, and then, it’ll come back. It’ll come back to your mind once and again. You’re giving away super personal information. And if you go out and someone recognizes you, you’re thinking, “Damn, they heard what I said in the song.” In this case, it’s not so intimate. Some people put themselves much more out there. And, damn, it’s a serious debate. Serko Fu Another question over there? No? Audience member You were talking about feelings, that’s where it all comes from, where inspiration is born.
But after all these years, I’ve listened to you for 15 years now, and there is some more time before that, at least ten years, I remember that in Un Tipo Cualquiera you talked about having rapped for around ten years. How do you find the motivation to say, “I’ll do another album, I’ll lock myself in and work.” Or perhaps it’s that, does the whole process of making the album fulfill you more than the final product? Toteking I found a balance, and I said, “OK, when I have something real to tell, I’ll have it, and I’ll hold onto it.” When I didn’t, I showed off with style, very much like a person doing freestyle. Besides, I’ve always been on that vibe, I like to do freestyle, as an amateur, but I’ve always done it. And what’s cool about rap is that it gives space for that. For example, one of my last singles, “Mira Cómo Tiemblan.” It’s absolutely worthless. It’s connected phrases, which I had a hell of a time recording. Relaxed, it’s simply going at it, writing smart bars, put them here and there, it’s just fun work, sport, like when you go to the gym. Right, so it’s cool that rap music allows that. Because some other genres are always about feelings. “That woman hurt me, this or that...” Rap allows for imagination. So I grab on to that, and I hope for something serious to come along. Why do I like this Lebron album? Unfortunately I lost my father two or three years ago, and I put that feeling in a song. And I feel very proud of the way I was able to face that in a song, because it was very hard. Going back to your question, I’ll talk about how I lost my buddy, who was my best friend and guide. Putting that in a song, it gives you a serious feeling, but it’s a cool feeling, too. That’s why I can keep recording albums, because in the Lebron album, for example, it’s 50-50 songs that have meaning and are made of feelings, and songs that are just fun and bars. I guess the day there’s nothing left to tell inside and everything is dumb, I’ll think about it. Also the good thing is that what motivates me to keep working in music is the fact that I don’t have to do albums any more. The truth is, I’m learning about that from you, about how music works now because it makes it easy. Because I have to do 15 songs now, what do I talk about now, man? I’ve talked about everything. I don’t know how many records I did, I don’t even remember. So, that’s the good thing about doing a song here and there. I’m not burdened by having to do so much. Audience member Well, thank you. Audience member What I wanted to say was, don’t you see, in that creativity, the pressure to say, “No, I won’t do this because it’s mainstream or whatever”? What you said about Dheformer, that he gets on the internet and doesn’t leave home. “I wish he was more mainstream!” Maybe it wouldn’t be Dheformer anymore, he wouldn’t do drum-less songs. And that’s cool too. What we look for is to keep doing what we want at every turn, because afterwards it’ll be cool to watch that past evolution. So, it’s good not to give into the pressure. Toteking Of course, but your profile is different. Because I was talking about lyrical idiocy... Of course, you’re in a perfect point, you make music. audience member Yeah, but we respect the format, anyway. Toteking No, but in that format we can talk about the issue too, because in the urban music format, well, “urban music,” yeah let’s call it whatever, there are many smart people. Many. Big Sean does some raps that blow your mind! I don’t know, Eminem... The song “No Favors” comes to mind, by Eminem with Big Sean. That’s current and it rocks, four minutes of rapping each! And it’s on the damn radio. My question is, why adapt to the damn radio, to the format, if we can do more modern music? The trendiest, newest things, but with something surprising. Why do we always have to sing about the same thing, man? There are more things to talk about, and people doing it. The last LP by Royce da 5’9” was awesome. In that LP he sings, raps, and it has feeling, it has meaning, and it’s smarter. I was talking about that, but it’s true that I don’t agree with saying, “No, no, I’m underground, I won’t do that,” because it’s true that you don’t know what could happen, for example, if Dheformer got put into a modern beat. And I know that he would crush it. But Kendrick is an example, Kendrick is giving an example worldwide. Kendrick, hot damn! We have much to talk about. I don’t know. Besides, as an artist, that thing I told you I had, I wanted to have a rap for every BPM, to defend myself from anything. Later on I knew I couldn’t do everything perfectly, but at least I tried. I could have a song that talked about a relationship failing, another that was only bars, another about hate, another about money. A spectrum. Because today many artists don’t have a spectrum. Their albums are about one subject, once and again, and it’s the same, and the next person does the same, in exactly the same way. So, my idea is to go that way. Not with the sound. In fact, I’m a consumer of music, I tell you. My advantage is that I come from metal, from jazz, from all kinds of music in my family, and today I consume anything that’s well made, anything I like, in any format. audience member How do you think trap and rap can coexist and find middle ground? What I mean is, it’s like taking a trap track, a violent one, with 808s, but that says something insightful. Do you think there could be such a perfect connection? Because I loved that in Spain, brother! It blew my mind! It’s not that I love rap or anything, but, hell! They are not musically different. Not putting limits on oneself. What do you think? Toteking I’m with you, with your speech. I’m a hundred percent with you. I’ll give you an example of that. A violent track, a lyrical track. Look, Neutro Shorty, the freestyle he did with TCM. It’s the best I’ve heard in Spanish, doing what you say, trap. I don’t really know what is trap and what isn’t anymore. It gives it a modern rap sound. That’s what Neutro Shorty does there. It’s spectacular. I think I’ve never heard a rap that good on a beat like that. And what you say, that’s what I’d love. For there to be options. I want there to be options. What you said, that’s truly having options, options for people who are singing pop, that’s music to be ignored, to do the dishes with, or to dance to, or have it playing in the background. Something for a little company, to go to the gym and have it there. And for there to be space for people who want to make lyrical stuff. It’s true, as well, I said it before, that we already have 20 years of lyrical stuff. It was time already for dancing and fooling around. Because Spanish rap around me was all “boom!” You know, there was no music, no fooling around. It was time already. But now we’ve made a complete turn, we’re on the opposite pole. So it’s cool that there are people like that. And man, I experienced what you tell me about Chile. I went to Caupolicán to sing, and when I rapped something a little more modern, songs from T.O.T.E., “Ahora Vivo De Esto” and so on, people turned their backs on me. There were people in Caupolicán, I’ll never forget. I’d never been scorned like that. I was rapping and there were people talking in groups, rapping among themselves, with their backs to me. Sure, and because it was “Ahora Vivo De Esto,” the beat was a bit modern for 2008. Of course, it’s like you say, and I agree, it should be that way. Audience member The same thing happens in Chile, if I put on, for example, an ad on YouTube, or I started to work with Vevo, they would tell me, “You’re a phony.” You know? But for example in Spain I was on YouTube and suddenly there was an ad of some rap, Natos Y Waor, and I’d go, “Yeah!” It’s so good that anyone who puts on YouTube, instead of any ad they could get rap and maybe they’ll like it. Maybe they’re not rappers. I think it’s the next step so that rap can keep growing. Because the same rappers make it stagnant and don’t let it grow, don’t let it become big. Toteking And rap is going to get better when you get it into other contexts. Just like if I try something with a rock band or if a guy gets a rap into another kind of music. It makes you rap differently. It’s not the same to rap 90 BPM boom bap, then rapping 90 BPM on a song that bounces and plays at half-time. They’re nothing alike, you have to take it differently. Not even the lyrics fit. Those kinds of beats force you to get in differently. That’s good for rap. audience member Can you still be hungry if your belly is full? You know? I mean, you’ve accomplished so much, is it just inertia? Because, personally, I sometimes go to places excited, but I have to say there’s a high percentage that’s just inertia, you know? And I know that a year ago I would’ve been really excited. Toteking If I tell you “Bartleby” is true, it’s because it’s really true. That’s another reason I’ve thought about quitting many times, because I think, “Why, dude?” I have my life sorted out. I don’t live like Gianluca Vacchi, but I live well. Then you say, “What for, I have a bunch of albums, I’ve collaborated with everyone, I’ve played on every damn festival multiple times.” I’ve felt this a thousand times. In fact, being from the generation I am, I’ve thought many times, “It’s time, dude.” I want to leave, and for it to be other people’s turn. Not having to go again to Viña, or that other festival. What I personally find motivating, and you said it in the coolest way, “with the belly full,” what I find motivating is exactly the same as what makes me continue going to the gym. I’m 40 years old, but I like looking at myself in the mirror, seeing myself fit, training, saying, “I’m cool.” It’s the same, I see rap just like that. I like to say, “I’m not going to be able to write better than that.” But a day comes, and you get up in the morning, “I feel like writing, I don’t know if I’ve eaten well, or gotten a good night’s sleep, today I want to get into the studio.” You do it, and it was three months since you last did. That day you create something. But it’s not ambition anymore. Not at all, it’s just inertia. Inertia, the same thing that gets me to train. Another thing. People are cowards. People don’t create to make music. They create because, “I’m going to make a song with you, you have 500,000 followers.” “I’m doing a song with you, because both our hypes combined make this much.” And people say, “Hey, I released a song.” For example, in my case, “Mira Cómo Tiemblan,” is close to a million now. Waor and Dollar’s, more modern,
doesn’t have even half that. What would many people I know do? “Do that, that works for him.” Music dies. Bravery dies. If everything was like that, nothing would be new. The guy who spoke before, from Chile. In Chile I listened to Ceaese. I liked it a lot, man. He’s brave for Chile’s scene. Ceaese is one of the few rappers... Who raps and takes you to another place. Utopic, for example. If you’re always afraid and pleasing whoever follows you, which in the end is money, because everything’s money, fame and so on. Then music would never do anything. But afterwards, for example, I think, my favorite Spanish rap album, the album that marked me the most, the one I learned the most from, and will learn the most from, after Juaninacka, for example, right? Another icon of mine, Sólo Los Solo, Todo El Mundo Lo Sabe. An album you can put on today and it’s marvelous. It’s perfect, beautiful. And it was made in a time every rapper talked, no one danced, everything was boombox, moving your head. It was Sólo Los Solo dancing, putting amazing stuff out there. It was lyrically rich, musically great. If they hadn’t opened that door, what would’ve happened? Where would we be? You have to be brave, and right now I understand that digital platforms give a lot of money, and doing collaborations with people lifts you up. But, dude, where is the desire to do music with others? And what you said before, too, I know that, for example, if after T.O.T.E. I had gone back to the format from Un Tipo Cualquiera, what’s more if I’d repeated Un Tipo Cualquiera, like many artists we know, and we all know who they are, they know they have a hit and repeat that style, five or six albums of the same stuff. We all know who we’re talking about, and it’s shameful. It’s all the same. I won’t, dude, I prefer to eat less. I prefer to play less, and for my cachet to be smaller. T.O.T.E. is a great album, and Un Tipo Cualquiera too. But I’m not going back. One shouldn’t go back. Sólo Los Solo didn’t, and if they didn’t, I won’t either. audience member Why do you think the song with Orozco was a front? Toteking Because I convinced him of that song in particular because I told him, “If we make a song, dude, I come from rock, let’s do rock, not pop.” And he agreed. We met up, and he’s a beautiful person. I had a great time with him and his people. And damn, I saw him playing guitar, I saw him singing, I went to one of his gigs. He gave a really amazing concert, I’d love to have lungs like his. We made the song using a rock format. He listened to rock, but it wasn’t really his speed. That is, it was an oasis in his music. His music is really identifiable with pop. A pop I hated. Audience member It’s like you took responsibility for his career even though what you made together was completely different. Toteking Right, and I specially had to take responsibility for what I’d said. Because I’m a guy who speaks without thinking. And I’d shot pop down since Tu Madre Es Una Foca. My brother and I hadn’t stopped. Now we’ve grown up and we’ve finally stopped. Afterwards, with age, you learn to tolerate everything, R&B, reggae, any music. But at first we were rappers, we were young, and we were all about rap, only rap, rap, rap. Of course, we hated everything else. Of course. At that time, after we made T.O.T.E., Orozco’s was around that time, when I’d already taken the leap with “Ahora Vivo De Esto” and I was emboldened. But right, afterwards, if people said, “Eh, what’s up,” yes I wanted to disguise it, but now I’ve the perspective of age, it’s a pain, and now you pay for it. You have to take it. Serko Fu We have one over there. Audience member In my case, I come from Panama, and there’s too much dance music over there, way too much, but there’s also rap. I read, I try to be informed and to be a smart person, to be knowledgeable and all that. But now I have a band, and I do rap, but I also make dance music. More than a question I want your opinion. Because I make dance music, but maybe many rap people don’t like that, either. And people who like dance music don’t like that it’s a band very much. Sometimes I make a chorus, very silly, a very silly chorus, that doesn’t have a lot to say, but it’s fulfilling. And at the same time I feel I’m not doing this nor that, I’m not doing anything at all, but it’s fulfilling, so I don’t know. I wanted an opinion about that. Toteking I don’t think, like I said before, I think it’s clear, I’m not an authority on the subject, really, I don’t have a clue. I used to be a long-haired dude doing heavy, listening to Metallica, and two years later I was rapping with a friend. I’m a guy who followed his gut and just kept moving forwards. But my gut tells me that right now the trend has reversed. Sometimes it’s cool if something has content that is funny rather than intellectual. For example, there are people in my country like Kinder Malo and Pimp Flaco, who do modern music, but they’re creative, and they have cool bars. But they have stuff that makes you think or at least smile. Let’s leave it at smile. Because I don’t want to seem like the typical serious guy. “Everything has to be smart or I can’t listen to it.” If I could dance I’d love to dance. I think there’s a place for everyone, but what’s happening now is that everything is very idiotic. Just my opinion, OK? I don’t think I’m an authority on the subject either, nor that anyone should listen to what I think. It’s true what you say about the silly chorus, but it works and it tells you something, I agree,
because that’s the essence... Many people want to disparage reggaeton. For example, to knock on that music they choose the Beatles, to appear snobbish. And the Beatles are the same thing! The Beatles’ songs are the same as reggaeton songs. They’re dumb pop songs saying, “Let me love you, let me love you,” and that’s it. Period. “Love me do. Love me do.” That’s it. I get it’s a silly chorus, but well sung. And a different thing is the harmony, the melody, the guy’s voice, pretty, sometimes the chorus is silly but the music is amazing. That counts. You say, “Hey, this is it, this sounds beautiful, I don’t need it to tell me a story.” I’m with all genres and I understand it all. What I don’t like are the extremes, you know? It bothered me in 1995, when it was all boom bap. I saw it coming too, in fact I used to tell my colleagues, and my brother can confirm this. I used to tell my colleagues in 2008 or 2009, around that time, “Guys, this has to change now, the scene needs freshening, because this is just boom bap and people ranting. Drilling into your head with a 24-line verse. We need someone to come, and say three silly things.” But now it’s the other extreme. audience member How do you think that affects the artist and art in general, and you specifically, as ToteKing? Or does it help? Because you always say, “Sh-t! All the time, say it, say it, say it, no filter.” You know? Toteking This is a segue from what we were talking about, cowardice, about people who walk back on their albums, because something has worked before and they want to keep repeating what has worked. People know, many artists know, we can bring to mind, anyone can bring to mind three or four from the top of the scene, who will never get involved in politics. They will always be politically correct. Because they know they could go through what I went through. For example, with Podemos after 15-M, and Podemos started rising, I had hopes, and like you said, I have no filter, I talked about it in every damn interview, I went to the Vistalegre event, I went to that park in Madrid where we sang, I said I would vote for them. I was with them. I wasn’t expecting it, but Nexa, who takes care of my social media accounts, he told me that three or four days later my numbers were drastically down. And people were leaving me private comments saying, “What a disappointment, what a shame, I’m right-wing and I listen to you since I was a kid, I’m burning your CDs.” “What’s up, you only rap for liberals, and not for conservative people?” I didn’t say that, I just said that I’m with them! I was brave, and that got my numbers down. And I don’t care about social media and those numbers. Those numbers are just numbers. And they’re down. It was funny, though, because, right, there’s a lot of people for whom everything is aseptic. They never get involved, they never say anything. Your country can be putting a rapper in jail for giving his opinion, or because an artist on Twitter takes a dump on God, they want to take him to court, like Willy. And people shut up. Because, “Oh, I’m afraid to lose numbers.” “Oh, it will get my numbers down.” Go to hell! The numbers. We’re going to die tomorrow, dickhead. People don’t get that. Serko Fu Let’s hear it for Tote.
