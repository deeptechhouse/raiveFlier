Detroit Techno and Chicago House: The American Origins of Rave Music

Chicago House Music (1984-1990)

House music originated in Chicago in the early-to-mid 1980s, evolving from the disco and electronic music played at underground clubs, particularly The Warehouse. DJ Frankie Knuckles, known as the "Godfather of House Music," held a residency at The Warehouse from 1977 to 1983, playing an eclectic mix of disco, Italo disco, and early electronic tracks, often extending and re-editing them with a Roland TR-909 drum machine. The name "house music" derives directly from The Warehouse.

After leaving The Warehouse, Knuckles opened The Power Plant, where he continued to develop the house sound. Meanwhile, Ron Hardy took over DJ duties at the renamed Music Box (formerly The Warehouse), playing a more raw, intense, and experimental style that pushed the boundaries of dance music.

Key Chicago house producers and DJs include:

Jesse Saunders — Often credited with producing the first house record, "On and On" (1984), on his own Jes Say Records label.

Marshall Jefferson — Produced "Move Your Body" (1986), often called "The House Music Anthem," which introduced piano house to the world. Also produced "Open Our Eyes" and co-produced Ten City's work.

Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers) — Created "Can You Feel It" and "Mystery of Love," which pioneered deep house with their lush pads and soulful melodies. His work as Mr. Fingers and Fingers Inc. (with Robert Owens and Ron Wilson) defined the deeper, more musical side of house.

Phuture (DJ Pierre, Spanky, Herb J) — Created "Acid Tracks" (1987), the first acid house record, which used the squelchy, resonant sound of the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. This single track spawned an entire genre.

Farley "Jackmaster" Funk — Chicago radio DJ on WBMX who helped popularize house music through his radio shows. Produced "Love Can't Turn Around" with Jesse Saunders.

Lil Louis — Produced "French Kiss" (1989), which became a massive international hit. Known for his innovative DJ techniques and elaborate live shows.

Steve "Silk" Hurley — Produced "Jack Your Body" (1987), which became the first house record to reach #1 on the UK Singles Chart.

DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn — Later Chicago figures who developed footwork and juke music, extending the Chicago electronic tradition into the 2000s and 2010s.

Key Chicago labels include: Trax Records (Larry Sherman), DJ International (Rocky Jones), Relief Records (Green Velvet/Cajmere), Dance Mania (Ray Barney and Jesse Saunders), and Mitchbal Records.

WBMX radio station, where DJs like Farley Jackmaster Funk, Lil Louis, and the Hot Mix 5 played house music mixes, was crucial in spreading the sound across Chicago and beyond.

Detroit Techno (1985-Present)

Detroit techno emerged in the mid-1980s from a small group of friends on the west side of Detroit who were inspired by European electronic music (Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder, Depeche Mode), Chicago house, Parliament-Funkadelic's Afrofuturism, and the post-industrial landscape of Detroit itself.

The Belleville Three — Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson — are universally recognized as the originators of Detroit techno:

Juan Atkins is considered the "Originator" of techno. As Cybotron (with Rick Davis), he released "Clear" (1983) and "Techno City" (1984), among the first true techno records. As Model 500, he released "No UFOs" (1985) on his own Metroplex Records, widely regarded as the first pure techno record. Atkins coined the term "techno" to describe the music, inspired by Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave.

Derrick May, the "Innovator," produced some of techno's most enduring tracks under his Rhythim Is Rhythim alias. "Strings of Life" (1987) is one of the most celebrated electronic music tracks ever recorded — its piano-driven euphoria and intricate programming became a touchstone for the genre. "Nude Photo" and "Icon" are also seminal works. May founded Transmat Records.

Kevin Saunderson, the "Elevator," brought techno to the mainstream. As Inner City (with vocalist Paris Grey), he produced "Big Fun" and "Good Life," which became international hits. He also recorded as E-Dancer, Reese (his "Just Want Another Chance" introduced the "Reese bass" — a detuned sawtooth bass sound that became foundational in jungle and drum and bass), and founded KMS Records.

The Second Wave of Detroit Techno

Jeff Mills, known as "The Wizard" from his early radio DJ days on WJLB, became one of the most influential techno DJs and producers in history. His blistering three-deck mixing style, often incorporating a Roland TR-909 drum machine played live, set the standard for techno DJing. He co-founded Underground Resistance with "Mad" Mike Banks before launching his own Axis Records. Albums like Waveform Transmission Vol. 1 and the Exhibitionist DVD series are landmarks.

"Mad" Mike Banks co-founded Underground Resistance (UR) with Jeff Mills in 1990. UR adopted a militant, anti-corporate ethos, releasing records with minimal artist credits and refusing mainstream media engagement. Their influence on techno philosophy and aesthetics — black balaclavas, an emphasis on collectivism over individualism — is immeasurable. Key UR releases include "Transition," "Jupiter Jazz," and the Galaxy 2 Galaxy project.

Robert Hood, also associated with UR's early period, pioneered minimal techno with his 1994 album Minimal Nation on M-Plant Records. His stripped-down approach — focusing on rhythm and subtle tonal variation — influenced a generation of producers.

Carl Craig founded Planet E Communications in 1991 and developed a style blending techno with jazz, ambient, and Detroit soul. His album More Songs About Food and Revolutionary Art and his remix work (including Daft Punk and Junior Boys) showcase his boundary-pushing approach.

Stacey Pullen, Richie Hawtin (Canadian but deeply connected to Detroit via his Windsor, Ontario proximity), Eddie Fowlkes (the so-called "fourth member" of the Belleville Three), DJ Bone, Moodymann (Kenny Dixon Jr.), Theo Parrish, and Omar S represent the continuing vitality of the Detroit electronic music scene.

Detroit Movement Festival (originally called DEMF — Detroit Electronic Music Festival) has been held annually in Hart Plaza since 2000, celebrating the city's techno heritage.

Key Detroit labels: Metroplex (Juan Atkins), Transmat (Derrick May), KMS (Kevin Saunderson), Underground Resistance (Mike Banks/Jeff Mills), Axis (Jeff Mills), Planet E (Carl Craig), M-Plant (Robert Hood), Submerge (distribution hub), and Third Ear (title unclear).

The Connection Between Chicago and Detroit

While often discussed separately, Chicago house and Detroit techno were deeply intertwined. The cities are only 280 miles apart, and DJs and producers frequently traveled between them. Derrick May has spoken extensively about hearing Ron Hardy play at the Music Box as a formative experience. Chicago's warmth and groove influenced Detroit's more abstract, futuristic approach, and vice versa. Together, these two cities created the foundation for virtually all electronic dance music that followed.
