Greg Wilson (2014)
Born and raised across the River Mersey from Liverpool, Greg Wilson is one of the original DJs who introduced British club audiences to the revolutionary dance music sounds coming out of New York City: disco, electro-funk, and hip-hop. A resident at Manchester’s legendary Hacienda, he introduced a whole new generation of clubbers to the art of (re-)editing, through his Credit To The Edit compilations and popular reel-to-reel sets.
In his talk at the 2014 RBMA Belfast Weekender, Wilson discussed his work on the famed Street Sounds compilations, record store snobs, DJing on TV, and much more.
Hosted by Todd Burns Hello and welcome to the final lecture of the Red Bull Music Academy Weekender, Belfast. I’m really honored to be joined by a DJ pioneer in the UK, Greg Wilson. Greg Wilson Hiya. Nice to meet you. Todd Burns I wanted to begin by connecting a little bit to Noel’s lecture. He talked and he did some mixing for the Street Sounds compilations back in mid ’80s, I guess? Greg Wilson Yeah, ’85, I think he would have done that. Todd Burns Yeah and you’ve written extensively about the impact of that compilation... Greg Wilson One of the series compilations, it first started, it was like the first kind of successful series of dance music compilations. It was the first series of dance compilations that were mixed as well. It was a guy called Morgan Khan who came up with the idea and I mean a lot of these tracks were only available on imports and they were expensive. Imports cost twice the amount of a British release. So if you were trying to buy these records, just as a normal person not as a DJ, it took a lot of money. So, he came up with the idea of let’s get these imports, put them on an album, maybe have eight tracks that would cost, you know, for the cost of two tracks and it was just a winner. He also did a series called Street Sounds which was dealing with the more kind of street soul based, and Hi-NRG. He made all sorts of spin offs but the electro series... (phone rings) my phone, let me turn that off. There we go. The electro series, which was basically the one that Noel was involved in, really caught the imagination and that was almost like the soundtrack for the original breakdance era. It was like, there was kids up and down the country who were like put ghetto blasters on the streets, were just like getting some lino about and break dancing and that was the perfect format. I would imagine cassette sales were probably as strong in many respects as vinyl sales because this is what the usage was. Later down the line when people started to look at the history of dance culture, especially with regards to what happened in the late ’80s, it was a huge emission, a massive omission that Street Sounds and what that represented wasn’t there within the story. It was kind of sidelined for the whole of Ibiza narrative of how things turned out. Todd Burns Yeah, I was looking at the comments to a post you’d put on your website and it was amazing to see five or six people that were like, “Yes, that was the compilation for me.” And like no one talks about it anymore. Greg Wilson I mean, these were chart albums. These weren’t like kind of something that sold a few thousand copies. These were getting in the Top 20 of the British album charts. These were huge records so it’s not surprising that a lot of people from that era, when they saw that being written about, it was like, “Well, yeah of course that happened.” But it was still very much... dance culture was very much an underground thing at the time still. It wasn’t until later that with the advent of the whole acid, house, rave scene, that it went overground and just became something that was more of a commercial force at that point. Todd Burns What’s been the impulse for you to... I mean obviously, your love of music, to get back into the DJing game, I understand that. What is the impulse for you to write about it so much on your website and document these things? Greg Wilson I mean, maybe it’s important to me that if I’m interested in history of music and for example, I’m massively into what happened in the ’60s and just obsessive. I can read any amount of books on that period of time. When you see things that... it’s almost like, I say this a lot, but to know the future first you must know the past. If it’s a wrong past or if it’s a past that’s missing big chunks of it, you can never look ahead properly. So, from my point of view, when I came back into DJing, which was just over ten years ago, a lot of the reason behind that was because, I’d got ... I’ve got a computer, started to go online and see what’s happening on the internet, realize that dance culture now was being documented in a historic way and seeing these omissions, and at that point, you could either just sit and moan about it or, in my case, I knew that I had all my archive material from the early ’80s period and I could put together a website that basically was a starting point that showed you how it led to that period of time and explained how things came out of that and so that’s what I did basically. I went back and that was what brought me back into DJing because when I had set the website up then people would say to me, “Would you like to DJ?” and then it became worthwhile to do that. There was a reason to do that and to kind of point a finger back to these times so people could see. Because as I say, up until that point, I think the narrative was very much the Ibiza one, which was really important, but it wasn’t about bringing the music back or like it was a Balearic edge to music, but a lot of people thought it was the house music that came back from Ibiza, whereas really what came back from Ibiza was ecstasy and the house music was already in place, but I mean that’s what it was. It was like on the underground scene, certainly in the north and Midlands. I mean there was a different lineage in London. Not many people were actually playing house, Noel and Morris were two of the people that were but, as he probably told you himself, there was a lot of resistance to that at the time in London whereas in the north of Midlands, there was already established networks between places like Sheffield, Nottingham, Birmingham, Leads, Bradford, Huddersfield, Manchester. There was an all-dayer scene that was going on. This goes back to the jazz funk days and house music was just played on the back of the electro. We’re talking about the electro albums. House initially, before there was a term house, it was just another form of electro that people found out came from a different city which happened to be Chicago and techno being Detroit as well, but it was all under the same umbrella. One of the first techno records was Cybotron, “Clear,” which was, I played myself in 1983 as an electro track. I wasn’t even aware it wasn’t. I didn’t know it was from a different city at the time. It just fitted in exactly with that and that’s what happened in the north and Midlands. The lineage in London was different. What broke it in London and made it different to what was happening, where we were was that the Rare Groove scene was so big, so that was almost like London’s northern soul, it was like going back and finding older records and creating a vibe and a scene around that and that was so huge during that kind of mid 80s period that took precedence on things and that caused a different narrative. I mean, house music predominantly from a London perspective, was originally played within the gay clubs whereas house music from the northern Midlands perspective was played in the black clubs so that’s probably the difference of the two. Todd Burns Yeah, I mean that was quite an interesting thing to me is that outside of London, black audiences in the UK at least in the north were cottoning on to house music first.
Speaker: Greg Wilson Yep. Todd Burns But it was the exact opposite. Why do you think house music in the north caught these audiences? Greg Wilson Well, I mean, as I say, I think it was the electro lineage. I think, electro also had a different effect in the north than the south and the reason for that was, don’t get me wrong, there was a lot of people in the south that were really into electro, but if you go back to say, 1982, when the first electro records appeared, how the scene worked, the black music scene in the UK was, the south and the north were separate. DJs didn’t kind of very often go between the two. It wasn’t like nowadays. Todd Burns So you didn’t play very much in London? Greg Wilson No, I never played at all in London. I played one time in London just before I stopped DJing and that was part of the Hacienda tour when I did Camden Palace, but never apart from that. I can think of two or three London DJs who came up to the north during that period. It was very rare, it was a real rare occurrence. In London, there was a group of DJs called the Soul Mafia: Chris Hill, Froggy, people like Pete Tong. Pete Tong was the young guy from the Soul Mafia, Jeff Young, you know Tom Holland, all these people. They had like a lot of power on the scene. They’d sussed out how to promote as well as to DJ almost. There was a company called Show Stopper Promotions, they were putting on weekenders, you know. I mean there was all-dayer events in the north and the south but they’d taken it to another level and I’d say that Chris Hill, the DJ Chris Hill, was probably the first superstar DJ in this country in this respect. He was way ahead of the curve with what he was doing. They were a powerful force and they had a lot of power within the media, so, Blues & Soul Magazine, the London stations that played black music, Radio London and Capital, Robby Vincent and Greg Edwards, these were all connected into the Soul Mafia and they were anti-electro. Their initial stance was that they didn’t like this, how they saw as kind of machine music. They thought it had no value with regards to soul. Todd Burns Just a little bit more robotic. Greg Wilson Yeah, I mean they just thought that, to their belief, soul was about songs and instrumentation and everything and this was something different. Whereas as a younger DJ, the way that I looked upon it was that, for me, I mean I was a big soul fan as a kid growing up and you know Stax Records and obviously Motown and stuff and you know the raw edge of something like Otis Redding and stuff like that, I could hear that in the electro, whereas the contemporary soul music of the time, you know, Luther Vandross, Alexander O’Neal, these people... incredible voices but it was over lush production and it was now aspirational black music. It was almost black yuppie music, in the sense that it was so smooth that it was almost bland in a sense, and this is what they were kind of hanging on to, whereas this new vibrant New York kind of cutting edge music being made from the streets, you know this is where... Todd Burns So it’s kind of the same attitude as well from the, this is the raw... Greg Wilson Yeah, that’s how I saw it and so we embraced it completely but it took longer. I mean for example, there was electro albums that you’re talking about, the first one was in October ‘83, whereas what’s seen as the track that really kicked off the whole electro thing, “Planet Rock” by Africa Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force, was that kind of an import in May ‘82. So we’re talking over a year. Morgan Khan saw the commercial possibility of this by then and he, by ‘84, like that old Soul Mafia thing had almost been swept aside and the new breed came through. That’s where DJs like Tim Westwood came from because they again, they embraced this new sound that was coming out and electro was the vehicle also that really brought hip-hop into its own. You know, things like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, “The Message,” you know, its kind of electronic backing, and Run DMC, you know one of their first big singles was It’s Like That, which was played as an electro track so a lot of hip-hop kind of emerged out of electro as well. And so, there was a massive change in London. I mean, the people that were playing this music were doing so, for example, on Pirate Radio and it was hidden in the shadows, whereas, for example, I did mixes for Piccadilly Radio playing this music and this was the second most popular commercial radio station in the country, outside of Capital Radio in London, so really we’d got it to a certain level already before London was like really embracing it and that was purely down, in my opinion, to the stranglehold on the scene that the Soul Mafia guys had. Todd Burns And you also mentioned, extended to the media in some sense, in the north obviously pirate radio was... Greg Wilson We didn’t have really Pirate Radio. Todd Burns No? Greg Wilson It was... that was more of a London phenomenon. I mean it was only later that a few pirates emerged, Manchester and places like that, but that wasn’t really what was happening from our side of things. Todd Burns So how was what you guys were doing up there spreading? How were these messages spreading? Greg Wilson Well, it was an underground scene which meant that if you didn’t read a magazine like Blues & Soul, if you didn’t listen, say if you were in Manchester, to Mike Shaft Show on Piccadilly Radio, or if you were in Liverpool, Terry Lennaine on Radio Merseyside, these different regions had DJs who were playing specialist black music. Or you hadn’t had the fortune of meeting somebody who hooked you into these kind of clubs that the... you probably missed them completely in a sense. You might not have even known that it was going on. But there was, as I say, there was this huge kind of subculture that developed over a period of time with whole series of... I mean at one point literary every weekend there was an all-dayer somewhere. So it was Sheffield this week, next week it was Nottingham, and the week after it was Manchester. And how all-dayers worked was that the most popular DJs in the region would come together in one place, so, and draw their crowds with them, I mean, we used to organize coaches for the people from our clubs, so it was this coming together. I mean, it’s a shame almost that something similar hasn’t existed more recently. I mean, I remember when I came back into things about ten years ago and this emerging disco scene and stuff, you’d see people doing events maybe in Newcastle or in Glasgow, Edinburgh and these kind of places and I’d always think what if those guys took a venue kind of central to all those and brought all the... and that’s what it was like, brought all their people together, because then everything starts to cross-pollinate from there. So the guys from Newcastle might check out the club in Glasgow, and so it worked on the club side people would go... Todd Burns These festivals, I mean obviously people were willing to travel to festivals... Greg Wilson Well, I think... Todd Burns To see things but ... Greg Wilson Festivals is the modern phenomenon I think. Todd Burns Yeah. Greg Wilson Festivals is where youth culture is now, it’s so big and it’s like a rite of passage for younger people and everything. I think this is where we are now, so in a sense, but this was more kind of bespoke because it was a certain type of music, it was, the DJs that worked on this, it was a specialist scene. I mean, for example, you had to buy these records. They didn’t come cheap. You know, I mean I’d spend 100 pounds worth records a week and that doesn’t seem a lot now, but back then most DJs were lucky if they got 20 pound a night. So I was fortunate. I could make a little bit more, I had a residency at Wigan Pier and I had Legend as well, but a lot of that money went into... you had to have the music. You literally... there was a famous occasion where I came up against... there was one shop in the north of England where you had to go for your records, if you were serious about being respected as a specialist black music DJ, and this place called Spin Inn in Manchester and that, you know I clashed a little bit with the manager. I was a young guy and maybe different ideas and you know as it goes, people see things in a different way and I remember one night I had gone into, I was at the club one night. It was a track by Arthur Adams called “You Got the Floor” and it was, somebody came in and said, “Have you got this Arthur Adams track, ‘You’ve Got the Floor?’” and I’m like, “No, but we’ll start.” And he’s like, “Oh yeah it’s great blah, blah, blah we heard it last night,” because there was another big club in town at the time called The Main Event. I’m thinking, “Why don’t I have this track?” So you know, the next day I ring the record shop, “Arthur Adams,‘You’ve Got the Floor’” “Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! We must have run out when you got in. We’ll put one aside for you.” “Okay.” So I go to pick my records up the next week and he said, “Oh, it hasn’t come in the shop yet.” So I’m thinking, “Oh God, I haven’t got this record and everyone’s raving about it.” and the night that I was working someone else comes up, “Have you got Arthur Adams, ‘You’ve Got the Floor?’” “I’m afraid I haven’t got it.” And this was like see a normal punter, not a DJ or anything and he said, “I’ve just got one in the car, I got it from Spin Inn yesterday.” I was livid. I actually played his copy that night, but I was like in there and saying, “What? Are you holding this record back?” And that made a decision in me. I went to the manager of the shop and I said, “Look...” and at that point he made sure that everything that came in I had it first. I was spending a lot of money, and it was important that I had these but it also made me think well, to kind of cover my back I used to shop in London as well and make sure I go to London every few weeks just to check off of that the things there and so you know it made me like look at things in a bit of a different way, but again the guy, later we clashed further along the line with the electro thing because he was completely anti-electro, and even put [a sign] in the shop window — although they were selling this music and there was massive demand for it — “electro shit chart,” it was like just grinding it down as though it was worthless and nothing. Todd Burns So he is selling it, he’s stocking it. Greg Wilson Yeah. Todd Burns But he’s saying you shouldn’t buy it or anything. Greg Wilson Exactly. I mean I remember going in and buying “Planet Rock” and I know that as
I walked out he was just looking at me and thinking, a fool parted with his money, because to them “Planet Rock” was coming from a Kraftwerk basis and it wasn’t black music to them, they didn’t see this as anything. It was just this novelty gimmicky thing. But really, now we know historically, this is, for me it’s one of the most important records of the 20th century because it is right at the start of that kind of electronic dance. It defined a new era, it defined a new way of making music, a new approach and everything and things changed after that forever. You can go back and look at pre-“Planet Rock” and the music that was being... I mean, I did a series online called “Early ’80s Floorfillers,” where again I went through all my record lists and I compiled a top ten for each month through ’82 and ’83 and if you started in the beginning of ’82, there’s still a lot of jazz records being played on the black music scene but you go to the end of that year and you’ve just seen a completely different, so many electronic tracks are coming into play and everything, and so there was a massive changeover at that point. Todd Burns Tell me about Wigan Pier, you mentioned that. Greg Wilson Yeah, Wigan Pier was a club... Todd Burns Very briefly. Greg Wilson It was a club in Wigan. A lot of people make the mistake of thinking it was Wigan Casino. Wigan Pier and Wigan Casino were chalk and cheese, they were two different things. Casino was an old dilapidated rundown ballroom playing ’60s rarities over a bit of a tinny old sound system. Wigan Pier was the state of the art American-style disco that they based around what was going on in New York, you know, your venues like your Paradise Garages and Studio 54s and these clubs had emerged in the ’70s, putting the sound equipment in, putting the emphasis on sound and lights and stuff like that. Todd Burns How did that happen in Wigan like what, who was going to New York and saying we need to have this here? Greg Wilson It was a complete accident apparently. The guy who owned the club, there was a stockist of disco equipment called Roger Squires in Manchester, and like every other club, he was going to Roger Squires and I don’t know how it happened but he bumped into somebody who worked for a company called Bacchus and Bacchus used to fit Hilton hotels and venues all around the world with the latest kind of equipment, and this guy persuaded him into, for example, getting the first laser system in a British club. I mean, it was way ahead of the curve. I’d gone to work in Europe by this point and when I say go to, it’s not like now where they fly you over there, put you in a nice hotel and look after you. I mean, you drove to Europe and you worked like six, seven nights a week in a club between 9 and 5 in the morning, and you slept in some grotty little backroom somewhere. There were loads of British DJs out there doing that at the time all over Scandinavia. You know I think, I often think that whole of kind of Scandinavian disco thing that came out, that’s part of the reason, because of these DJs that came before. And so, I was over there at the time, I decided I’m going to try and see how it works out there and, but I still wanted to be in the UK, but you know at the time, as I say, being a DJ it wasn’t a lucrative business. It wasn’t like it is now, and so I had a... as I said, ?I had my car out there and I had a bump in the car and had to bring the car back to get it repaired and changed. And while I was back, a guy that I’d met during my first trip to Norway, I tried to get in touch with him and found out he was at this club Wigan Pier and it was not far from where I was in Liverpool. So, I went to see him and I just saw this club and I was like, “Oh my god, this is it.” The just incredible kind of lighting and sound, and the DJ was on this balcony in this 15 foot high fiberglass frog, it was like this bizarre kind of... and they have monitors there and you never saw monitors in clubs at the time. It had vari-speed turntables that you didn’t see in clubs, or by and large in clubs, and everything was just set right and he told me that he was going to take a new club by the same company in Manchester called Legend and that there was going to be a vacancy for the job and he said, “Why don’t you audition for it, they’re doing auditions next week.” And I’m like, “But I’m going back out to Germany next week.” And I’m thinking, and I actually considered not going to Ger-, just to try to do the audition because I was so into it, but I couldn’t do that. I said to the owner, I said, “Look, can I, if I can give a cassette or something and send you a cassette as a demo.” And he said, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.” So that’s what I did and fortunately, I got the job on the back of that. I came to this working four nights a week residency straightaway, financially, as I said, most DJs they got I think, you got 20 quid for a night. That was a really good crack but, you know I was getting about like 42 pound, 50 a night and you know over the residency and I was doing the four nights there so I was like sorted on that level, and one of the nights was the jazz funk night, the Tuesday night, and that was my favorite night because it was the type of music that I was into. And then, a little later down the line, the same company that owned Legend, they had a Wednesday jazz funk night, and that was struggling. I’d done well and now the DJ there, a very famous DJ at the time called John Granz had left and gone to another club, taken the crowd with them, and I was given a failing club but managed to turn that and that became my great night, the Wednesday at Legend. Todd Burns How did you get into jazz funk originally? Greg Wilson Well, I mean, I was always like, from being very young, you know, black music found my brother and my sister. The records that they bought when they were in their teens, they were older than me, was like Stax Atlantic, Motown, Trojan Reggae stuff, and this is, I was kind of inheriting these great 7" singles and so that was, musically that was really my first love and I just followed that through and looked, when I started buying records myself, I was about 11 when I started buying records. I’d go and look round, I’d go in the bargain bins and find these soul records and then I’d start listening to the radio shows, reading Blues and Soul Magazine. And so that was the direction, by the time I started DJing myself, which was in ’75 and coming to the end of the ’70s, I think what happened was that disco, obviously I just started as disco was coming in, I think the month I started was the month Donna Summer released “I Love to Love You Baby,” so it’s kind of the start of that real era coming through. But when Saturday night fever came out, although at first it was great that here was a film that was depicting this kind of culture that we were a part of, very quickly it brought in what we saw was like a wrong... people latching onto the film, people dressing in you know like sometimes... like Medallion Man and stuff and it was getting a bit crassy, you know. I always see it that way, that in the end the symbolism of what disco originally was, which was like an afro hair, black kit you know like kind of dancing to, you know it became like this white suited, white guy with his hand in the air, you know, and it changed with that and it made it very uncool all of a sudden. There was those connotations with it and I think a lot the kind of cooler kids at that point started moving towards jazz funk and listening to that music so that, I kind of went with that lineage and although I wasn’t in a venue of the level of a Wigan here or a Legend at the time, I was still in my home town, that I was able to start to introduce these records and play them within that and one of my proudest moments was that Blues & Soul actually come to my little backwater club and recommended it, just before I went abroad and everything. So yeah, I aspired to that. I mean, I always tell this story, I mean when I did the Academy in Melbourne back about what, must have been about eight years ago, I told the story about when in Liverpool there was a club called the Timepiece in the ’70s and it was a funk club, and the DJ was a guy called Les Spaine and it was predominantly a black club, and I went there when I was sixteen. I was taken in by some older DJs and it was one of those occasions where you go into an environment and all of a sudden you’re thinking, “Oh am I out of my depth here?” Because there were very few white people and I hadn’t been in an environment as a white guy where I was in the minority. It helped me understand how a lot of black people must have felt being put in a situation where they were in the minority in most circumstances. But amidst that was the music that was playing was exactly what I was into, exactly what I was about and that this DJ, Les Spaine, he was like a larger than life character and he did all-nighters and so all the like Liverpool DJs from different clubs would come at the end of their night and they all stood round the booth and looking up to him and asking, “What’s that record?” and writing it down. He was quite happy to give them this information, but he was like the don, but he was so welcoming to everyone. So, and like me as a sixteen year old, introduced to him, treated me with respect, you know not like I was some little nothing... I always felt that with him. I mean, he’s still a friend to this day. He went on to work for Motown and he managed the Reggae band Aswad, and he’s still involved in the music business today. And when I saw what was going on there, that was it, that’s what I wanted, that’s what I aspired to. I wanted something like I saw there, and that’s what I eventually managed to get at Legend, I managed get my Timepiece when I, a little bit later down the line. Todd Burns You mentioned, you keep mentioning Blues & Soul Magazine. How important was that at the time? Greg Wilson Blues & Soul was the DJ’s bible. There was no Mixmag, DJ magazine, all those things then. So, Blues & Soul... and one of the big things in Blues & Soul was the DJ, this is where I heard about DJs like Chris Hill and these guys in London, was that they, there was charts, a DJ could submit a chart, a top ten. I put mine in all the time, and so there’d be these two pages of DJ charts that you could read for a start. So that alongside with Record Mirror, there was a disco page in Record Mirror by a guy called James Hamilton. He’s probably one of the most important people ever in British dance culture, but not many people would know. He dates back to the early ’60s and the R&B scene, at a place called the Scene in London. And so this was where your sources of information came from. Like Blues & Soul, for example, would print a UK soul chart, which were all the records released in the UK but also the US. So you’d see what was released there, and you know, latest record reviews, all sorts of kind of interviews and stuff like that. A lot of adverts for clubs, clubs advertising... it was at that point in time, it was the DJ bible. You had to, again, if you were a specialist in black music, you had to read that. There was no way around it. Todd Burns Why was James Hamilton so important? Greg Wilson For a start, he was with a guy called Guy Stevens. When I say the foundation of UK club culture, I think you can take it to the scene in London which was the Mod Club of the early 60s. You can also take it to the Twisted Wheel in Manchester with a guy called Roger Eagles. These were the first people that were importing American records and it wasn’t enough to just buy what’s coming out in Britain, they had to get to source and get these records, so Twisted Wheel for example, that’s where northern soul comes from. It’s from that venue where eventually, they got so obsessive about this music that they wanted to dig back and back and find these rarer records and it came through from there. James Hamilton was one of the DJs at the scene but later turns up at the start of the disco era writing for Record Mirrors. Before that, he was doing US import reviews for Record Mirrors. Record Mirrors is a really important magazine in terms of dance music. They were always pro-dance. Magazines like say NME or Melody Maker, they ignored it probably until really the ’80s and hip-hop came through and then the rave scene eventually, but Record Mirror was always supportive of disco and dance music as it evolved. James Hamilton was central, he was the guy who... BPMs, he started listing beats per minute obsessively. You’d see him, he’s this big, tall, he was about 6 foot 6, larger than life, mad character and a very far back voice and he’d stand there in Groove Records in London with a stopwatch just BPMing records, counting the BPMs and he went on an obsessive mission and he was the one who I think pushed mixing in the UK because initially it was just seen as a fad from America, and British DJs used the microphone and nobody saw the reason to change, and we didn’t have the equipment, the vari-speed turntables. So the idea of mixing came out and people gave it a go on these belt-driven turns and tried to touch... the needle would jump and so everyone stuck to that, but he pushed that through and pushed that through until it eventually it really started to kind of come in. He was a real champion of New York dance culture as well and so many different things with him. He has become obscured in the history but he’s massive, he’s one of the key figures. Without him, it would be a different culture. Todd Burns One of the things that I think is regarded as one of your massive contributions to dance music history is that you were the first DJ on television to mix. Obviously people can go and look up that story. I just wonder if you remember that day specifically. Greg Wilson Yeah, I remember that day, it was the scariest day of my life. I see people now, like Boiler Room and all that and they do that. It was like that, but before it was hard for me to get my head round to that Boiler Room at first, the idea that somebody wants to watch a DJ play because when I started out, DJs weren’t on a kind of central stage and everyone looking at them, they were in a dark corner. I actually prefer that, just the music speaking for itself, DJ out of the way. So all of a sudden, there’s this massive scrutiny. I remember how it all came about. I did the Wednesdays at Legend which was like the specialist black music night and there was a new British release by an artist called David Joseph, who’d had success previously with a band called High Tension, but this was his first solo single. I’d been sent copies of it by the record company, I got records from all the British companies, but it was only tracks like this that I play on British releases, all this stuff was imported. It was a British artist like this and it was a really good track, “You Can’t Hide Your Love.” What I used to do at the time, I’d started mixing by this point, I used to play around with two copies of a record. I’d run one behind the other, either four beats, two beats or a beat and switch it around, maybe kind of extend it, it was almost kind of like a live remix in a sense. This night, David Joseph had come to Manchester to do a personal appearance. We used to get artists who’d just come in, we didn’t even pay them. We had people like Gwen Guthrie, Oliver Cheatham, even Kool and the Gang came in at one point. The record company would get them in there to help promote any number of British artists, of which David Joseph was one. Now, The Tube was in Newcastle, the TV program. It was the biggest music program at the time on the TV and they were going to have him on. They were going to do an outside broadcast from Camden Palace. I was actually in the studio in Newcastle. They were going to have him on for this, they wanted to come check him out and see what he did. They came to Legend and they heard me playing these two copies of the record and they went, “That might be an idea to have him on in Newcastle playing the record and then go to David Joseph in Camden Palace.” So they approached me and they said, “How do you fancy doing it?” And of course you go, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” And then you go home, you go, “Oh, my God. I’m going to be doing this in front of all of my contemporaries, what if it goes wrong? Oh no.” It’s like the fear of the situation at the time, what if I look a right melon if something happens? And I remember going there and I took my equipment, I had this console, I took my Revox up there and we set it all up, and Jools Holland was the guy who did the interview, and all through the conversation and everything before we even were interviewing, I’m just looking at my decks and I’ve got everything cued up and what was scaring me more than anything was there was a guy with a hand held camera and he was going incredibly close to things. And I’m thinking, “Please don’t bang that.” So, it got to the point where he said 10 seconds before on air and I think that’s the most fearful moment of my life, just “Oh God, I’ve got to go for this.” And so, did it, and the cameraman did bang it and the record held and that SL 1200... just the steadiness of it, it saved my life because if that would have jumped, I would have had to kind of be on the hop trying to... I wasn’t no turntablist who could just drop the needle on the right beat or anything. I was still kind of infancy of mixing and stuff. And everything went fine in the end and it worked out great. I remember I did a club in Manchester that night called The Exit. And I remember as I walked in a lot of people kind of patting me on the back and saying, “Well done.” And it had been a success and everything. It’s funny looking at the footage now because the people in the studio, there’s no interest, they are just not even bothered. They’re going, “What was this kind of DJ thing going on?” Because they were kind of New Romantic-y kids and stuff like that. Obviously from a DJ... anyone who was DJ who saw it, it kind of had an effect on them and people like Norman Cook talked about seeing it. Even people thinking about, “Oh, I could do that and give it a go.” It opened up the idea of mixing to more people. Todd Burns You mentioned Revox. Can you tell us what that is? Greg Wilson Right. Sorry. Revox is Revox B77, reel-to-reel tape recorder. It’s what I use now. I kind of record samples... Todd Burns So you’re still using this thing? Greg Wilson Yes, the same unit from back in the early ’80s. I started doing mixes for radio, once I became known as somebody who mixed and you got to remember, at the time, there was only probably a handful of people in the country who were seen as taking this direction seriously. People like Froggy in London, James Hamilton for sure, one or two other people Ian Levine at the Heaven gay club in London, but it wasn’t something that was being done. I don’t think mixing really took over with the majority of DJs until the rave period. It wasn’t until the late ’80s, there was still a lot of DJs using the microphone to that point. The original mixes I did the for the radio were literally as live, but they recorded them in the day so I go into Legend in the day, they come and they bring one of these Revox B77 units. What they were used for, these were portable editing units that were used by news departments who on the hop, they kind of edit as they were going along. They were built for that purpose. They’d record the mix, take it back to the studio and did what they called top-and-tailor which was put blank tape at the beginning and the end so it was all broadcast ready to be played, and that was it. It was like a live mix at first. And then there was one occasion where they didn’t have anyone back at the studio to edit it. I managed to get myself into an editing booth and I’d been shown the rudiments of tape editing. I just really got into it, started reversing bits of tape, playing around and messing with beats, stuff like that, just loved it. That took me down that kind of path which was almost like a producer’s man. Which is where I wanted to work more slowly with the music and the mixes got to become more intricate, they’d take me longer to do. No longer was it as live, it was taking a whole night to kind of put something together and becoming more and more experimental all the time. I’d bought my own and I bought my SL-1200s. This is at a time where only a couple of clubs in the country has SL-1200s and nobody had them, nobody bought them. I think Froggy in London would have had a pair, then I had a pair and so I had my own kind of little DJ studio that I was working on, making my mixes and the Revox was integral to that, because apart from... we would record into it then, that was the format you recorded to, and then I could edit things up and do little kind of tricks and fancy things. Also, if you put it into record, and I still do this now, if you put it into record, and turn the channel up so you’re recording what’s playing out and then you pull that channel up, it’s creating an infinity loop, so that’s the dub effect. That’s what the Jamaicans discovered in the 70s with dub and everything. They were doing so, I use it in that way as well, it has those two purposes for me. Todd Burns Why do you still use it? We have the technology today to do those things on the computer, obviously. What’s the appeal for you still to be bringing this out? Greg Wilson I suppose it’s like an instrument. It’s like a guitarist, well, why are you taking the guitar when you could use a keyboard sampler to sample things through. That’s their kind of instrument, that’s what they are comfortable with. I spin these sounds and it’s the way I do it. I have an affinity and a feeling for it. I suppose that if I wanted to, I could use bits of equipment that would do something similar to what I do but it wouldn’t be the same thing, it’d be similar. I also like the idea... when I started DJing, I mean I never used to use a Revox like that back then. I used it more for mixes, for radio mixes then. I didn’t use it in a live sense so much. I did on The Tube and stuff. When I come back and started again, it was like, “How am I going to do this? Am I going to go off CD? Am I going to go off vinyl?” A lot of my records were stolen in the mid-’80s after I’d stopped DJing, so there was gaps to be filled. Maybe I have them on CD. So I have some stuff on CD, some on vinyl. The third option that appeared was laptop. And in the end I plumbed for that because I wanted to do edits and stuff like that so I thought, “Right. I can put everything together, I can rip my vinyl into there, rip my CDs into there, so everything’s in one place, I can do my edits.” But that was kind of like modern technology, that was like... And at the time, people were still a bit kind of weird about it. They didn’t like DJ playing off laptops and stuff. And I liked the idea of having this antiquated technology against the kind of current stuff. It was that balance. That’s the same in the way I present the music. So, although I’m taking music from the past, via the re-edits and everything, it’s being presented in a contemporary way, so it’s not just... I didn’t want to fall into a nostalgia trap of had I come back into it and played the music in the same way as I used to play it, I think there would have been an interest to a certain level where people would have maybe checked me out, ticked me off, “I’ve seen him, let’s then move on to the next guy.” But there wouldn’t have been any longevity for me, there wouldn’t have been any shelf-life. Embracing the edits culture, which was second nature, because that’s what I was doing back then, and I was very fortunate that I wasn’t even aware because I was so out of the loop with things in the years before I came back into DJing. I hadn’t even realized that this re-edits thing was starting to emerge. So, walking back into it, it was just like hand in glove for me. That enabled me, as I say, to draw from the past but do it in a way with an eye on the future. Todd Burns You’ve took a long break from DJing but now you’ve been back for a while, a little bit. I’m wondering, now that you’ve got a handle on things and you’re back and you’re into it, what are you looking forward to now? Now that you’ve gotten over the shock of whatever the dance music scene looks like and all these things. Now what? Greg Wilson A few years ago, I was still thinking of myself as new back into this, and then you come to the realization that you’ve been doing it longer than you did the first time around. It was between ‘75 and ‘83 so it was 8 years. Now I’m 10 years into this. So, the type of nature that I’ve got, it’s got to be for a reason. I can’t just do it to make money or go through the motions. I’d hate it, I’d rebel against it within myself. That’s why one of the reasons why I probably stopped the first time because it was like falling out of love with it. There’s got to be something that underpins that. Now it’s 10 years, it’s a decade. I could quite happily in many respects go and do my DJing where I get very well paid for what I do. In the week, I could put my slippers on and chill out in front of the telly, but that wouldn’t work for me. I’d fall into those bad ways, so I needed another challenge. When I wasn’t a DJ, I was working in production and management, record labels, those kind of things. I decided that I wanted to make moves back into that direction and as it worked out, somebody that I worked with in the past, a guy called Kermit, who I worked with with a band called The Ruthless Rap Assassins at the back end of the ’80s, early ’90s, and he later went on to have big success with Black Grape with Shaun Ryder from The Happy Mondays, that he had some stuff that he’d done that I was really into and that was the fuse point and I’ve set up a label now called Super Weird Substance, and two dates into a five date mini-tour which is to open the label up. We did Glasgow last night, Manchester last week, and we’re off to Liverpool, Bristol and London before I think, November the 1st, the last gig. In a sense, it’s kind of, it’s a whole mad, chaotic situation of dealing with loads of people. Because not only the band, but you’ve got to deal with the people working around the band, to put all this on. The last few weeks have been, “Why have I done this? Why do I want to kind of take all this on?” But really... Todd Burns Why do you want to take it on again? Greg Wilson Because I think, to keep fresh in what you’re doing, you have to challenge yourself and there’s unfinished business in that area because when I came to the end of my line with the music business, so to speak, the music business is a hard, cruel business because music’s about emotion. You know, you put your heart and soul into something, and then you go into this machine of the music business, and really they’re interested in pounds, shillings, and pence. They’ll go with the artistic side if it sells, but they don’t mind, they’re selling cans of beans, and if it’s a nice flavor, that’s great, but they don’t care if it’s a bit grotty as long as they can get their money in. So they’re coming from a different perspective than we are. And the end of it for me, it ended hard. I had a project, we were signed to Polydor, for one reason or another it didn’t work out, and I found myself left with like a load of tracks that I’d worked on, you know, put everything into it for a period of about two or three years, that never saw the light of day. That only my friends, the people around us, ever got to hear. And that hurt more than anything. And so later down the line, that’s why when the digital age kicked in and the internet, and there was the possibility of sharing music and stuff, that I embraced that. I’d rather give it away than be put in that position that you put all that work in and that energy and effort and nobody ever gets to hear it. At this point in time I think that, as I say, financially for my DJ work, it enables me the opportunity to take a risk with this. Without it being... in the past I’d take risks with everything. I’d risk it all. I’d risk any money I had on on trying... because back then you had to get a studio. It wasn’t a case of open your computer and making a track. If you made a track, you’d have to book a studio, and they weren’t cheap. So it might cost you a thousand pounds to go in and do a couple of tracks. To a certain level, you weren’t even... finished mastering level with it. You were either looking to find finance to do that or you were pretty much doing it yourself. You were just finding money from somewhere. Whereas now it’s different. As I say, I could afford to put a little bit of money aside and say, “Let’s have a go at this.” And that’s where I’m at with it at the minute. Todd Burns We were talking earlier backstage about the event, and it seems like obviously you’re DJing at them, but there’s a live band, and then there’s all these other elements. Is that something that’s important to you to have this? Greg Wilson Yeah, I like the idea of bringing in different aspects and kind of shaking things up a little bit. And the fact that what we’re doing is we’re starting off with talks, we’re having a guest in and I’m kind of talking and Kermit who’s in Blind Arcade, then it moves into a more kind of an art space thing where we invite different artists to contribute, like drawing influence from what we’re doing. With DJ playing, but not so much in terms of wanting to fill a dancefloor, but just playing good music. Then the band plays. Then it goes into a normal club thing at the end, and I’ll finish it off. So, it’s a multimedia thing. We call them Super Weird Happenings. The label’s called Super Weird Substance. And the term “happening” is a ’60s term that was basically artistic events with this spontaneity to them. And these things were happening back then, and that’s what I’m trying to kind of touch into. Each one will be different. It finds its own direction. It’s not set in stone. It’s not perfectly rehearsed. It’s something that allows that kind of spontaneity. And they’ve been like mad, this kind of glorious chaos which everyone’s like really enjoyed. Todd Burns You said you had a barber last night? Greg Wilson Yeah. Last night one of the artists was a barber, that came in and just did these mad kind of extreme haircuts with people, if they kind of wanted to kind of put themselves in his chair, and so, yeah. It’s one of those where you’re looking around and you see things that you wouldn’t normally see in a club environment. Really what I want to do with this is take it into festivals. I think its natural state is within a festival. I want to take an area of a festival, curate the day, program it, so as I say, in the day would start off, say you’d be in the festival, you’d get out of your bed after a late night the night before, but you could come in and listen to some interesting talk, what was going on with people, and then as I say, different artistic things happening like bands playing. And eventually into a full on kind of club vibe. That’s where I see it going and hopefully that’s what I’m going to be doing next year with it. Plus, one stand-alone, one-off events here and there at interesting places. Todd Burns Cool. I’d like to open up to questions. Greg Wilson Mmhmm. Todd Burns See if anyone has anything they’d like to know about Greg or his career. Anyone... have anything? Greg Wilson Don’t be shy. (laughs) Audience Member (inaudible) Greg Wilson I think Balearic really initially was basically in Ibiza, DJs playing pop music, and rock music, rather than black dance music. That was happening in the UK. There were plenty of places that were doing that. But obviously it went under the term Balearic. I think that what was recognized in Ibiza, the island and the setting and everything, was a certain spirit to music that was brought back and that’s where the term derives from, of course. I think Balearic was important because we were quite snobby about pop music as DJs. You know, black music was the real stuff. That was the proper dance music. All this kind of boop-boop, there are obviously great dance records that come from that direction, so I think it had an importance in that respect, in maybe telling us that it didn’t have to be one way or whatever. Todd Burns But you certainly wouldn’t identify yourself as one? Greg Wilson Well, I mean, interestingly, I think it was Terry Farley, he described me as a Balearic DJ these days. I think I could see what he means, that I’m picking from a wide spectrum of music and a wide history of music, and it can come from anywhere. Whereas I’d say in the past I was a different kind of DJ. That it had to be generally imported out of somewhere like New York, it was by black or Latino artists. You know, you had all these stipulations. I mean, one of the things about when I was a DJ at Legend, you know I always look back and I’m always a bit sad that I never played a track by Yazoo, it was the François Kevorkian mix of “Situation.” And that felt like one step too far at the time. I mean, because I took so much stick for playing things like Buffalo Gals by Malcolm McLaren, because on the black music side they were like, “Wasn’t he the manager of the Sex Pistols? You’re playing this punk guy.” They just saw you moving kind of away from it. So the idea of playing British pop like Yazoo, but I should have done it, really. And people like Yello, the Swiss band and stuff. I think I actually did play a couple of Yello tracks towards the end of that time. There was a degree of snobbishness, and I think that in Ibiza, with ecstasy, in that environment, it opened it up. And those guys that witnessed that and brought it back, that’s what they experienced and I think it was an important addition and again, it was reminding us that music’s music. And don’t get too kind of tied up in what you think’s like credible and not credible in a sense. Just listen and you hear it. Todd Burns Is there any other questions? Audience Member (inaudible) Greg Wilson Well, I mean, straight away really what it does is it enables it to be brought into a current context. I mean, say for example it might be a ’70s track, ’70s disco track, but it’s got like a real drummer, it’s not in strict time, so from a mixing point of view, it’s not easy to mix for a starter. God knows how those guys in the ’70s mixed a lot of the... it must have been like a couple of beats and the next record played, you know, if you listened back, if you managed to get a window back in on that time. So what this does, it enables you to contemporize a classic track. I think, say for example in the ’90s, you know a lot of older records were... people were using them, but they were just putting straight 4/4 house beat and housing them up. That’s not what’s happening now. It’s almost like they appreciate that these are great records in their own sense, and there’s nothing wrong with them as such, apart from the fact that they need to mix into them, need to kind of make... maybe they need to add some bottom end that wasn’t about at that time to make them sound right in that environment. And that’s what it does. What I’ve noticed down the years is how the audience has got younger year on year and people come in that connect with this type of music that now we’re getting into like people who are teenagers, who are getting into hearing mixes online and hearing these edits and really getting into them and stuff. You can’t go to somebody who’s young and say, “Listen, you’ve got to kind of... in my day it was all better and this music then...“ You’ll lose them straightaway. You’ve got to meet them and be respectful to where they’re coming from. So if you can present that music to them in a way that fits in with now, i.e. you can mix it in with what you’re doing, and again, it’s contemporary tracks as well, they’ll warm to it. Because really, it’s just great music. When it boils down to it, it’s just... I also think, I’ve had a few conversations this year about... especially in Ibiza, because there was a feeling in Ibiza when people drive in between gigs and people at the club that are working and stuff, there’s real dissatisfaction with the music there. And I think it’s come from the whole EDM thing, that now, even though I think that Ibiza was part of the problem, it’s gone too far for them, and promoters and stuff are all of a sudden saying, “I don’t even like the music that we’re playing in the clubs anymore.” It’s got to that stage. I was just doing what I did and playing my thing, and they were like as though I was doing something new, although I’ve been doing it ever since I’ve come back. But it’s the emotion within it. And I think like the vocals, the musicianship, these emotional aspects of the music that ... and I was talking to a DJ from Berlin who put it into terms that music has been technical for too long. Too technical for too long. And we are coming to a more emotional period. Maybe because of the austerity of the times, we’re living in strange times, and I think people need a kind of uplift, and all of a sudden these tracks take on a different context. They allow people to go out, let go of everything that’s going on in the world. Whereas a lot of dance music is very intricate in terms of its own little niche. So people who are into that side of it, appreciate it. They appreciate it on technicalities. On beat structures and stuff. That’s good in its own context, but when it’s all the time, when there’s nothing else happening apart from that, I think it does need something more human introducing. I blogged about the Daft Punk album when it came out. Because I thought that was a real moment. What they were doing. They were at the point with this EDM thing, hitting a height. They could take their place on the throne and be the kings of EDM, and it was there for them. And instead they rejected it, and they said that music’s lost its direction and what they were looking at doing was bringing back into it musicianship now Rogers, obviously things like that, Pharell Williams, and I think from that, that will influence younger people, younger musicians, to look at music in a slightly different way than maybe people did, certainly dance music, than they did 5 or 10 years ago. I believe that we’re moving more into an emotional aspect at this point in time. Todd Burns We’re out of time. But I’m sure Greg will be happy to answer any questions you might have along the way, either after this or tonight at the club. There will be tickets on the door available if you haven’t already got them. Greg will be playing along with Terri Hooley and Noel Watson. Greg Wilson Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Ashley Beadle. Todd Burns Ashley Beadle as well. So, pretty stellar lineup. Thank you very much for coming today, and enjoy the rest of the weekender. Greg Wilson Thank you.

Ivan Smagghe
Parisian Ivan Smagghe gained his name as a radio DJ and co-founder of the electro duo Black Strobe. He’s parlayed those early days into an idiosyncratic career that includes a residency at Fabric, high-profile remixes as part of the production duo It’s A Fine Line his own label Les Disques De La Mort.
During a 2015 Red Bull Music Academy session in Bristol, Smagghe discussed his label, DJing, record digging, and much more.
Hosted by Emma Warren Are you ready to start? Ivan Smagghe Yeah, yeah. Emma Warren I should actually just paraphrase a little conversation we just had. Ivan Smagghe Oh, here we go. Emma Warren Which was basically if you don’t want to clap at the end of his tunes, don’t clap. Ivan Smagghe No, don’t. Please. You don’t have to. Emma Warren You don’t have to. Ivan Smagghe No. Emma Warren If you disagree with anything he’s saying, feel free to disagree and basically, I think… Ivan Smagghe I’d rather you disagree when I say it than save it for the end. That’s what I meant. Emma Warren We have a license to be a little bit more interactive. Ivan Smagghe Rowdy. Emma Warren I was going to say rowdy. You have license to be a bit more rowdy, should you want to. If you just want to ask questions at the end, like before, that’s completely fine. Ivan Smagghe Yeah. Emma Warren If something comes up while we’re talking and you want to ask them, go ahead. Very big welcome please, Ivan Smagghe. Ivan Smagghe Right. Now you can clap. Yeah. Emma Warren I wanted to start off by asking you about your label, the new one – Les Disques de la Mort. Ivan Smagghe Yeah, Les Disques de la Mort. Emma Warren LDDLM. Ivan Smagghe Yeah, which in English, it doesn’t really work. In French, it means “Death Records,” obviously, but it also means killer record. People always think I’m gloomy. I’m dark. It’s not entirely true. It is true in many ways but not totally true. It also means a killer record. That’s what it means really in French, in slang. Emma Warren I didn’t know that either. I just thought… Ivan Smagghe You’re not going to know everything, huh? Emma Warren Of course not. I would not suggest I do anywhere close. The label is quite different from the other label that you’ve been involved with. Ivan Smagghe Yup. Yup. Emma Warren How many releases through are you now? Three? Ivan Smagghe Four. Five is coming. Five, six. Six at the end of the month. It’s fairly recent. Emma Warren What would be the thing that would make something suitable for this label? Ivan Smagghe It’s a very good question. The answer is nothing. We kind of apply the rule of no rule. I mean, if you have a label, there’s two ways. Either you want to make one style. You want to put yourself in a box, unconsciously or consciously. I try not to put myself in a box, consciously. I may fail. I agree. People may recognize instantly what I want to do but we, because there’s two of us, we’re trying not to do the same things each release or not to stick with one style. I know it’s a bit cliche. The style of no style is now also a style. I don’t know. Emma Warren There’s no escape. Ivan Smagghe No. There’s no escape. You can try not to make what I would call – we might want to come back on that – “functional dance music,” which I’ve got a lot of respect for. It’s a different issue but that might not be what I want to do as a label. Emma Warren What has come out on the label then? Some quite interesting artists? Ivan Smagghe Yeah, I mean they’re not ... The first release which we’ll play in a minute was by two Italian kids called Margot, who’ve got a very interesting story. They used to be, and I like people with interesting stories. That’s also one thing. It’s not only people think it’s only about the music. It’s not really. I like those kids for their music, obviously. I also like them because they used to be commercial DJs in Rimini. I don’t know if any of you have been in Rimini. It’s like playing at Butlins, but in kind of an Italian way. Emma Warren A bit warmer. Ivan Smagghe Yeah, a bit warmer, a bit cooler, a bit flashier. They come from there and then they started getting fed up with that and they ended up with James Holden because they released on Border Community. Then James got too busy and they basically flogged them off to me. That’s how it happened. Emma Warren He passed them on? Ivan Smagghe Yeah well you know, that’s how it happened. I’m telling the truth. It’s interesting to have people like the next release is by the singer of Paranoid London… just random people not necessarily famous and with a talent to be, some people would say weird. I wouldn’t call them weird, but interesting people. The music may be boring to some of you but the people are not. I’m pretty sure about that. Emma Warren Can we hear something about which you are talking? Ivan Smagghe Sure. Yeah that’s the ... I’m going to maybe have to skip through to get to the interesting bit because electronic music sometimes has got really boring intros… (music: Margot – “Waldorf”) Ivan Smagghe I can tell you a little story about this. Does anybody know what language he’s singing? No? Me neither. I think they don’t. I think it’s sang in no language, which is why I actually signed this record. Yeah. I don’t know if it’s half-English, pidgin English, Italian English. No one knows. They won’t tell me. They’re very recluse guys. They fight with each other. There’s two of them. It’s like I don’t know it’s maybe the old schematics of rock & roll bands. They really hate each other. It’s quite funny to watch, actually. Emma Warren How do you tend to communicate with Margot? Ivan Smagghe I don’t. I don’t any more. Oh God, they’re so hard to talk with. That’s also part of the fun. You don’t really sign people because they’re easy to communicate with, you know? You sign people because you fall in love with that song. Actually, we found that song in a James Holden set. We caught it on YouTube. It took me about a year of hassling him because he couldn’t remember. Then it took me another year, in order to get through to them, because they don’t speak English and they don’t want to do this and they don’t want to do that. One of them is a swimmer. The other one’s a punk. It’s just like a nightmare, basically. It’s like that’s what you do if you’ve got a record label. Nightmare is your life, basically. Emma Warren How do they feel now, now they’ve been persuaded into your world, into your realm? Ivan Smagghe I think they’ve left now. I’ve got no clue where they are now. Of course not. That was our first release. Of those artists, I think there’s a few like that, that you can catch for a little moment. It’s like a glimpse into their world. James Holden had the same issue. It’s not actually an issue. That’s why it’s kind of nice that you catch them like that and then, off they go. I’ve got no clue. I know they’re doing things with Prins Thomas. I sometimes hear. I don’t think I’ll ever do anything with them again, but that’s not an issue. A record is a moment. That’s it. Emma Warren You caught the moment. Ivan Smagghe Well I caught this moment. I’m sure they’re going to have many. It’s like going to the dentist and prying a molar. Like to get this was hard work. Emma Warren You started, as you meant to go on. Ivan Smagghe No, no, no. Don’t get me wrong. No. Some other artists are really easy to work with. There’s no rules, you know. You may also, how shall I put that? That’s going to sound really wrong. You shouldn’t take note on that. I sometimes, you can also sometimes put out music that you don’t really like. Yeah… Emma Warren That’s an interesting thought. That’s an interesting thought. Ivan Smagghe Why not? Emma Warren That’s so interesting I forgot to raise my microphone. Why would you put out music that you don’t really like? Ivan Smagghe No, it’s not I don’t really like it. It might fit one of my little boxes. Some people may have one box. I’ve got about 20,000. I get lost in them. Maybe a record I’m going to like more than another one. Then my partner is going to go, “No it’s good.” I’m like, “No, it’s not.” “But some people would like it.” I’m going, “I don’t care. I don’t.” Then I debate in myself. Sometimes, yeah. Some records on the label I like more than others. I’m not going to tell you which ones. But, yeah, why not?
I mean a good record, for me there’s always been that thing. There’s two types of music, good and bad. Sometimes you can like bad music or there’s good music you don’t like. As a label manager, you need also to have that weird shift where you go, “All right. This is not totally maybe 100% me or 100% ideally, but I think it’s good.” It’s a bit schizophrenic. Emma Warren Really, I imagine what you’re saying is that you can have this conversation about whether something is actually good or whether you like it, but the thing always has to be that you find it interesting. Ivan Smagghe Yes. Exactly. That’s exactly that. No and as I’m trying not to pick one genre or one tempo or one style, even though they may be interesting in a different way, in some records I’ll find the attitude interesting more than the production. Like maybe the next one, which will be the next release, I really like the attitude. I was mastering yesterday, and everything was out of phase. I was like, “We can’t do anything with that.” That was probably my favorite release from the beginning and I couldn’t do anything with it. We had to go from scratch. It doesn’t matter because I know the guy. I don’t know if any of you have seen Paranoid London live. It’s the singer. They’re punks. That’s what they are. You deal with it. Not very important. Technicalities. Who cares? You have to care. It’s the other guy who cares, not me. Emma Warren You bring in the punk side? Ivan Smagghe Yeah. I mean yeah. We can actually yeah, it’s called “Sworn Virgin.” A sworn virgin is a very interesting concept. It would take me hours to explain it. You Google it when I’ve finished. This is by the singer of Paranoid London called Mutado Pintado. It will be out by the end of the month. (music: Mutado Pintado – “Sworn Virgins”) Ivan Smagghe As I listen to it, I actually think it’s really weird. I suppose that’s a good thing, right? I can surprise myself. Emma Warren It’s a very good thing. Ivan Smagghe Yeah, I can surprise myself, “Why am I putting them out?” It’s got easier remixes, let’s put it that way. That’s also something you do, that we try and do with this label… I mean every release is different but each release, we try to have different sounding things. For instance, this one we’ll have an Acid Arab remix and Fabrizio Mammarella remix.
We try, with each release, to have, inside the 12”, different worlds. The idea of having four tracks that sound the same doesn’t appeal to me. Once again, when I say it doesn’t appeal to me. I don’t think it’s bad. It’s just not what I’m into. Emma Warren I think one of the things that you do is you expand the edges of where the edges are and make sure that the things that are happening on the margins are as interesting and as varied as possible. Ivan Smagghe Yeah well yeah. There’s a lot in that question. I’m not sure it even was a question. Emma Warren It was more of an observation than a question. Ivan Smagghe Yes. Well, the margins. It’s quite hard to describe. Am I really in the margins? I’m not sure where are the margins now. Let’s put it that way. I try not to go for, as I said before, the functional aspect of dance music, because I think, scrap everything you want – dance music is functional music. Its function is to make people dance. End of the story. Then you can stretch that. You can stretch that. Some people are going to dance on weirder things. Some people won’t. Some people, but not only me. People like Andrew or people like Erol. Emma Warren You’re referring to Andrew Weatherall? Ivan Smagghe Yeah. Exactly. Emma Warren Erol Alkan? Ivan Smagghe We thread in those waters. It’s like the murky waters we call them. It’s like in between. You don’t know. Is it really good? Is it bad? There’s also something I’m very fascinated with, personally – those records, are you sure is it bad or is it really good, or is it really bad borderline records, borderline genres, things that doesn’t fit anywhere… I think for me, these are the interesting records or songs or attitudes. Emma Warren Where does the reissues aspect of the label fit into that aesthetic? Ivan Smagghe Right. This one, the one we put out, it had just gone from friendship because we did put out a 12” reissue of Israeli music. Right. Let’s be a bit controversial there. Israeli music, and especially Israeli coldwave, is probably the last country or genre-plus-country that hasn’t been dug out by English record diggers. I know that for a fact. I don’t know why. I’m not going to get into the… There is a massive Israeli coldwave of culture. I go there quite a lot with a Red Axes guys and they were playing me stuff. I was like, “Wow this is really good” because all the Belgian stuff, all the Italian stuff, all the French stuff, there’s millions of CDs. There’s a lot of things. There, there’s a gap. Why? I’ll let you draw your own conclusions. I don’t really know. I don’t really know. I think there’s fantastic music. We’ve done a 12”. We’re doing a second 12” and we’ll do a CD by the end of the year. Emma Warren What is the music that you’ve discovered, that you’ve dug? Ivan Smagghe Actually, I didn’t. They did. They were just feeding me stuff. I was like, “Hang on a minute.” I knew a couple of the tracks, like the Chromosom track that we might listen. They were just like, “Have a listen to that. This is really, really good.” No one has heard it. No one’s heard it. It still amazes me today that whole scene, apart from Minimal Compact, and a couple of other bands who went on European tours, there’s a whole scene that is strictly Israeli and no one there.
Those records, like the Tova Gertner that is on the 12 was like a top ten hit in Israel. It’s not something that I went in a car boot sale and found a white label. No, no, no, no, no. They’re famous records, famous bands, just a completely… cool. Emma Warren There’s two tracks have already come out. Ivan Smagghe Three. There’s three and then there will be three more in the summer and then we’re probably going to do a CD at the end. It’s just also very complicated because we’re doing the re-issues legally. Some people are cool. I actually met Tova Gertner. She was really cool about it. Some people they don’t. I don’t want to go down the bootleg way. That’s definitely not the way. We can have that conversation. It’s not very interesting. Yeah, that’s very, once again, very, very famous Israeli band. If you go to Israel and you talk to someone who knows about music, well I think they know about Chromosome… (music: Chromosome – “Gazolina (Red Axes Edit)”) Ivan Smagghe Yeah. I think you get the gist of it. Emma Warren I wonder what your thoughts are then on reissues generally? If people are running labels and they’re thinking about reissuing records, what are the kind of things that should make you want to reissue something? What makes a piece of music worthy of being reissued? Ivan Smagghe That it’s not been reissued before is point one. We’re going to put out, I think after the summer, a mixed CD by myself and Nathan Gregory Wilkins, who I did a radio show with. That’s going to be a double mixed CD with no track listing. It will be like the Cycle Magic guys did. That’s another way you can go, the total secrecy. Emma Warren This is already a show you do on NTS? Ivan Smagghe Yeah. Emma Warren Is it every other week? Ivan Smagghe It’s every other week, Tuesday, 6 PM. Yeah. You can also go that way. I mean to be really honest, it depends on what you want to reissue. I mean I work with a distributor called Above Board, who are the main provider of ’90s house at the moment. They have to do things legally but they’re very clever in doing so. All the reissues actually look like the originals. I don’t know if anybody of you have bought a Ron Trent and Chez Damier [inaudible]. It’s not the real thing. It’s a reissue that is made to look like the original. You can go that way. The thing is, it depends what also you’re going to reissue. I’ve got a fairly good chance that the things that me and Nathan are going to do, put on that CD, we won’t get into trouble with because they won’t be big. It’s a mixed CD. It’s only 1,000 copies. Don’t think too much. I mean I did two CDs for Collette of re-edits of rare stuff or even stuff from now. I just gave the guys a call, the guys I knew. They were more than happy to give me the tracks for nothing because I mean two days. There’s so little money involved in that anyway.
There’s small labels like People Like Us… you don’t have to worry too much. I would first think about the idea and the content, then worry about the legalities. It’s not a massive issue. Emma Warren In an era of instant information and instant access to knowing everything, what’s the appeal of the secrecy of a no track listing? Ivan Smagghe A pose, I suppose. Emma Warren Oppose? Ivan Smagghe No, posing. Yeah, posing. I’m joking. No, it’s just well it’s actually to say mainly that even in an era of instant information, there’s still a lot that you don’t know. There’s still a lot I don’t know. There’s still a lot that any digger I know, and I know quite a few, and I know quite a few hard cases, that they don’t know. I mean the extent of records you can find that people don’t know about is… I’m not sure it’s limitless. I mean I know some guys who know just about everything but, once in a while, you can… I know that on this CD there will be a couple of tracks that no one knows or me and Nathan knows or the guy who sold it. There’s a lot of records, a lot, a lot, a lot, and a lot of records that are not on YouTube, a lot of records that are not even on Discogs. That goes back from another era of the way you would buy records. It’s an era of going to dingy warehouses in Canada and talking with really, really boring people over the phone, haggling from £100 to 80 quid for a record. Also, because that’s very important now, if you like old records, like my favorite old records I bought for nothing. Do not think, do not think that the records are worth a lot of money necessarily, and the good ones and the weird ones. That is a lie. That is a lie. I’ve gone on Discogs and I see an MK record or a Kerri Chandler record going for a £100. That’s an absolute… sorry. You find much more interesting records going for one dollar than those. There’s a lot.
I suppose it’s kind of fashion and things like that. You just got to dig. Some people hate it. Some people like it. It’s just easier now because you don’t get ... When I was younger, you used to have what you called digger fingers from doing that. You do that for three hours and you’ve got… It’s dead gone now. Emma Warren Where are your favorite places now to find records? Ivan Smagghe Networks. That’s really boring though. It’s just a network of people, of friends, that would point you towards this. You get a phone call or you get an email, “Oh I found that. Do you want it? Do you want to swap?” It’s really geeky stuff. Then there’s actually the people who sell you the record for quite a lot of money, because I mean I’m not going to lie… I also buy records for, if I’m going to buy a record for £80 from some people, I know they’ve bought it for £4 or £2 because some people, that’s their job. That’s what they do. They get up at 5 AM. The go to car boot sales. I haven’t got time to do that, sadly, any more. What you pay is for them to get up early. That’s fair enough, if the record’s good. That’s fine. I’m happy to stay in bed and pay more money for the record. If the record is good, beware, beware – just don’t go at their place because what they’ll do, you’ll have a nice cup of tea. They’ve got really good hi-fi sound system. I got conned. I got conned many, many times. Yeah, I’ll listen to that. They know perfectly which bit to play. Yeah, the best places is a good record shop, normally a good secondhand record shop is where you can have one deck, even if it’s a shitty deck and you can listen to yourself, not have the guy playing it to you because that, they know all the tricks. I worked ten years in a record shop. I know exactly what you need to play in order for the guy to buy it. Emma Warren You were a record shop guy for a long time. Ivan Smagghe Yeah, I hated that actually, but anyway. Emma Warren You hated it? Ivan Smagghe Yeah, oh God, yeah. Emma Warren I just wondered whether a record shop guy can always tell another record shop guy? Is it like you can always tell someone who’s done their time behind the counter? Ivan Smagghe No. Just like that? No. No, you can, you can if you start talking with them, because it’s the same. It’s always the same bad stories. It’s always the same, “How did you deal with the general public in the ’90s on a comedown Tuesday?” It’s, “Why do you want to hear this? This is shit. I want to play you this. Why don’t you want to buy that? Why do you want this one?” I suppose I would actually not recommend it for music lovers. End of the story. It’s an okay way, if you’re a student and you need to make money, but it’s actually not because when I actually did that, because I didn’t have any money and I was a student and I was playing records. What I ended up doing is actually giving all my wages back to the shop. It’s not a solution. If you want to make money, just do another job, buy the records, but don’t work in a record shop. Actually, it’s not fun. It’s not really fun. Sorry. Emma Warren What about DJing then? Where does that sit on the fun spectrum? Ivan Smagghe That’s not fun either. DJing, no. DJing I think people would know by now that it’s not always fun. It’s not always glamorous and that it’s not always great. Let’s face it, I don’t know of any other job that involves music that pays that well, even in my level, which is not the hyper high level, but two days a week. Let’s put that aside. I’m not going to complain. It is a great job. It is a great job. After that, sometimes it’s great fun on top of being a good wage. Sometimes it’s not. That’s part of the game. It actually took me, there was a moment… it also depends on the music that’s around. You go through phases. Sometimes you don’t like the music that you can buy that is around. You’ve got to ride it. If that’s really what you want to do, you’ve got to ride it. It’s not always great. No. Most of the time, it’s better than working in a bank. There’s exciting places. It also depends, I mean I’m talking after 25 years. I’m not a good example. Twenty-five years of doing that. Twenty-five? Twenty-three. I’m making myself older. It’s very, very exciting in the beginning. If you want to go for it, go for it. I’ve got I think it’s also very different now from when I started. I mean the word career was evoked. When I started, the word career, when I said that to my dad, like that’s going to be my career, basically he didn’t speak to me for ten years. It’s a different thing now. Now, there’s a lot of money. You can go very, very fast. The only advice I would give is… there’s only one I ever give, it’s that if you really want to do that, just stick to your guns because if you don’t, you might make a lot of money very quickly and then you might fade away. It depends. That is maybe what you want to do. I’m not going to give names, but there’s a very good story about people who the majority of people think that’s always what they wanted to do. They always wanted to do that. Then they made money. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. They’ve always wanted to make the money and that was their way. Yeah. It’s not an easy job. It’s not an easy job. It’s a cool job. I like it. I still like it now. Emma Warren Can you tell us about a couple of things you’ve done recently, a couple of interesting gigs? A couple of things that come to my mind, but tell me maybe a couple of things that you’ve done or shall I ask you about the ones that I’ve got in my mind? Ivan Smagghe Yeah, please. That would be quicker. Emma Warren It might be quicker. Ivan Smagghe Otherwise, I’m going to have to think quite hard. Emma Warren The two things I was thinking about was you played at the last night of a very famous Amsterdam club called Trouw. Ivan Smagghe Oh, yeah, right. Emma Warren Then not so long after that, you played a Bugged Out set, which was a thing Bugged Out do where they ask people to bring their five favorite records. Ivan Smagghe Right. Yes. Emma Warren Kind of high fidelity thing you might do at your friend’s house versus a classic, dirty Amsterdam warehouse. Ivan Smagghe Right. Trouw, that’s a very good example of that actually. That’s what I will always say. It doesn’t really depend on you. It doesn’t really depend on the mood. It doesn’t depend on the city. When I hear Berlin is great, I’m sorry, that’s rubbish. Berlin is not great. There’s great clubs in Berlin. There’s great clubs anywhere. It’s all about the club where you play. Trouw is a very good example. I actually didn’t play the last one. We all did our last one, because they had four months of ending. Emma Warren That’s a long good bye. Ivan Smagghe It was a long good bye for them because it was becoming everybody’s favorite club. Yeah, it’s all about the club, basically. There are clubs where you kind of know it’s going to be good. Robert Johnson played for years, was for me the best club in the world. People beg to differ. I don’t like Panorama Bar, well that’s my idea. It’s all about the club, not the city, not the thing. With the Bugged Out thing, that was like a wedding. That was pretty weird, that thing. Emma Warren So, paint the picture. I’m sure I wasn’t there. Maybe you guys were there because you’re here in Bristol but paint the picture. What was happening? Ivan Smagghe You know where a wedding where there’s everything clashes and mixes. Basically, there’s like 40 DJ’s who had to pick out five records… five of their favorite records. That was like that for five hours, which was kind of an interesting car crash, I thought. Yeah, no, it was actually the best moment of that is that Jackmaster playing happy hardcore, which I thought was at least quite ballsy, because after a while, you got literally fed up with things being…Even me, I thought, “That was a bit boring.” No, but it was an interesting thing. I actually thought before getting there that it was going to be way worse. The place was great. It was actually, I don’t know, it was a bit of a reunion you know. It was like an old people’s home. It’s there 25 years. Emma Warren I’m not sure if you heard that. He just said it was like an old people’s home. You did kind of mumble that. Ivan Smagghe Yeah well… Emma Warren That’s funny. Ivan Smagghe I just don’t want… I’m going to get quoted on that. They know. That was the whole point. It was there 25 years. Everybody who played there had to pick out five records. I thought it was quite fun, interesting, yeah. Emma Warren I guess fairly soon we’ll put it out to questions, to you guys. Again, feel free to ask whatever comes to mine. Ivan Smagghe Yeah, anything. Emma Warren Anything. I wondered maybe if there’s something else that we could hear, whether it’s a remix you’ve done recently or something else that’s going to be coming out or something else that we can hear of you? Ivan Smagghe I mean there’s an It’s A Fine Line album which is a project I’ve got with Tim Paris that I’ve been working on now for far too many years. We did loads of things, he and I, but I did other things. It was an ongoing affair. We’ve got a studio together. The album is ready. Sadly, you can’t hear it because we don’t want to leak it now. I’ll play something we did a couple of years back. It was just to say that don’t think ever that it’s quick. I mean it can be. Sometimes it is. You can make a great record in one day. Sometimes you can make a record I don’t even know if it’s great and it’s going to take you 10 years. It doesn’t really matter. It also doesn’t really matter what the record sounds like, as long as you like it. I mean ultimately it comes down to this: Do you like it? Are you trying to please people? I mean if you do that, you might as well work in advertising. That’s a different job.
You need to like your records. They might be a bit shit. They might be a bit weird. You might not even be sure other people will like it. I would say that if you like, it and I’m really the worst critic. That’s quite often the case with artists, they’re the worst. Most of the time, I don’t even play my own records. We’re very hard on ourselves, at least I am, and I know quite a few others that are. The most important thing, if you like it, it’s good. The rest, it doesn’t really count. I think in all sincerity, if you like it and if it goes to a record, I think people will hear it. Maybe I’m a bit optimistic on that. The same with DJing. You know? If you’re a bit sincere, it helps. Emma Warren What are we going to hear? Ivan Smagghe There’s a track that was, it was released on Kompakt. It’s kind of representative of where we’re at or where we were at, at that point, which is how to make a dance record that is not a dance record or the other way around. I don’t know how to explain that. I don’t know. You tell me. Emma Warren Dance not dance I think is the phrase. (music: It’s A Fine Line – “Eins Fine Grind”) Ivan Smagghe This might sound really bizarre as a record but actually it was like the one we sold the most. It got catwalk. You never know. You never know. Just stick to what you want to do… Emma Warren You’re saying it’s a fine line album that will be coming out towards the end… Ivan Smagghe September. Emma Warren In September is kind of in the realm, not like this but in the realm of the same space? Ivan Smagghe It’s in the realm of no realm. I don’t even know anymore. It’s been too long now. It’s not a straight house record. At the same time, I’ve never made a straight house record. Well, I did one in ’96… Emma Warren Actually, that would be the most shocking thing you could possibly do. Ivan Smagghe I actually did one in ’96, which is that’s quite a funny story that. It was a big hit at DC 10 two years ago. I did that in ’96, which actually kind of made me really sad. Emma Warren What was this record and why did it make you sad? Ivan Smagghe I’m not telling you that. No, it’s just really bizarre. It was actually the first record I ever made. It was only for one year. It was not in a big hit but it was played on a regular basis and people would sit down on DC 10 on that really bad house record I made in ’96. See, there you go. Emma Warren I see you’re covering even the most straightforward on a strange basis. Ivan Smagghe As long as you didn’t try, that’s all right. Emma Warren Do we have any questions? Is there anything you would like to learn? Where’s the spare microphone? It’s coming up the stairs. So, we’ve got a question at the back. Audience member Hi. Apart from Andrew and Erol, who you mentioned, who is your favorite DJ? Ivan Smagghe Oh God. Am I going to have to give names? My favorite DJ. Dead or alive? Audience member Either. Ivan Smagghe Either. Oh. Well I’ll just keep on the dead because there’s too many. I’d say if you want a good quality for money, I’ll go for the not famous one. I think probably my favorite DJ that people wouldn’t think of is Mark Marc Piñol
who used to be the resident in Nitsa in Barcelona, who works with John Talabot. It’s a bit like a horse race, a 20 to 1 kind of guy. Really, really good though. You can get him for quite cheap at the moment, but I don’t think it will last. Emma Warren Your very own racing tip, there. Ivan Smagghe There you go. Emma Warren Thrown in for free. Ivan Smagghe There’s too many. Also, as I always say, it’s a very hard question to answer that because there’s different DJ’s for different times, moods, eras of my life as well. I mean the guys from the Boccacio when I used to go out there when I was really young, they were incredible for me at the time. I try to listen to tapes now and it’s fairly horrible. There you go. Don’t idolize this or that. Also, there’s always a bad day and a good day for DJs. Funnily enough, it’s not always, it doesn’t always relate.
Sometimes people say, “Wow I loved your set.” I think, “I actually hated it.” Sometimes it’s the other way around. Don’t idolize. I mean there’s a lot of good DJs around. A lot, a lot. More and more actually. I’m not part of the pessimist camp. I think there’s a lot, a lot of good DJs, and a lot of good music around. Emma Warren You just got to find it I guess. Ivan Smagghe Exactly. Emma Warren Who else has a question? audience member Hi. I just wondered if you had a word for Andrew Weatherall who I’ve always kind of been… Ivan Smagghe Again!? audience member Yeah, yeah, again. It’s quite a treat for you but between your relationship, I’ve always seen you guys or him as almost like a kindred spirit. Ivan Smagghe Yup. audience member As far as you’re concerned. Ivan Smagghe Yup. audience member I just wondered how you guys met and the genesis of your relationship really because I have no idea. Ivan Smagghe That’s actually a very good question because it’s not often actually that I talk about it. It’s, weirdly, it’s probably because of the, because of me moving to London. It became a known fact. I actually met Andrew fairly recently, probably about 10 years ago. I don’t come from dance music. In France, it’s a bit different than here. In France, if you’re into music or underground music, and especially dance music, 90% of the people from my age that came from black music, soul, funk, disco, hip-hop, I came from indie. I’m a coldwave guy basically. Andrew was important in the late ’80s and early ’90s because he bridged the gap for me. I didn’t know him. I mean I remember seeing him. He won’t like it if I say that but the first time I actually met him, you all remember that he had long, blond curly hair and white vest and leather black trousers. There we go. We only met formally and he only became a friend fairly recently. Yeah. He’s a very important guy for me, to make me understand something that I had grasped but not formulated – that indie, rock and dance and things, it didn’t matter, because in France it does matter. You’re either into rock or you’re into funk and soul. In England, it didn’t. I mean he’s not the only one. Happy Mondays or even Stone Roses or things like that, things that may sound a bit nasty, were really, really important at the time. Emma Warren Thank you. We’ve got time for another couple of questions, if anyone has anything to ask, or are you just scared? Ivan Smagghe No. They shouldn’t be scared. Emma Warren Don’t be scared. If there’s nothing else anyone wants to ask, obviously you can come and ask afterwards. Ivan Smagghe Privately. Yeah, private questions. Yeah, sure. Emma Warren Come and have a chat. In which case, we should just say a very big thank you… Ivan Smagghe No worries. Pleasure. Thank you.

Title: Francesco Tristano

Francesco Tristano
Classically trained but equally inspired by electronic music, Francesco Tristano is on a journey that’s rendering the distinction between the two all but irrelevant. As a pianist who regards his instrument as a piece of percussion, it’s not surprising that his head was turned by the New York nightlife while studying at the prestigious Juilliard School.
In 2011 Red Bull Music Academy lecture he goes in depth about his transition and why he sees no difference between the two forms, how he came to work with Carl Craig and Moritz von Oswald and why no recording of any track is ever definitive, just one version among many.
Hosted by Todd L. Burns I was stressing out last night, brushing up on all my classical music
knowledge. I wrote to you at 2:45 AM and said should we play some of this
composer, who I looked up in Wikipedia, or that composer. Then I thought to
myself, ”There’s so many versions of all these songs,” but then you wrote back
within five minutes saying, “Yeah, we should play these people, but I could
play them.” Why don’t we begin with you playing something on the Wurlitzer, something
old school, so to speak, that maybe sounds a bit new in your mind? Francesco Tristano The Wurlitzer is missing a C3 and it’s out of tune, but I think it’s going to be okay. Todd L. Burns By the way, please welcome Francesco Tristano. (applause) (music: Francesco Tristano plays Orlando Gibbons / applause) Todd L. Burns Who was that? Francesco Tristano It was a piece by Orlando Gibbons, English composer, mid-17th century. Todd L. Burns He was before Bach? Francesco Tristano Definitely, about a century before Bach. Todd L. Burns What’s special about him in your mind? You have him on your bio, I think, or
it’s mentioned on your website as being a particular influence on you. Francesco Tristano I love the harmonies. We tend to think of old music as being something different from new music, which it is by the standards of time, but by the standards of harmony and rhythm it’s not necessarily so. I think this sounds
like Plaid more than it sounds
like Bach, for the most part. It’s modal, it’s not following a tonal system,
it’s following a modal system and Plaid are using modes as well. It’s just that harmonic language that was always interesting to me from an early age on,
I just always loved old music. The problem is there was no piano at the time.
This wasn’t written for piano because there was no piano at the time. It was
certainly not written for a Wurlitzer. Todd L. Burns You make quite a point about things not being written for the piano. One of your first albums, your first electronic, so to speak, albums, called Not For Piano; a lot of pieces not for piano. Seems like a very important idea of taking things and putting them in the context of a different instrument and seeing what can
happen. Francesco Tristano Yes, it’s a very good point. The piano, this is a beautiful instrument. It’s
huge, the design is so impressive and big, but the image we have of the piano
is the image of 19th-century music, maybe some high-scale salon, Parisian
style and maybe some wigs. I think that’s the wrong image. When the piano appeared about 1750, a little before 1740, it was such a crazy instrument that most composers didn’t want to use it. “Too big, it’s too crazy, I can’t do
anything.” Bach didn’t like it, he probably saw an early prototype that wasn’t
very good and he was, “That’s not for me.” I tend to like music that’s very
old-time, before the piano even existed, and very contemporary music where the
piano is no longer valid as an instrument, like techno, for example. So it’s this extreme
repertoire of playing the very old stuff and then trying to do something new,
but always with the idea that the piano is an instrument of the future, it’s
always been. It became in one century the most used instrument by composers.
While Bach didn’t want to touch it, not interested, about a century later
every hotshot composer was a pianist and was using the piano as the main
source of expression. Todd L. Burns But obviously, now that all these hotshot composers have used it there’s a lot
of baggage that’s been put upon the piano, especially within popular culture.
When you come to it, you hear it as this romantic, quaint, wig-wearing salon
thing. I read an interview with you once where you said you see the piano as a percussion instrument and I think that’s a big break in terms of your thinking. I wonder at what point you had that epiphany, that the piano is not
this romantic quaint thing; we can do all sorts of things. Was it very early
on? Was it an immediate thing? Francesco Tristano I wanted to be a drummer, but I happened to have a piano at home, which was
probably a strategic move by my mom. But I wanted to play the drums, so I
suppose my first steps at the piano were trying to imitate the drums, sort of
playing clusters in the low register. There are pictures of me walking with my feet
on the keyboard. Eventually, I got a drum set and as soon as I was done with
the practising I went to the basement and played the drums for the whole
afternoon. Todd L. Burns Your mum made you put it in the basement? Francesco Tristano Yeah. She didn’t get the drum set for me, though; it was my uncle. Todd L. Burns The cool uncle. Francesco Tristano Yes. But the piano is definitely a percussion instrument by the mechanics of
the instrument. This is the same mechanics actually (points to Wurlitzer),
but we don’t see it. When you press the key there’s a whole mechanism where,
in the end, a whole bunch of back and forth, there’s a hammer hitting on a
string. We cannot really control that, it’s like the attack and the decay of
the piano is not changeable, it’s always going to be the same. There are a few keyboard instruments which emulate vibrato playing, sort of like the
clavichord, which I believe was Bach’s favourite keyboard instrument, where
you have an after touch. Like a nice synthesizer, you can press the key and
whatever you do with the finger, later you can hear it. The piano doesn’t react so it’s kind of a stupid instrument in terms of attack, because it’s percussion based. But the cool thing about the piano is you can create the illusion of many instruments. You can create the illusion of a string
instrument, you can create the illusion of a wind instrument, and of course,
you have the very instrumental keyboard sound, which you can bring out. This leads me to believe that, in fact it’s a synthesizer, you know? I was studying
classical music, I suppose, but in a non-classical city – New York is classic,
but it’s not necessarily classical – and I realized this could be some kind of
synthesizer. Especially, when I started going inside the piano and fiddling
around with the overtones, which is basically the resonance of a filter.
Depending on how much you press the string, you have an effect, which is like
cut-off. Then you have the pedal, which is like the release or the sustain. So
it really is some sort of ancestral synthesizer. Todd L. Burns Even though you said you haven’t had a normal classical upbringing to an
outsider’s view, you went to Juilliard, you did all the practising, you have
all these classical CDs out. Were your parents the typical taskmasters, you’re
practicing two, three, four hours a day when you were growing up? Were they
cracking the whip, so to speak, or was it something you immediately took to? Francesco Tristano I wasn’t forced to do anything, I just enjoyed it very much. It took me a while to realize I wanted to do that, but around 12 or 13 I knew I was going to use the piano in some way, I wasn’t sure exactly how. I guess what confused my mother is that I always wanted to do something else. I was studying classical music but in my free hours I was improvising jazz and just trying to digest the real book, the chord changes and the choruses and stuff. And then I went to New York and I got into electronic music and I was, “That’s what I want to do now. That’s what I want to explore and try to understand.” By then jazz had already faded, I had a few jazz projects going but I dropped these
and then I got into turntables and mixing boards and gear. I really dipped into it, but always with the idea of combining it with the piano sound because I thought the piano sound could still be evolving. That’s something else about the very basic design of the piano – it’s a design that’s been evolving for 200 years. We think it’s always been the same for 200 years, but it’s not. In fact, I was in Japan this summer with Yamaha and I went out to see a Yamaha
factory. The technology used to fabricate a piano is just unbelievable.
There’s new models, new prototypes, coming out every year, new technology, new
mechanical instruments, new pedals; it’s a constant evolution. Todd L. Burns I remember you saying when you were recording your last album in Detroit that
you found a piano you liked very much and you had to wait many months for it
to become available for you to record the album. So every piano, like every
guitar, every whatever, sounds a little bit different. Francesco Tristano A lot different, I think. The thing is it’s so big we can’t travel with our
instruments; only a very lucky few can do that. It’s half a ton, to put that
on a plane is complicated. In Detroit there was one instrument I thought could
be great for my album. Then I had to wait a year until it was available, or
until I was available at the same time as the piano. We brought it into Carl [Craig]’s
studio and Planet E became the piano auditorium for a week. I was so happy that I could get that piano, that was basically the
foremost inspiration for the album, the sound of that piano. Todd L. Burns How was it different to other pianos that you saw in Detroit? What was it? Francesco Tristano I can become very geeky about pianos. Todd L. Burns Let’s do it. Francesco Tristano OK. Fundamentally, Steinway is an
important brand. It has two factories – one in Hamburg, one in New York – and
the markets are strictly divided so you won’t find a Hamburg Steinway in the
US. Maybe a few, but it’s not current. The New York Steinway has a different
design, you can recognize it. It’s edgier by the keyboard, the Hamburg is
rounded off. It’s different in the bass register. I find the New York
Steinways to be much more slamming in the bass and for my music it’s what I
need. Like I said, a percussion instrument, I need the bass register to be... Todd L. Burns If you’re going to record at Planet E you’re going to need that. Francesco Tristano Definitely because you have to fight against all the instruments in the studio, all the synthesizers, all the effects boxes. A good piano, you know right away. You play one chord and you’re like yeah or no. Sometimes you’re
stuck with a bad piano and you have to go with it, but not if you’re going to
record your album. Todd L. Burns Why were you in New York? How did you get there? For the first time, when you
were talking about discovering techno earlier. Francesco Tristano I visited New York when I was a teenager, I was staying at a friend’s
apartment with my mom on the Upper West side. We were walking around, I was
playing piano, concertos at the time, and we walked by the Juilliard School
and I said, “This could be a cool place to hang out and study.” Three years
later I was accepted. The term conservatory, you want to conserve something, I suppose, conserve tradition, the luggage, you called it. There are also the
times after the conservatory, which is New York City. I did my studies
decently, practiced a lot, but then there was always the other part... Todd L. Burns You were a good student? Francesco Tristano Yes, I was, I suppose I was. But for me, the main thing about being in a
conservatory is to try to be exactly the opposite of a conservative person. In
that sense Juilliard is great. Basically, there is one exam to get in and
one exam to get out. Once you’re in you do what you want. There’s a great
music lab, for example. Todd L. Burns It seems interesting that there’s one exam to get in, one exam to get out, but
it’s still so conservative. You can do whatever you want, but everyone’s not
really taking advantage, would you say? Francesco Tristano Everybody is a relative term. I found some great people at Juilliard, I met my
piano partner Rami Khalifé. We teamed up for
the project Aufgang and he’s kind of my alter ego, we connect on many levels. We basically spend our afternoons improvising. Once we’re done with the classes, we were listening to a lot of techno at the time and then we’d just go into a practice room and improvise for hours, but constant BPM sort of
thing. Some people walk by and go, “What’s happening here?” - and walk out
again. It doesn’t matter how conservative people are, it really doesn’t matter, because you’ll find conservative people anywhere, you’ll find them in jazz, you’ll find them in electronic music, you’ll find them in classical
music. For me, it was about trying to take in everything that New York City
had to give, not just in electronic music – in fact, electronic music is kind
of limited right now in New York City. Maybe it was a little better 10 years
ago. Todd L. Burns When did you arrive? Francesco Tristano ’98 to 2003 were my years. Todd L. Burns So right around the time that Giuliani was coming in, which was the tail end
of a really powerful moment in club culture in New York. Francesco Tristano A sad moment, I suppose, in club culture because many bars and clubs had their
license revoked. So you couldn’t dance even though there was a DJ. I remember
in the East Village, a few nights out, pumping music, great vibes, then you
start moving and it’s, “No, no, you can’t dance. You can’t dance.” So that was
interesting that you put such a censorship on people, but also giving them the
music. Todd L. Burns But there were places you could dance. Where were the places that meant the
most to you? Francesco Tristano A place called Vinyl, Danny Tenaglia, BeYourself. We never met, but I learned so much from his sets, that would go for ten, 12
hours. Vinyl didn’t have an alcohol licence, there was no alcohol, which as a
European in New York seemed completely extravagant. I probably was underage
anyway. But it was about listening to the sets and then trying to figure out what tunes they were. I realized Detroit techno was very prominent, trying to get the CDs, the LPs. I wasn’t a student at Red Bull Music Academy, I didn’t know how to do it so I had to do it on my own. Todd L. Burns Danny Tenaglia around that time was probably one of your best teachers. Ten, 12-hour sets, he’d be one of your best teachers because he had the time to play just about anything throughout the set. Disco, house, techno, all over the place. I imagine it was hard to figure some of it out. Were there people you
were going out with, or were you going up to the DJ booth to ask him? What was
the process? You said you didn’t have a Red Bull Music Academy. Francesco Tristano I wish I did, I wish I was a student here, guys. Really. Sometimes I’d go out
with Rami or with some friends, sometimes I’d go out and just listen, not even
dance, just listen, try to understand the grooves. Listen in a new way,
because the way I think of music – and I still fight against this, in a good
sense, not a bad sense – I still separate the elements of harmony, rhythm,
melody, bass – basically layers of musical elements, whereas in electronic
music this is all very relative. It’s about sounds more than the notes, I guess. Todd L. Burns Is that some of what was immediately appealing to you? That you kind of
couldn’t tell, it was all jumbled together what was melody and what was the
harmony, it switched. Francesco Tristano Definitely, because in a good techno track you can have harmony, which
basically functions as a rhythmic impulse thing, and it doesn’t matter what
harmony it is. I hear it and it could be something else and it still fulfills
its purpose, which is to give a rhythmic pulse to the track. I was always attracted to things that were on the opposite end of my spectrum. So I had to
get my way into it. But then, of course, people like John Cage already predicted this in the ‘30s, that music would no longer be notes and layers of bass and harmony and
melody, but it would be just sounds. Composers would be sound artists, he called them. This was from a lecture in 1938. John Cage was probably about 50 years ahead in the way we try to approach music. Todd L. Burns Why don’t we play a track, one of your renditions of an electronic track?
Three points to anyone who recognizes this. This is off Not For Piano. (music: Francesco Tristano – “Andover” / applause) That was Autechre, “Andover.” Tell me
some of the other things you chose to rearrange, replay. I guess the first
question would be what would you say that you did? Cover? Francesco Tristano You said rendition. Extraordinary rendition (laughs). Todd L. Burns Most of them were Detroit techno tracks and that one was not. Francesco Tristano But not unrelated. I chose these classics... Todd L. Burns Jeff Mills, “The Bells”, Derrick May, “Strings Of Life.” Francesco Tristano It was basically to indicate what the album could be about. It was a piano
album, after all. It was the first time I published my pieces, but by
including a few techno classics and one IDM classic, I suppose, I just wanted
to hint at the direction of where the album is targeted. I wasn’t trying to do
a recollection of classics, I just included these pieces to say this is about
electronic music, even though I’m playing the piano. If you put “The Bells” on
then there’s no doubt about it in a way. I did a few versions of Carl Craig’s
music. I played “Technology” a
lot; I played “Technology” at Carnegie Hall,
which was nice because I think that was the first time Carl’s music was
performed at Carnegie Hall. In the same program I played Frescobaldi, which I
played yesterday night, a piece from 1607, and that was also the first time it
was performed at Carnegie Hall. So you see how sometimes the extremes meet up
in very concrete situations like that. How institutions target the programming
for just one repertoire and leave the extremes out completely. Todd L. Burns How did you get to the point in your classical career – you had a number of
things out on various classical labels, I saw – where you just say, “I’m just
going to add “The Bells” tonight”? Francesco Tristano As pure provocation, perhaps. Todd L. Burns And who’s letting you do that, as well? You set the agenda and say, “I’m going
to play Frescobaldi,” and then the last minute you improvise and play “The
Bells.” Francesco Tristano Usually, I do it the other way around. My teacher said, “Tell your best jokes
first.” I think my best jokes are my own stuff or the more electronically driven stuff, so I start with that and then finish with Frescobaldi. I think that’s a really nice way to discover old music in a new context. Like I didyesterday, the Frescobaldi sort of came out of my piece, “Hello.” There’s nobody who monitors this, nobody tells me what to do. The stage is a place of freedom and I like it to be complete artistic freedom. It’s not a place to be afraid of –
quite the contrary, it’s a space to go as far out as you can. The problem is with promoters, sometimes classical promoters have very strict ideas of what they want and sometimes you have to negotiate. You meet them halfway but you
also want to do your own stuff. But I always have great experiences with
classical audiences hearing, for example, “Strings Of Life” or Carl Craig’s
“Technology,” I think the audience can never be underestimated. I’m not sure about promoters, but you can’t put a listing of what audience is best.
Sometimes I’m so surprised by elderly people who come up to me after the show
and say, “What was this piece where you play inside the piano?” “Strings Of
Life.” “Does the composer know you played inside the piano?” “The composer
probably doesn’t even know I played this piece.” She was very shocked by that,
the lady. She said, “How does it work, how do you get the score?” “There’s no
score.” “Well, how do you do it?” “I listen and I try to do a version.” I like the term ‘version’ very much, more than ‘rendition,’ maybe. Everything is a
version, even the original “Strings Of Life” is just a version. There are
several original versions, then there is Derrick May’s original idea, which we
cannot capture because it isn’t captured in sound, it’s not captured on a
score. So the original “Strings Of Life” is a version, and it goes in circles,
a version of a version of a version. I think that’s exactly what the old
composers like Bach and Vivaldi and Frescobaldi did. They were great remixers of their times. Bach was a great remixer, he heard a theme he liked by some Italian composers, picked it up and used it in his own
music, didn’t even credit the original composer and just said, “This is my
concerto.” And it’s basically a remix. That’s one more analogy between the Baroque age and our times, which is definitely the age of the remix. Todd L. Burns Was “Strings Of Life” the first one that you decided to do on the piano? Francesco Tristano I suppose so. Todd L. Burns What was it about that track that said to you, “I can do this” or “I have a
way in, this is the one”? Francesco Tristano For one thing I’m sorry I missed the whole techno thing that was happening
late ‘80s, early ‘90s, I was too young. I got into it early 2000s, which was
OK, but the classics had already gone – not gone, but they’d passed. So when I
heard “Strings Of Life,” I remembered it but I didn’t know from where. ‘I know
this tune, but what is it?’ I don’t know how I discovered the title even. I think I went to one of Carl’s DJ sets and he played it, the melody was stuck
in my mind. Then I did some research and I remember I found this internet site
with cellphone rings and one of them was “Strings Of Life.” “Oh, so this is
it, ‘Strings Of Life.’” Todd L. Burns Did you use it as your ringtone? Francesco Tristano No, I didn’t, I never downloaded a ringtone from any site. But I liked the
harmonies of that piece. When the harmonies are appealing I want to do something with it. It’s the same with the Gibbons. Todd L. Burns You’re a harmony guy. Francesco Tristano (laughs) I’m a harmony guy. No, I guess I’m more of a percussive guy,
actually. When the harmony is surprising and the second chord of “Strings Of
Life” is really surprising. I don’t know if this is still on. (plays “Strings Of Life” on Wurlitzer) The transformation between the two chords is a world apart but in a very short
time span, and I suppose that’s what made me want to use it. Todd L. Burns I don’t know Derrick’s background as well as I should, but it seems like the
chord change of a non-composer would make. “Oh this sounds kind of nice.” And
someone who’s classically trained would never think to make that connection,
perhaps. Francesco Tristano Maybe. Todd L. Burns When you played “Strings Of Life” did you immediately go into the piano at the
end? Or was that something that came about over time when you felt like you
had a handle on the piece? Francesco Tristano I did play inside the piano already before I did “Strings Of Life,” it just
seemed like a cool ending to the version. Unfortunately, for the vinyl release
we ran out of room so we had to cut this part. So I suppose, when I play live
now it’s my revenge, I make that part especially long because I just love to
play. I had so much gear in the piano yesterday I couldn’t really reach into the piano the way I’m used to. When it’s clear you have such a range of sounds, all the metal and the wood, I wasn’t even getting there because I had
the computer and all the MIDI controllers. But it’s not on the vinyl, that
part is not on the original release. Todd L. Burns The label you release for, Infiné, it’s a
French label and it seems like one of few labels in the electronic world that
would be open to something like this. How did you get hooked up with them? Who
was the person you talked to at the label, what was the driving force behind
you going down this road? Francesco Tristano It was one show in Paris, I think 2005, a show where I played a mixed program
with some very old music, some Bach. I think I finished the program with “Strings
Of Life” and after the show this guy, Alexandre Cazac, came up to me and he
said, “Your “Strings Of Life” is great. I’ve been wanting to set up a label
for some time and now is the time to do it.” So he introduced me to his team,
to Agoria, and I recorded the
first version of “Strings Of Life” pretty soon after that. Then the version on
my album was recorded a bit later, better piano, better settings in general. Todd L. Burns On the “Andover” thing we listened to you can hear some electronic stuff going
on in the background, all over the album in places. When did that come into
play, when did you start playing with software or other instruments, to bring
that into the fold? Francesco Tristano A while ago I was always trying to expand the sound of the piano with keyboards. I loved people like Joe Zawinul, for example, watching these videos from the ‘70s... Todd L. Burns He’s the keyboardist with Weather Report. Francesco Tristano Yes, but he was actually a classical keyboardist, then he was a bebop pianist
with Cannonball Adderley and then he met Miles and then he went his way. But
he never played with less than six keyboards or synthesizers and then there
were these pieces of furniture behind him, basically like furniture of sound.
A synthesizer in ‘72 was not just a keyboard: you had to bring the rack and
the rack was two meters high or something and I thought that was fascinating,
how you can switch sounds so easily and try to build your own language with
the way you combine the different sounds. At Juilliard there was a great music
lab with some amazing old gear. I completely fell in love with the Yamaha
DX7, which is very basic, version
1, and I started using that to make my own tracks while I was a student. The
idea to go beyond the piano... but it’s composition, production, the same thing,
whether you sit down at a table and write the music on paper or you’re at the
computer and you program it, I think there’s no difference. The difference is for me when I try to arrange it to perform it live and still play the piano in an attractive way for me, not just loop stuff. I love to play loops, I have no
issue playing the same thing over and over, as you might have noticed yesterday. But if you loop something real time, which is you play the same thing over and over, it’s so alive, much more than if I just press record,
then play and loop it. So on Not For Piano there’s a whole bunch of piano loops, but they’re all played out. The Autechre tune was edited down to about
six minutes, but it could be I play it for 20 minutes. Basically always the
same thing, then look for the good parts and cut them, edit it together. Todd L. Burns It must be hard to play loops over and over, but you say you find that quite easy. Francesco Tristano It’s not about easy or hard, it’s just me, I love to play loops, I have no issue with it. Some people in Aufgang, for example, my band, Rami is like, “You play the loops, I’ll play the free stuff.” I have no issue with playing the same bassline. That’s the thing, if you program something you can record a one-bar
thing and then loop it and it’s going to be static, or you can actually
record, even MIDI, you can record the bassline, but record the whole track,
record it live, and if it’s a six-minute track you’ll play for six minutes.
That’s how I do most of my tracks, I play as much live as I can, I loop as
little as I can, rhythmic programming is a different thing because you also
need the quantize to be right. But basslines are so much groovier when they’re off, I think. They’re so much more appealing when they’re not always falling
on the same spot within the bar. If they move a little bit – we’re not machines, I think we’re not machines yet - but when I play the bassline, even though it’s the same thing, it’s going to move in time. I think it can only be beneficial for the track to do longer loops or to play them out live. Todd L. Burns Let’s play a track from Aufgang. You mentioned them a couple of times already. “Channel 7”? Francesco Tristano How about “Sonar”? (music: Aufgang – “Sonar”) Todd L. Burns ...all fine record stores. That
was “Sonar.” (applause) That’s where Aufgang first played, correct? Francesco Tristano Correct. Todd L. Burns So that was based off the memory of the first performance? Francesco Tristano We actually wrote it for the first performance, one of our first pieces, 2005. Todd L. Burns Tell me about the freedom of having a drummer finally. Francesco Tristano It’s great. The first version of Aufgang we didn’t have a drum set – it was
two pianos and electronics and that was it. After a year, Aymeric, the guy who was
doing most of the programming, was, “Guys, I want to use the drums.” He’s a
great drummer, he’s played with Cassius, a whole bunch of rap artists in France and
Phoenix, he’s also the drummer for Phoenix. As soon as we used the drum set... the first date was in Holland about four years ago, the energy was doubled onstage. It’s really the
drums that hold the thing together because we play without a click always, we just don’t like playing with a click. But we do have live MIDI stuff going on onstage, so Aymeric, the drummer, he’s on click, so we just follow him and he’s holding it together. So it’s really just freedom to have a drum set onstage, it really is. Todd L. Burns How did this start? You obviously wanted to do a project with Rami, you’re
friends from school, but what was the guiding principle behind the whole
thing? Francesco Tristano I guess it took us a while to figure that out. The first album came together
after three or four years of playing together, composing, trying to find our
sound. Then we added the drums and it was a whole different thing after a
while. Todd L. Burns I guess that was the moment when you realized “we have something really.” Francesco Tristano Yeah, but the compositions, the tunes, we were trying to make them so we would
be free. It was a live project first of all, the album took a while to come
together. The drum was one large leap in our sound, but most of the work we do
behind doors at the computer. We send each other files, Aymeric sends new
basslines, Rami and I compose the piano stuff on top. Then we record and send
it back and maybe get together. It’s complicated because we live in three
different countries so we don’t see each other so often, so it’s always a very
intense way of working. Now we have a space in Paris where we meet
occasionally and we just recorded our second album, so we’re working on that.
I think it’s different in the sense that this is really produced. The piano is
played live, the drums are played live, but all the rest is pretty much laid
out in the studio and, you know MIDI. I think the new album will be much more of a live feel. You’ll hear a few moments where it sounds more rocky, but that could be the
sound of the drums in general. As soon as a drummer gets out of himself...
because Aymeric, he’s like a machine, but he can also be like a rock drummer. Todd L. Burns Do you have to tell him to settle down sometimes? Francesco Tristano Yeah, we do. Todd L. Burns Is it hard being in a band for you, coming from this classical background? How
do you negotiate that? Francesco Tristano It’s a relief, a relief. When we’re together there’s this vibe that anything
could happen and we’re invincible. Whereas when you’re alone on tour, you
always have different projects, but you’re alone, travelling alone, preparing
alone, concentrating alone. To prepare with your brothers is a relief. We have
a good vibe. We had a small tour about a month ago and nothing could go wrong. Todd L. Burns You do a lot of collaboration anyway. You’ve worked with Carl Craig, you’ve
worked with Moritz von Oswald, sometimes together. Let’s talk about Carl first.
You went to see him DJ and met him afterwards, you said hello. I think Infiné
had introduced you two. Correct? Francesco Tristano Yes, Alexandre, a year after we unofficially met in a club in Holland. Todd L. Burns What do you think was in Alex’s mind? because the story goes he said, “I think
you two need to talk for a while.” What do you think he thought was going to
happen? Francesco Tristano For once, Carl remembered me because we went up with Rami. He said, “You’re the
guys who came up to me after the gig.” I said, “Yeah.” Alex didn’t have a precise goal, but he knew I was listening to a lot of Carl’s music. By the time I met him I knew all of his stuff by heart, and when I say by heart I
mean I could play all his stuff. So I was really into his music and I guess
about six months later I went to Detroit for the first time and we worked on
the “Melody” remix, that was the
first collaboration. The original piano takes from the melody were taken in a
classical way, so not necessarily closed micing but more ambient micing, and
Carl is like, “I can’t use those takes for my remix. You better come to Detroit and
we’ll do this again.” I went to Detroit and I re-recorded some piano parts, some bass parts. Then he made the two remixes and that was the first thing we
started working on together, Innerzone [Orchestra]. Then one thing big thing
was with an orchestra, which was called “Versus.” It has evolved since. Todd L. Burns I think the video’s still online of this performance in Paris where he’s on
electronics and you’re playing piano and there’s this enormous orchestra
playing stuff. Must have been pretty special. Francesco Tristano It was a lot of work. I spent about two months arranging stuff for the orchestra; then we got a conductor, so he was on the project for a while. Then we had one week of rehearsals and it all came together, the day of the show,
really. For an orchestra to work with electronic musicians is not easy. Also there’s a whole bunch of technical things you need to coordinate, like the
sound. We play amplified, we play with onstage monitors, some had click tracks, I had click tracks for this. And the conductor had a click track, but he was dancing by the end of the show, he was onstage, he didn’t look like he
was conducting, he was just having a great time. It was a great experience and
to be repeated, definitely. We’ve evolved the project into other versions. In Germany this year we played a couple of shows where I conduct the orchestra
and we play much more freely now. It’s kind of a DJ set between Carl, Moritz
and I and at times the orchestra comes in and then goes out again, a
continuous mix of music. Todd L. Burns What’s the most surprising thing about Carl, having worked with him? Francesco Tristano Surprising? I don’t know. He’s a great personality in that he doesn’t think
small, he doesn’t think techno necessarily. There’s some comparison to be
drawn with Miles Davis, who definitely didn’t just think jazz; he went beyond
that. It’s the kind of personality that’s so important for his or her own art,
but also for the artist around them who’s not doing the same thing. There’s only a few people who can do that. It’s complicated to make it happen. First
of all, if you start working with classical musicians you have to adapt your
language. You can’t talk about groove – they have no idea what groove means.
You can’t talk about the feel of things, it doesn’t make sense. It’s all
written out, it’s all notes on paper. Todd L. Burns So were you his translator? Or does he have that language now, can he speak in
those terms? Francesco Tristano We all learned a lot in the process, but I was definitely some kind of
mediator between those two worlds. And the conductor did a great job of making
it happen with the orchestra. But it’s basically getting to know each other. Orchestra musicians are yet another special breed of classical musicians and
sometimes it’s really hard to make it happen. Also, I love to play loops and
orchestras hate playing loops. When they have one bar written and it says 268
times, they get kind of upset. After 100 bars they’re off by about a beat, so
I’ll stop the thing and say, “You’re off by a beat.” “Yeah, but I’ve already
played it 100 times.” “Yeah, you have 168 more to go.” (laughs) Todd L. Burns Moritz von Oswald has done some ‘not production,’ those other words he used to
describe what he’s done on some of the records. Was it the bachCage one where he was credited as enchanting? Francesco Tristano That was Auricle. Todd L. Burns What does that mean? Francesco Tristano It’s a mystery, a secret. No, Moritz and I worked on a record a couple of times, one was Auricle. The last is bachCage, which he produced full on, no mystery about that. But Auricle / Bio / On came very spontaneously. I had a whole bunch of piano samples, there’s no live piano on this record. It’s
kind of a direct antagonist to Not For Piano, which is a piano record where
I play live. Auricle was the other end, there’s no live piano, only samples,
I did the mix inside the box. I basically had a stereo file, which sounded okay but I’m no sound engineer and I’m definitely no mastering engineer and I
counted on Moritz to make it sound good, and I think he did. So it was definitely more than a mastering job because a mastering job basically means EQing and maybe a little bit of compressing and that’s it. But he managed to feature some parts of the original and process them again, isolating several frequencies so the whole track becomes... he made kind of a 3D version of a 2D track. For bachCage he was very present from the beginning on. It was a
project where I played some music from Bach and Cage and a few pieces of mine,
very short. One of them we had the pleasure of playing yesterday with the students onstage. With Moritz, we set up the mics, we processed the music together. You can definitely hear the Moritz von Oswald touch on bachCage, more than on Auricle because he had more freedom. Todd L. Burns Can we play something from the bachCage where we can hear Moritz? Francesco Tristano How about this one (looks through laptop, music starts and stops)? (music: Francesco Tristano – “In A Landscape” / applause) This is a piece from 1948 by John Cage called “In A Landscape” and basically
what we did is we had about 20 mics on the piano, of which we used just over half.
Maybe some were just regular in the mix the way they were recorded and the
other five mics went into a whole sidechain of processing boxes, the heavy
ring modulator, Moritz von Oswald delay and, of course, reverb and phaser. And
it’s all basically live in post-production. So I recorded the take live and
Moritz’s processing was done as a second layer. This for me is an important
record because it’s the first time I was not afraid to use these processing
tools for classical production. John Cage is not necessarily a classical
composer, but the label is a classical label. Todd L. Burns It came out on Deutsche Grammophon, which I think is important to note. Francesco Tristano Also, if you go to a record store John Cage will be in the classical section.
It’s not the current thing to do to use ring modulators when you record a
classical piano album, but that’s exactly what I did for the previous album,
which was my music, Idiosynkrasi. Most of the pieces I played yesterday are on my second album, I guess my third album. But now there’s no return, I think I told you
this before. For me, there’s no difference now if I play classical music. When
I say classical, it’s really in quotes. I don’t even know what it means. I
think we use it in an anachronistic way because the word classical itself is
fairly recent. It’s about 150 years old and it was used to describe the music
before that. Now, 150 years later, we call music from even 50 years ago
classical. So classical is really the same as contemporary in a way. But, now for me there’s no difference; if I play music by a composer from another time
or play my own music, the sound of the piano will always be processed. Not always, but mostly, because I think it’s one way to evolve the sound of the piano into something else, in relationship to my own time. In rock productions, in techno productions, you use all these machines, but in classics or jazz you don’t. But there’s no reason not to. Todd L. Burns Why did it take you so long to get there with the classical stuff? Or was it
that the classical industry also had to get there to allow you to do something
like this for Deutsche Grammophon? You say this record is a breakthrough for
you, in a way, you felt like you passed through some place. Francesco Tristano Like I say, my whole electronic education came after my classical education. I guess I didn’t know how to combine the two, but now I do. In fact, there’s no difference whether I play a piece by Bach or my own music. Why it took me so long, I think it’s just a natural organic process of trying to integrate all
the things I learned and trying to define my sound. As a pianist you spend a lot of time working on your sound analogically, it’s in your fingertips, it’s in the weight of the elbow and the arm and the back, it’s all important parts of how the piano is going to sound. But then the mics, they pick up something
completely different and when you send the mics into a processing box you get
something totally different but you get something personal. I suppose it’s about finding a sound that describes me best. I have no interest in playing the so-called role-playing game of classical music, where you interpret
something from the past in an old way. If I do it I have to do it in a new way
and using technology definitely helps me in that direction. Todd L. Burns It must also have been a big deal from the other side to have Moritz doing a classical record. Did it take some convincing at the record label? “I’m bringing my own guy in, just trust me.” Francesco Tristano No, no. Todd L. Burns He’d already done the record, I guess, with Carl. Francesco Tristano Yeah, he’d composed. He was in it from the start, we wanted to do this together and Auricle though is not entirely the same thing, it’s sort of a remix project, it’s not necessarily a classical playlist. But Moritz was totally excited to do it because I guess it’s some kind of challenge for a
techno or dub producer to produce music by Bach. I love these completely crazy ideas and Moritz, I wanted to go further than him. He said, “Maybe I’ll do something very light.” I said, “Moritz we want more of this ring modulator, turn it up, turn it up,” just to give it that special flavor. I was very
happy to play with you guys yesterday. The piece we did was a very short
excerpt – I say excerpt because it was cut down on the original record to one
and a half minutes. There is a remix by Lawrence. I don’t know if
you want to listen to it real quick. Todd L. Burns Sure. Francesco Tristano This is also on Deutsche Grammophon. (music: Francesco Tristano – “Tristano Introit (Lawrence remix)“) Todd L. Burns So that was Lawrence. (applause) For anyone that was there last night, they can immediately recognize the
little melodic riff there. I find it interesting that Lawrence, given the
chance to do a mix of a John Cage piece or a Bach piece, he chose you. Not
that you aren’t fascinating in your own right. Francesco Tristano Yeah, I was happy that he chose to do “Introit.” I think of all my pieces as
some kind of work in progress. As I said before, every original piece is already a version of some previous idea that we cannot fully grasp because it’s in the head of the composer or the producer. Obviously, when you do a record there’s a lot of effort that goes into editing and mastering. Already the piece is going to sound different, a different shape, different structure. But then the remixing by other people is one more version, it’s a collaboration but it’s another version. I think what we did last night was a version,
probably my favourite version so far. I think we could’ve rolled another half
an hour or so. I’m still working on this piece, just as I’m still working on
“Hello,” the first piece I played last night. The composition is about five or six years old, but I keep trying to make it evolve and go other places. One
way to do it is with adding programming and sequencing and the other way is to
get other people to remix it. Todd L. Burns So how do you know when a track on Idiosynkrasia, say, is done? Francesco Tristano They’re not. That’s the thing. We think when we bring out an album... Todd L. Burns They are. (laughs) Francesco Tristano They’re not, those are versions. Those are the versions known as
Idiosynkrasia. Todd L. Burns So you just set a deadline that someone gave you. “OK, that’s the version I
can finish.” Francesco Tristano I guess. But really, I want to make a point of this: it’s not when you bring
out a record that the music is done. That’s only the beginning of the music,
the beginning of the life of the music. Once you put out the record you
understand a few things you didn’t understand while you were in the process of
making the music. It would be too bad to sit back and say, “Hey that music’s
done. If someone wants to remix, that’s cool, but I’m not going to touch it again.” I think it’s just the beginning. When you bring out a record, we think
that’s the end. The media say it’s a good record or it’s a bad record, it’s
better than the last one or not as good as the last one. But actually, it’s
just one long process and each record is going to be related to the previous
one and a hint towards the next one. It’s basically just one long work in
progress. It’s definitely not definitive versions. Todd L. Burns It’s related to one of the things you said when I interviewed you about six
months ago, that all great composers find their own language, define their own
language. I wonder if you feel like you’re getting there, that you’re finding
your own language? Or is it just a work in progress? Francesco Tristano It’s not up to me to determine whether I’ve found my language or not, but I
started this thing about 10 years ago, trying to combine the sound of the
piano with the sound of electronic music. Because I love both: I love the
sound of the piano and I love techno. I was under the impression that there’s still a lot to do and I still have this impression. If you can find some
idiosyncratic things about my music then I suppose that’s a good thing, but
I’m not done. Now I explore the same idea but in a more classical repertoire.
The next project could be completely different, more towards the future than
the past, but the aesthetic is still going to be the same. It’s kind of like a
sound research thing where you get ideas, you try to develop them, you bring
out records and they help you put a milestone in your own progress, your own
development. But in no way are they to be taken as the last word. So I’m
always a little surprised when the press say an album is a new thing and it’s
finished. I don’t think that way. Each album is one step in whatever you’re
doing in music. Todd L. Burns Bach and Cage seem unlikely bedfellows. In your mind, what was the connection and why did you want to put them next to each other on an album? Francesco Tristano For one, it was my conviction that old music doesn’t have to be shielded from
contemporary music. In fact, contemporary musics, plural, because there’s a
lot of stuff. I like to put a juxtaposition of old and new but in a continuous
way. In fact, bachCage is like a DJ set with music by Cage and Bach. The first statement is that old music is actually a part of our language, we’re
going to hear it in 2011 the same way as we’re going to hear the latest techno
production. Then Cage and Bach definitely connect on certain levels. They’re both minimalists, definitely. Bach was one of the first great minimalists.
There’s something very, very similar in the way they write their scores;
they’re very basic scores, no indications, just the music and a title, maybe a
word or two. Bach doesn’t even write the word, just a title and the music –
that’s it. They connect on a rhythmic level, they use very definite rhythmic
forms, rhythmic patterns. Bach’s music, especially his instrumental music, is
all based on dance, baroque forms of dance that now seem completely out, like
the sarabande. Would you like to dance a sarabande with me? I have no idea how
to dance the sarabande. But I suppose 300 years ago people did know what a
sarabande is, just as we know what a house track is or dubstep or whatever dance you want to call it. John Cage uses these patterns and he’s very strict so the piece we listened to, “In A Landscape,” sounds like this dreamy thing, sort of ambient stuff, but actually the rhythmic structure is completely defined. I don’t remember exactly but it’s completely separated in several sections where the total amount of beats is the sum of the previous section.
It’s kind of a crazy organization of rhythm but it’s definitely comparable to
Bach. Last but not least, both are very spiritual in the sense that they are
abstract, and kind of universal. When I listen to music by Bach or by Cage I
don’t need any other information and it transports me somewhere. I don’t know where, but it’s a kind of feeling that I get, that they had a really high
understanding of humans. I don’t want to philosophize too much about this, but Bach/Cage,
four letters, also the same first name, Johann Sebastian Bach and John Cage.
So a few analogies. Todd L. Burns Before we open it up to questions, I want to ask you, you recently played at
Space, Ibiza with
Carl. Was it the first time you’ve played in a club environment like that with
the grand piano? Francesco Tristano No, we already did Space with Carl the previous season, so it was a repeat. I
do play in clubs a lot, but it’s rare to have a grand piano. In fact, I also
did the closing party with Luciano at Pacha Vagabundos and we didn’t have a
piano, it was too complicated the stage was too small. I suppose Space is
easier. Todd L. Burns It has a very big stage. Francesco Tristano It has a good stage and there’s space besides the DJ booth.
Pacha is more complicated because Luciano is over
there (points) in the DJ booth and it’s more crowded. I was about 20-25
meters on the opposite side and we barely saw each other, but it was all trying to connect in the music. I love playing in clubs. What I did yesterday
is kind of a hybrid thing. Usually, what I do is either I play a piano recital
in a seated hall, could be amplified, could have electronics, but it’s not necessarily beat-y or dance-y; or I do a techno live set for dancefloor in
clubs with keyboards. I usually have two or three keyboards plus my little machines and my computer. So yesterday was a bit of a hybrid because it was kind of a concert, but I was also playing more beats than I usually do in a
concert hall, because the soundsystem in concert halls is mostly not adapted
for ‘subby’ music, so you have to go easy on the speakers. Todd L. Burns Is there an ideal place? I saw people sitting down and moving in their chairs,
they’re not quite comfortable, and people standing up were maybe wanting to
sit down. Is there a place you feel is the ideal format to hear what you do? Francesco Tristano To me, they complement each other very well and it’s vital for me to switch
and play in different environments. I think every hall is ideal as long as you
try to get it all out. When you feel the vibe and you can connect with the
audience, whether it’s a quiet audience sitting in chairs or a crazy audience
dancing as if there’s no tomorrow, it’s complementary. I love to go back and
forth. Also, these hybrid formats are very interesting, there maybe new
sensations, you don’t really know what to expect. In fact, I don’t know what to
expect. I know what I want to play but I adapt. I had some tracklist in my
mind before I started playing yesterday and it was completely changed
throughout the show because I was feeling it out. Of course, it all had to lead
up to the grand finale with the students. Todd L. Burns Speaking of students, does anyone have any questions they’d like to ask? Audience Member I have two questions. First of all, you were talking about the history of the
piano. To my knowledge, when the piano was first invented there wasn’t a set tuning scale at that time, so people tuned to their own pianos. Have you
explored any different tuning systems at all or do you stick to the classic
12-tone system? Francesco Tristano You’re right, it has only been formatted since Bach onwards. Before Bach there
were very few distinctive tuning systems. Tuning is a profession in its own
[right]. I can play around but I’ll eventually break the piano if I tune it
too much. But I have worked with tuners, crazy guys who are absolutely willing
to experiment with the tuning. You can get into antique tunings where the relationship of the intervals is specific to each key. So, for example, if I
tell this very special tuner I know, “Look, I’m going to play some music by
Frescobaldi and the keys are F major and A minor and C major,” he thinks for a
second and starts tuning. Every modulation is such a big event because the
relationship between the intervals is shocking. We don’t hear it that way. Or
you can go a completely different way, you can tune it with quarter-tones and
go into more traditional Arab scales or go into completely crazy tuning
systems. Everything’s possible but I can’t tune it on my own, I need a tuner
to do it for me. Audience Member Thank you. Secondly, your exploration of electronica and piano or classical
music, you’ve said the word “techno” a lot. Does that mean that you’re really
only interested in working with a 4/4 beat pattern? The piano, like you’re
saying, is a percussive instrument, so you’re talking about complex percussive
things that interest you, but then when it comes to the electronic part the
producers you’re working with seem to stick to the 4/4 format. So do you have
any interest in doing something more complicated or different? Francesco Tristano Definitely. I have no issue with doing the 4/4, I love it. But the cool thing
about having the four equal beats is you can do so much between the beats. If
you have a kickdrum accentuating every beat, what I do harmonically or on the
piano is pretty much syncopated. There’s so much space between the beats to
make the groove happen. So it’s not like a limit or anything, it’s just a
common denominator, just as in classical music you have certain figures like
alberti bass. I can show this briefly, something like this. (plays Wurlitzer) All over classical music you hear something like that and it’s always the same
but it’s always different. But I definitely like abstract beats and I’ve
worked with other people like Sutekh, who’s not into heavy four-to-the-floor. I’m definitely also into sound music where there’s no beat at all. The piano
has these ambient properties where you don’t need a beat, you can just be
spacey. Audience Member I play drums and I feel that in the last 25 years all the evolution in rhythm
and beat culture has come from people who don’t play drums. That’s a common
perception among drummers, it’s electronic producers and programmers who’ve
evolved beat culture. Do you feel the same about harmony? Francesco Tristano Interesting point. I absolutely agree with you, I think once we got machines –
not just drummachines, but also synthesizers – the way organic musicians play
has changed, absolutely. You said before that the very specific chord progression could be from a non-composer because it’s basically just playing
around and finding the chords. What I find interesting is that it becomes another language, it becomes a new kind of thing. Detroit techno, for example,
you hear a lot of pentatonic stuff. It’s laid out pretty easily because it’s
just the black keys, for example, but it becomes a very specific sound. And
the way you listen to it, I don’t necessarily hear it as a pentatonic scale, I
hear it as a new conglomerate of pitches that determine what the harmony of
the piece is going to be. I’m not sure how far I can go with the analogy. I think Carl Craig is a great harmonizer, for example, he’s got some great
harmonies. So is Mad Mike from Underground Resistance, he’s more from a gospel
and jazz background. But these evolutions, it’s not linear in that before it
was that and now it’s that (moves hand up a few inches). But it’s basically
a circle, we can go back and forwards. It just becomes a much richer harmonic
language, just as it’s become a much richer rhythmic language since the advent
of beat machines and stuff like that. So I think now it’s about amplifying
your field and we have to learn from each other. It’s only about this, I
think. But you’re definitely right, the beatboxing has changed a lot of
perception in rhythmic structure when it comes to organic drumming. And I
count myself among you guys because, like I said, I play the drums in the
piano, I like to play the drums. Audience Member I have a couple of questions. First, that version of “In A Landscape,” where
and when was it recorded? Francesco Tristano A studio in Berlin, August 2010. Audience Member Just that I’ve been listening to it for a little while and I don’t even know
where I got it, but the version I have on my computer is totally uncredited.
That blew me away when you played it, I’ve even sampled it a couple of times.
I hope that isn’t a problem (laughs). Francesco Tristano You won’t have a problem with me, you might have one with John Cage’s
publisher (laughs). Audience Member And second, do you ever see yourself moving away from the piano completely and
diving deeper into synthesized sounds, maybe even harmonic samples? Francesco Tristano Yeah, definitely. Ultimately, all these projects to combine sound from
electronic and acoustic realms eventually will bring me further from the
piano. They already bring me further from the piano because I have so many
other elements to count on, more than the piano. I’m happy when I have a piano on stage because I feel at home and if my laptop dies or my MIDI controller
goes away, there’s no power or whatever, the piano will still sound. It’s a nice companion to have onstage because it will always sound no matter what happens. There can be bombs, it doesn’t matter, there will always be sound.
There was a piano sounding when the Titanic went down, I think. But yeah, definitely. Probably you noticed, I play the piano but I don’t play so much
and when I play a lot then it’s a loop, always the same. I’m not into soloing right hand and chorusing, it’s more of a minimalistic approach and I guess the
extreme end would be to not play the piano anymore. Not for now, but who knows, could be in the future. Audience Member What I noticed yesterday in the show is there’s quite a lot of emotional
content to the music, but there’s quite a lot of dissonance as well. Where
does that come from? What’s your interest in dissonance within that sort of
music? Francesco Tristano Interesting question. I was reading some lectures by John Cage the other day
and he said the old way to compose was to discern between consonance and
dissonance and the new way to compose is to discern organized sound versus
noise, what he calls noise. It could be unorganized or chaotic sounds or
whatnot. The dissonance is only dissonant if it’s surprising. If everything’s
dissonant then it’s no longer dissonant, it just becomes consonant. So I do
like to work with simple harmonies, simple chords, major trials, minor trials,
sometimes a seventh. But then at some point I like to break it, I like to
break it, just as when you set a marker, you have a before and an after, so
once you introduce the dissonance all the consonant stuff before will be
transformed for the next part. The way I see it, I suppose, is very spontaneous and I can’t really calculate when it’s going to come in. But in
the programming there’s kind of a lot of dissonance because whatever I play at
the piano – and I say, I like to be as free as I can – when I play live I like
to play both hands. Sometimes you’ll see me EQ something and I have the right
hand still playing, but the consonance is in our ear, so to speak. But
nowadays in 2011 we hear everything different, we hear such a large range of
music and nothing is shocking anymore. The most dissonant stuff is not
shocking because we’ve heard it. So I’d like to go the other way, so if you
play a lot of pleasing harmonies and then you play something different it’s
kind of a shock. The first piece I played tonight, the Gibbons, it’s the same
way. It starts out pretty soft and minor-y, and then all of a sudden it goes
completely out. It’s not necessarily dissonant but it’s a progression that’s
not within the tonal structure of music and it’s a surprise. I like to create
new context for the way we listen to music, even if it’s old music –
especially if it’s old music. New music can’t really shock you anymore, old
music can. It’s difficult to shock nowadays, I don’t know the last time I was
shocked when I heard something. I think it’s refreshing to listen to the old
stuff. The piece I played yesterday was 400 years old and very dissonant at
times. It’s what gets me thinking, “Well, maybe this wall between old and new
is all an illusion.” Audience Member Thanks. Todd L. Burns Does anyone else have any questions? Well, thank you very much, Francesco.

Gareth Jones
Gareth Jones was in on the ground when synthesizers began to dominate pop music. As the mixer of John Foxx’s seminal album Metamatic, he realized that an artist could truly define his sound with electronics. Then, as the co-producer of many of Depeche Mode’s greatest works, he helped to create experimental music with global chart appeal.
In this lecture at the 2011 Red Bull Music Academy, he talks about taking samplers to a scrapyard and a career that confidently bridges the gap between Einstürzende Neubauten and Erasure.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt Now we’re going to listen to some reggae music, I guess. But before we do that
I’d like you to welcome a man who was at the very center of a development that
brought so much noise to that public mainstream airwaves like probably very few
other entities. So, please welcome Mr Gareth Jones. (applause) Gareth Jones Thanks Torsten, thanks everyone. It’s a pleasure to be here and thanks for your time and
attention. Torsten Schmidt Right, let’s start with a bit of reggae here. (music: Prince Buster – “Al Capone”) Torsten Schmidt How good are your David Rodigan impressions? Gareth Jones Not very good. Torsten Schmidt I might be a little bit closer to the old bald dude with glasses, but I’m not going anywhere near it. But this man used to be a bouncer, who became a boxer, then he became an artist, then he became known as an artist called Prince Buster. Then he was immortalized by a British group called Madness. And what does that have to do with you? Gareth Jones My connection to Madness is that a very long time ago, in the late ’70s, when
I started working in studios, I recorded their first single. They came into a
little studio I was working in called Pathway in North London, which was really scummy and really dirty and smelly and tiny and old. They came in with Clive Langer producing and I recorded their first single. That’s the B-side; “The Prince” I think is the
A-side to this single. Torsten Schmidt Let’s give that a spin. (music: Madness – “The Prince” / applause) Gareth Jones Let’s clap the band and their producer. That was the first time I ever saw a
chorus echo, a Space Echo. Clive
came in with a space echo. Up until then we’d been making echoes in the studio
with two-track tape machines, like Revoxes, which were much more
limited. The thing about the Space Echo that was really cool was it had three
heads on it. So, you could get echoes that go “bum-ba-ba-bum,” which is very
hard to do with Revoxes. Because there’s a cool rhythmic relationship between
the three heads on the space echoes. A little technical aside there. But
anyway, that was a big part of the sound Clive is creating on this track, the
space echo. Torsten Schmidt What put you in the position of being actually in this studio up in Stoke
Newington, which was a pretty different neighborhood back then, I suppose? Gareth Jones I was living in Brixton, actually. I wanted to make recordings of bands,
because I loved music and I loved technology from when I was a kid and I had a
little valve tape recorder. Obviously, we heard Matias [Aguayo] talk about his early recording, loads off us have done early
recording. This guy who owned a demo studio, but very nice… somehow it
functioned, a lot of great records were made there. A guy called Mike Finesilver gave me a break. I
wrote a bunch of letters trying to get a job in a studio, and Mike gave me a
break and hired me in this studio. I didn’t really have a clue. I remember the
first time, I’d never recorded a drum kit before I was in this studio. I was
recording the drum kit and the drummer asked me to turn the snare drum up. I
didn’t know which was the snare drum. So, I was kind of, “Er, OK,” so I turned
one of them up. I can’t remember if I got that one right. It was learning by
doing. I was never a punk, I was more like a hippie freak. But what I took from punk
was the do-it-yourself thing. I was very happy to be learning from myself,
teaching myself, and learning from all the great colleagues and musicians I
was with, of course. Torsten Schmidt You had a bit of formal training prior to that, right? Gareth Jones I got a job at the radio station. See, my thing was, I went to college and then I
didn’t know what to do with my life, man. So, I decided I wanted to try
recording music, because I loved music and I was really interested in recording
technology. I didn’t know how to do it. Obviously, there were no laptops. We
had a little four-track tape recorder in the basement of the squat where I was living
in Brixton. Somehow, I managed to get a job at the BBC. In fact, my dad helped
me do that, rest in peace. He actually died a couple of weeks ago so it’s nice
to mention him. When I went in the first little studio I worked at the BBC it
was a real achievement to be able to put sound in one end of the mixing desk
and get it to come out of the speakers. So, it was very, very early days for
me. But what I got from the BBC was a lifelong love of radio – I had that
before even, because as a kid, a teenager, living in Nowheresville in England,
a lot of the really interesting music I got to hear came through the radio. We all
talk about John Peel; John Peel was
an icon for generations of music lovers. And of course, I’m a big classical
music fan as well, a lot of that came through the radio. But, also, they taught
me a little bit about microphones and mixing desks, how it’s supposed to work.
Nothing that useful for rock & roll bands or pop bands, but it gave me an
edge, so this guy Mike, who was a musician and a producer, thought, “OK, I’ll
give the guy a break. Why not? He can probably do something.” And I met him
and had a chat, so that was useful. Torsten Schmidt Talking about your hippie past… obviously tough to imagine that right now. Gareth Jones [Laughs] Thanks a lot, peace man. Torsten Schmidt Hey, I had long hair once myself, actually around the time that another band you
recorded a lot later, Inspiral Carpets, had long hair. But
even that’s millennia ago… There’s this guy, he called you a “Freudian hippie dropout…” Gareth Jones Is that John Foxx? Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Gareth Jones John Foxx was a great electronic musician, he’s done a really cool record
Recently… Interplay, with
John Foxx and The Maths. It’s a really
outstanding piece of modern electronic pop, underground pop. I’m very critical of
some of my old colleagues and I was amazed at John’s new record. So, he meant
that… I don’t know what he meant. That I was a freak, I suppose. I’ve always
been interested in psychology, psychoanalysis, and I’ve had many productive years on the
couch with a wonderful Freudian therapist. That’s perhaps another story for
another conference. Torsten Schmidt Well, we have the couch right here. Gareth Jones We have the couch, but perhaps not the therapist. Torsten Schmidt Gareth, is there something you wanted to share with us? Gareth Jones Well, I had some interesting dreams last night, Torsten [laughter]. Torsten Schmidt How did those dreams make you feel? Gareth Jones They made me feel good. Anyway… Torsten Schmidt Can you recall what was in the center of that dream? Gareth Jones Yes, but it wouldn’t be suitable to share with a web-streaming audience.
Joking aside, I didn’t write my dreams down this morning. I think dreams are a
wonderful source of inspiration for all of us. When I’m on it I try to capture
my dreams and write them down. I highly recommend having a notebook by your
bed, if you can get it together. I get the most wonderful things from dreams, lyrics, musical ideas. I often dream about work, sometimes about solutions to
problems at work, sonic problems or emotional problems. A lot of the work I do is with
bands, so there’s a lot of interactions going on, like a family, I guess.
There’s a lot of connections and cross-interactions, so it’s important to understand
the dynamic of the groups you work with. So, I’ve always been interested in
psychoanalysis and psychology. As a dropout – I had a formal education, which
was very useful for me, because I met loads of wonderful people and it helped me think. But I tried to put it on one side and do something else. So, I didn’t become
the lawyer, the doctor or the schoolteacher that my mother might have wished
me to become. So, in a sense I dropped out of the system. I felt like I had dropped out of the system. Though I didn’t
really, because I’m still using electricity and rail travel and the car and
water that comes out of the tap. But at the time I felt I’d dropped out of the
system a little bit. And I was for many years a big fan of psychedelic drugs,
so that is the hippie dropout Freudian thing. Not that I would recommend
psychedelic drugs to anyone now, for fear of the danger of litigation. Torsten Schmidt [Laughter] On that note, to multi-change the subject, did you see the
Fellini Book of Dreamsthat he wrote a couple of
years, where he wrote down all the dreams and watercolored them? Gareth Jones Did he? How beautiful. It’s a great source of inspiration, the subconscious,
isn’t it? I’m not a songwriter, but a lot of my dear friends are fantastic
songwriters and several of them have said they don’t know where the ideas come
from. Songs in some sense arrive in the songwriter’s space. That’s not to say that
work’s not important, listening to music is not important, developing your skills is not important. But to me
there is a sense that when a song arrives, it comes from somewhere. Maybe it’s
a gift from God. But it certainly comes from somewhere, so I think we need to
pay attention to our unconscious drives. Torsten Schmidt What song does your unconscious remember the most of that Metamatic album? Gareth Jones Yes, John came into this studio at Pathway. He had this idea… does anyone know
John Foxx? Torsten Schmidt We have a couple of examples here that we could play. Gareth Jones He had this idea to make a minimal electronic pop album, and following on from
one of the things Matias said this morning, it was the fourth album he’d
made; he’d done three with a band called
Ultravox, before Midge Ure became the singer. And he worked
with some of the great masters, including Conny Plank, who’s now long dead, but a fantastic German krautrock and electronic producer. Torsten Schmidt What are some of your favorite Conny Plank productions? Gareth Jones I like the work he did with Neu!and Cluster. So, John had this idea to make a minimal electronic pop album, so what
he did was… he’d worked in quite big studios by then, certainly they seemed to
me massive studios, compared to where I’d been working. This was an eight-track
analog studio. The control room was about this big, way more primitive than
the wonderful production rooms Red Bull have built here. So, to make a minimal
record, he decided to have minimal equipment, which is one of the things Matias
was referring to this morning. He didn’t say, “I’m gonna go into a really big
studio with loads of money and have loads of big synthesizers and loads of
microphones and make a minimal record.” He was very much a conceptual fine artist,
John… so he said, “I’m gonna make a minimal record. Therefore, I’m going to have use one
drum machine, one Arp Odyssey,
one Elka string machine and one Arp 16-step analogue sequencer.” I
don’t know if you’ve seen that, but it’s really cool. There’s lot of digital
emulations of that now, Five12 make a wonderful
piece of software called Numerology. If
anyone’s interested in step sequencing, I highly recommend Numerology by
Five12, it’s amazing. It’s really deep, but the Arp is like a tiny version of
that. And eight tracks, and we only had eight tracks. So, that’s how he
approached making a minimal piece of work. And, of course, it turned out very
minimal. I like the whole album, actually. Play something, why don’t you? Torsten Schmidt Let’s start at the beginning then. (music: John Foxx – “Plaza”) (music: John Foxx – “Touch And Go” / applause) Torsten Schmidt So, as far as the minimal record goes, in that sort of format, we’re talking
what, 1980 here? Gareth Jones Yeah, ’79, ’80. Torsten Schmidt This is with a guy who has worked with Ultravox, Brian Eno, Conny Plank, and there you are. You’re straight out of the BBC and a massive track record already. How nervous were you? Gareth Jones Oh, I wasn’t nervous. I was very overconfident as a young guy, which is what a
lot of us need or we don’t get shit done. But when I look back I’m quite
surprised at how overconfident I was. I was a bit arrogant, I’d say. I wasn’t
arrogant with John… or perhaps I was, actually. But I wasn’t nervous. I didn’t
know very much about Ultravox. I discovered Ultravox through John more than the other way around. Of course, I worked as an engineer on this project because I was very much a junior, but it is interesting when I look back. There
were two other musicians on this record, both friends of mine who I brought
into the project. One was Alan Durant, who played bass guitar on
a few tracks, and one was a guy called John Wesley Barker, who played a few
keyboards on some of the tracks. Looking back, that’s a map of how you make
records; there’s an artist and songwriter. But there’s no way I produced
Metamatic, I didn’t even know what record production was in those days. But
when John came in we just started work. I was already a big synthesizer lover.
One of my mates had got a
Wasp synthesizer, which was
cheap, had a touch-sensitive keyboard, very cheap. Late ’70s, early ’80s, much
cheaper than a Moog, unreliable really,
didn’t work very well. But also, in the ’60s, my tiny mind was blown by
hearing Walter Carlos, he did – or she later became Wendy Carlos – and he/she did an
incredible record called Switched On Bach, which is Johann Sebastian Bach’s music played on Moog modular
synths. I’d heard this in the ’60s when I was about 15. I knew some of the
music of Bach, because I’d been to church, and my father was a big classical
music lover. When I talked about dropping out, I said I felt I’d rebelled
against everything I was brought up and educated to do. Many years later, I
realized my father’s main hobby was listening to records and enjoying
listening to music. So, after having thought that I’d really stepped aside from my
upbringing and programming, it turned out that actually I was just trying to
please my dad all along by making records and fucking around with hi-fis… an
interesting psychological aside. But I knew the music of Bach, like loads of people do, the hits from Bach on
Switched on Bach. So, to hear it played almost robotically on sequencers and
Moog synths set something off in my head. It was super-interesting. So, when
John came into the studio wanting to make the first entirely electronic record
I’d ever made, I connected to that straight away. For me, in the beginning in
pop music, synths were thought of as almost not viable, not real instruments. They
were for people who couldn’t play or didn’t have proper musical ideas. It’s
not like that any more; synthesizers and samplers have been totally
incorporated into popular music culture. When it started, it wasn’t like that,
but I was really able and willing and happy to embrace it. So, I was
very open to what John was trying to do. By the way, the drum machine on
Metamatic, the CR-78, I don’t
know if anyone knows what that is. A square box with lots of pre-programmed
rhythms on it. That’s the drum machine you just heard on Metamatic. Torsten Schmidt Did you try and program it yourself as well? Gareth Jones I think you can, but I don’t think we were very good at that. You might be able to do some beat programming on the CR-78. Can you do that? Have you got a CR-78? Torsten Schmidt Theoretically you can, yeah. Gareth Jones We might have managed to do something on it, I don’t remember. But I do
remember using lots of different presets, different tempos and working round the presets. Maybe
there was some original programming; I’ve got a vague memory that it was
possible to program. Torsten Schmidt I’d like to play you a little something and you just blurt out whatever comes
to mind. (music: The Normal – “Warm Leatherette” / applause) Gareth Jones Absolutely. I’m not involved in the making of this track in any way, but it’s
a seminal track in my life. It’s the legendary “Warm Leatherette,” written and
performed by The Normal, which is Daniel Miller, who is
obviously now boss – I don’t now what his title is – of Mute Records, and he is one
of the really important mentors in my life. I’ve learned, and I do still learn a
great deal from Daniel. The first time I heard it, John Foxx brought it into
Pathway and said, “You have got to listen to this now.” It was very important
for a lot of us. It was the first track ever released on Mute Records. Daniel
founded Mute in order to make this track. He went to the cutting room, he
recorded it at home on a four-track, quarter-inch tape recorder. The drums
sound like sequenced drums but they’re not; he’s actually playing the drums,
playing synth drums as if sequenced, because he couldn’t get the sequencer
working at that point. He didn’t quite know how to work a sequencer or sync it
up. He went to the cutting room with this record and the engineer said, “Don’t
give up the day job, mate.” That’s all I can say about that. We’re talking
about Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records, mogul, genius producer, genius
businessman, phenomenally successful and wealthy, dare we say it, since it is a
job after all… So, that’s something to bear in mind very much, isn’t it? Don’t listen to the so-
called experts. If you believe it, just do it. Because that’s a typical example
of a so-called expert. “You’re not going anywhere with this, mate, you might
as well give up, go back to minicab driving.” Torsten Schmidt Is that what he was doing? Gareth Jones Daniel was a minicab driver, yeah. I think he was an assistant film editor as
well, but by the time he made this record he needed the space that minicab
driving gave him to be creative. Torsten Schmidt What do you know about that Silicon Teens record? Gareth Jones Not very much. Torsten Schmidt He was somehow involved in that. Gareth Jones Yeah, super-involved. I think the publisher,
Ron Buckle of Sonet Music at the
time, had an idea that what they needed to do was a cover version. This was a
record company thing. [Affects voice] “It’s all very well having original
material, but do a good cover version you’ll have a hit.” I suspect that might
have been the publisher’s idea, but the publisher’s not earning much money
because most of the songs are published elsewhere. Daniel’s very involved in it
and Fad Gadget, another esteemed
dead colleague, is singing on it too. Torsten Schmidt They all go under different names. Gareth Jones But obviously Silicon Teens is all right, but it’s just a bit of fun, it
doesn’t compare. When “Warm Leatherette” came out, it was like punk
electronica. Totally do-it-yourself ethic, raw; doesn’t sound that raw now obviously, in
the same way the Sex Pistols don’t – it sounds like tuneful pop if you listen
now. I don’t know if you’ve listened recently but it’s amazing, like perfect
little pop songs. But at the time, it sounds really raw shit, man. Like
Nirvana, even Nirvana doesn’t sound raw anymore. Obviously, great songwriting
and wonderful musicianship, incredibly important music. But that raw edge… same
with “Warm Leatherette” actually, it fits, still sounds contemporary. But at
the time it was like a flag, saying, “Hey, look what we can do with
synthesizers.” Torsten Schmidt I guess the most interesting thing about that Silicon Teens record is that
certain parts resurfaced later, on other records and are used more or less one-
on-one. Certain sequences, that kind of stuff. Gareth Jones Same musical sequences, lifted? Torsten Schmidt Yeah, but reused by the same people. Gareth Jones Part of what we were trying to do with Mute Records, well, what I was trying
to do, was to do experimental pop. We were trying to recreate new every time. That’s one of
the things I enjoyed about Matias this morning was that he was talking about
how much he enjoyed singing through. I bet he doesn’t use presets. I don’t
find that creative or helpful to take pre-made stuff and reuse it. Certainly, with Mute Records I always felt we were trying to go to our boundaries and make new stuff. Torsten Schmidt When did you actually get involved? The step from someone bringing a record
into the studio in Stoke Newington to actually getting involved with the people that
did it and actually working for them? Gareth Jones Well, John got Metamatic off the ground. Can I just talk about his business
model? Torsten Schmidt Absolutely. Gareth Jones He was very clever. Because he’d made three albums, he’d seen where the money
goes. You get an advance as an artist and it just gets burnt up in studio
bills, A&R, taxis, lunch dates,
flights. Suddenly it’s all gone. He seemed to make Metamatic the other way
around. He signed a publishing deal with a guy at Island Music called Richard Griffiths – also a bit of a
legendary music exec – and he used some of his publishing deal to make the
record. He was then able to sell the record for an album advance. So, even
though it wasn’t hugely successful in commercial terms, he was able to get ahead. He was a clever northerner. There’s a joke in Britain that northerners are a bit tight with
money. But he was clever with his money. He got ahead somehow; a lot of
artists in the ’80s just ended up owing the record company loads of money,
which is OK in the short term, can be fun, but in the long term isn’t the
greatest situation. He got ahead and decided to build a studio called the Garden, which is part of the Miloco Studio group in London now. It’s
in Shoreditch, and we went to Shoreditch in the really early ’80s when it was
really scummy, before it was remotely fashionable. The thing about it was it
was empty and cheap. John built a studio there in the basement. It was very
much his concept, and I, as his engineer at the time, gave him lots of advice
about what equipment we should buy. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life and
this is an example of one of the great mistakes I’ve made with equipment. One of the
most important things for us is to listen, OK? It’s very easy to bring lots of
pride and lots of prejudice to the table when there’s music being made. To me, that
gets in the way. It’s very important to listen. At this time in the early
’80s there was this attitude going around – I don’t know where I got it from;
in the mags, amongst the equipment dealers – this is a bit nerdy but the studio
people might get it – it’s that transformers were not a good thing. The way a transformer worked was to take the edge off the front of the beat. A kick or a
snare beat or a triangle has got a very steep edge at the front. Transformers
were considered to be softening this all down. So, there was this idea we
should have transformerless studios and that’s the studio we built in the
Garden. The initial version was an MCI JH-24, which was a
transformerless multi-track tape machine, and an AMEK 2520 console,
no transformers. Later, as I learned to listen more, it became clear that a
lot of the vintage gear we all love – any Tape Op reader knows this – it’s
about the sound of the transformer. The transformer imparts a wonderful
quality to sound, especially in the rock & roll world. So, this was a
prejudice – I brought a prejudice to the table. For some reason, I was
prejudiced against transformers because I wasn’t listening enough. Obviously,
the studio did loads of work and we made lots of hits. The studio itself made
lots of hits and I made some great records in there too. But still, that’s an
example of prejudice. Like the other thing – I’ve got lots of terrible, terrible examples
of pride in my life as well. One of them was when I was beginning as an
engineer and thought I knew everything. That’s ridiculous. In the medieval
times, pride is considered to be the worst of the seven deadly sins, because pride is a head
sin. Sins like lust and gluttony are not considered to be bad sins, because
that’s just the body taking over. We’ve all got bodies, what are we gonna do?
Pride is a mental state and, as such, is a very dangerous sin. [Stands up,
claps hands together] Thank you brethren [laughter]. Torsten Schmidt So, we deviated a little bit from you telling us about his business model. Gareth Jones Shall we pray? Sorry, Torsten. Torsten Schmidt We deviated a little from the business model. Gareth Jones Oh yeah, the Mute story. Torsten Schmidt No, no. Before we get to Mute, you wanted to enlighten us about John Foxx’s
business model. Gareth Jones That’s it, that’s the clever thing. Instead of getting behind and paying
someone else to rent a studio, we made a record called The Garden, which was
the name of the studio, still. So, John’s idea was to go, “OK, I want to go a
bit bigger now. I’ve done my minimal record, I need more tracks.” Rather than
spend the money renting a studio, we’ll build his studio – it was his money,
he hired me to help him do it. So, he built his studio, it was something a lot
of us do now. Obviously, we’ve all got our studios in our iPhones or laptops,
it’s kind of a normal model now. But at the time John took control – not to
use too political a term – of the means of production. He said, “OK, I need to
own the means of production, so I can creatively do what I need to do.”
Which is something a lot of you do anyway, I’m sure. So that was his business model and
it worked for him, I think. Seemed to be very clever at the time. Torsten Schmidt So obviously this guy, bringing in a physical record of something someone else
had taken, took care of his own means of production, like Daniel. Obviously,
something fitted there quite nicely. Gareth Jones Yeah, maybe that was part of the inspiration. When we made Metamatic, John
was renting a studio to make it in. But of course, “Warm Leatherette” is
blowing us away and that’s just made at home. That’s a bedroom record basically. One
of the first bedroom records, I would say. Torsten Schmidt Can you recall your first physical meeting with Daniel? Gareth Jones I do, because I had another prejudice. I’m going to talk about prejudice some
more. Depeche [Mode] were trying to make album number three.
Vince left after album one, which
was Speak and Spell. Then they
made the second album, which was Broken Frame, and then they got Alan Wilder involved and thought, “OK,
we need a new studio to work in.” John Foxx being an electronic musician, they
thought, “Let’s go and work in John Foxx’s studio,” because they didn’t like
rock & roll, it was electro-pop that Depeche were trying to make; were
making, defining… So ,they went to John Foxx’s studio. Now the thing about
Depeche Mode was they were on the radio. I didn’t think that was a very good place
to be, on the radio. They were a pop band and you could hear their stuff on
the radio. I didn’t think that was very cool, I was more interested in stuff
that wasn’t on the radio that much. I just thought, “It’s a pop band, I don’t
want to be involved.” So, they came to check out the studio and I said to John,
“I’m not doing the session, it’s a pop band, it’s not my thing, there’s no
point, I don’t get it, blah, blah, blah.” He said, “You’re making a mistake,
Gareth, it’s something you need to be involved in.” “Oh, fuck off, don’t boss
me about. I’m not doing it, basically.” So, they came to check the studio out for the weekend with another engineer who was there.
Because this has been one of my great creative and musical relationships with
Mute, they liked the studio, but they didn’t like the engineer that much. So, the
universe kindly gave me a second chance. They said to John, “We like the
studio, but we don’t really like that engineer. Do you know any other
engineers?” So, John came back to me and said, “Gareth, I’m
telling you, go over there and fucking meet them and see what happens.” So, I was, “Oh all right,
John, if I have to.” So, I went over to this tiny little office, Mute Records
at that time, and met – I’d been in Morocco for a month, on no budget, hanging out, smoking pot. I had on this Moroccan jacket and black nail
varnish and went over on this bicycle and I met this band and Daniel Miller in
the office of the record company. Torsten Schmidt They were on Top of the Pops already at this point, right? Gareth Jones Oh, yeah, even off Speak and Spell, “Just Can’t Get Enough” was a big hit. I suppose
that’s one of the things I didn’t like. Now I revere “Just Can’t Get Enough,” because it’s a classic piece of early electro-pop. But, at the time, it was just too
poppy for me. So, I met them, and funnily enough they seemed to be like normal
human beings, they seemed all right. They obviously thought I was all right,
because we decided… or they hired me, I suppose. “We decided” plays my role up
a bit too much really. But I thought, “Oh they’re all right, actually. They
might be doing pop music, but it’s not too bad. They seem all right and they're quite
nice. Daniel seems a bit weird,” I thought. “But there you go.” They probably
thought the same about me – “He seems a bit weird, but he’s all right.” So, we
started working together and we made Construction Time Again. Torsten Schmidt Which was recorded where? Gareth Jones In John’s studio, the Garden, which was the plan. It was recorded in
Shoreditch and mixed in Hansa Studios in
Berlin, where we were recently with Red Bull. Torsten Schmidt But before we get over to Hansa, I think this is the time to get the record
straight on a track you actually played in Hansa, on the actual desk where you
said it was recorded. But rumor has it a lot of the loops and stuff were
recorded in Shoreditch. Gareth Jones No, it was mixed on that desk, that was the story. Are you talking about
“Pipeline”? Torsten Schmidt Maybe it’s time to give you a bit of a breather and play a bit… Gareth Jones You want to play “Pipeline,” give them a break from my blabbing? (music: Depeche Mode – “Pipeline” / applause) Torsten Schmidt So, what are the synths that we’re not hearing on there? Gareth Jones This is early ’80s, sampling’s just been invented. Probably everyone here is a
bit young to know, but there was a time when samplers didn’t exist [laughter]. Torsten Schmidt There’s a reason why I cut off all this grey hair this morning. Gareth Jones That’s hard for you lot to understand, I know that. But there’s a
Mellotron in that
studio, that was the closest we got. Almost no one made their own Mellotron
tape loops, because you had to be incredibly wealthy. Keith Emerson did it, I think. But when samplers were invented, that was mind-blowing, because you could take sounds
like that [knocks glasses on water jug] and put them in the machine and play
beats and melodies with them. I know this is totally obvious, but I’m trying
to give you some idea of what that was like for us. That was incredible. Incredible! Suddenly everything changed. With tape, you could never get that
kind of response. It was very hard to change the key even if you changed the
tape. You could put stuff on tape before and hit “play” and the sound would
play. But it wasn’t like a sampler where you could change the note and make
complicated beats. So, this track is made all with samples. It’s quite well
documented this track, so I’ll make it brief. We went out into a scrapyard in
Shoreditch… disused railway lines. We went out with two tape recorders and
microphones, I had a beautiful analog reel-to-reel tape recorder,
Stellavox, beautiful
Swiss thing. We went all round this scrapyard for a couple of hours and
sampled all these sounds. Close mics and distant mics. You hear it on this
wonderful stereo [touches speaker] that Red Bull have set up for us. You can
hear the ambient sound and the close sound at the same time. Then we got back
to the studio with these sounds, and I realized I hadn’t got the tape recorder
switched on right, which was a bit embarrassing, so they all sounded shit. So
we had to go out again and do it all again. But we were very motivated by this
idea of constructing a track by using found sound. It’s readymade, it’s
Marcel Duchamp in sound. There you go, every sound, we found it, and then we’ve used it to play beats and
melodies. We were lucky with the scrapyard. There’s this really interesting
article out now with Matthew Herbert in Tape Op or Sound on Sound
about how he made a record from a pig. He sampled the pig. All the sounds are
from the pig, from the moment of its birth right up to the moment of being
eaten. I haven’t heard the record but the concept is wonderful. He said one of
the things he finds quite hard with found sound is getting any sense of pitch.
Funnily enough, when I was using samplers then we found lots of sounds with pitch. [Knocks
on table] There’s pitch. [Knocks on speaker] There’s even pitch in the
speakers – there shouldn’t be really. In a scrapyard, there’s lots of sounds
with pitch, bell sounds, metal sounds. So, after I’d admitted my mistake and
apologized, we went back out and sampled everything again. We came back and we mixed the close
and distant sound into these very primitive early samplers that we had that would play
only one sound at a time. Most of the time we couldn’t store the sounds
either, so it would be played, recorded onto tape, then the sampler would be
emptied, then we’d put a new sound in. The whole track is made with sampled
sounds. Incidentally, with no EQ or reverb. When we got to Berlin and mixed
this track, we’d spent so much work on the other mixes and compression and EQ
and everything that I was just totally burnt out. We put this one up on the
faders and it just sounded great. So, I suggested as a concept we mixed it
without any reverb or compression or EQ, and we did, and that’s the track. So,
found sound in its natural state. Torsten Schmidt I guess we’re gonna talk about found sounds more in a bit, but you mentioned
Berlin and you were there already on a couple of other jobs in different
functions. (music: DÖF – “Codo”) Torsten Schmidt We’ll spare you the chorus, but if you were anywhere in Central Europe around 1983 and
in the second grade, that was the joint. There was no bumper car without that.
That went multi-platinum, right? Gareth Jones I mixed this record. It was co-written and produced by a friend of mine. Is my
mic still on? There’s a couple of things I want to say about that. It sounds a
bit boomy, doesn’t it? I mixed it, so sorry about that. Still, it was six
weeks at No 1 in Germany, totally multi-platinum. I have an interesting
relationship with a lot of the stuff I mix. A lot of the time, even now, I struggle, like I
suppose we all do, but it sounds really shit to me, a lot of the stuff I mix.
I do it and do the best I can and think, “Oh God, it doesn’t sound very good.”
And then I come back to it in a couple of weeks – and this is not an example,
this doesn’t sound that great, I admit – and then it’s OK. Torsten Schmidt It sounded a lot better and bigger on the bumper car than anything else that
was out at the time. Gareth Jones It sounds great on small speakers, yeah. A lot of the time I was working on
NS-10s and
tiny little speakers because radio was massively important. But I just wanted
to throw that in as a bit of an insight. I’ve noticed it again recently, I’m
working on three records at the moment, so I’m going in between them. I went
back to a record that’s just been mastered at Air, it’s just been delivered to
me. I was delivering the masters to Air and I thought, “Oh, this record sounds
all right, I’ve done all right, I haven’t done such a bad job after all.” Up
until then I thought I was failing. I guess I’m a bit hypercritical of myself,
which means without a deadline I’d never get anything finished. Deadlines
really help me. Because I’m not confident in my own work, without a deadline
I still would never deliver anything. I’d still be working on Metamatic. Torsten Schmidt So, Friday two o’clock, that’s for you lot. Gareth Jones When I was younger, I was scared of deadlines, I used to experience them as a
lot of stress. It was, “God, we’ve got to get it finished by Friday at two,
what a nightmare.” But now I really love the deadlines, because I know that
without I wouldn’t get it finished. So, anyway, do you want to go back
chronologically on this? Torsten Schmidt A little bit, but on that one, I’m surprised the whole hook-up was through
Klaus Schulze’s camp and there was
a line there, which looking back is really interesting. Gareth Jones With... [points to laptop] Torsten Schmidt With Döf. Gareth Jones No, there’s no Klaus Schulze connection, unless you know better than I do. Torsten Schmidt I was just going by the file. Gareth Jones A bit of prejudice again. I was hired to co-produce a record for a Neue Deutsche Welle band called
Ideal, who were big.
Annette Humpe went on from this
band to become one of Germany’s top producers. She still is, she does this
band Ich + Ich, if anyone’s into
Germany’s pop scene. She’s very talented anyway, massive. And we went to
Vienna to record this band Ideal, their third album. I wanted to go back to
the Garden Studio in London and mix it because I was insecure. The manager
said, “Can we go and have a look at this studio in Berlin? Maybe it’ll be a
cool place to mix for you.” Obviously, it suited him, but I was like, “I’ll have a
look, but I really want to go back to London to somewhere I know.” He took me to
Hansa Studios’ penthouse mixing suite in the ’80s – it was incredible, like a state-
of-the-art mixing room with a Solid State Logic console in it. At that time
I’d never worked on a Solid State Logic
Console, and it was bit of a dream for all the young engineers and producers.
It was like the thing. It’s not so important now, I don’t think, because
we all know it’s all about the music not the technology. But he showed me this
and I mixed the record there and then, we mixed this record [points to laptop] there
as well. When I was mixing this record there, Daniel Miller was there with
the Birthday Party,
it’s a big multi-studio complex, Hansa in Berlin. He was with the Birthday
Party downstairs and I said, “Hey man, come and look at this mixer. Maybe we
can do Depeche Mode here.” He looked at it and liked the vibe as well, so
that’s how we finished up doing these three Berlin-period Depeche Mode albums,
all mixed in Hansa Studios in Berlin. Torsten Schmidt Before we go to the studio as a space – and I guess we should hear an example
of what it sounds like beforehand – you were such a young engineer and now
you’re being called in to mix a band who’ve had hits, are multi-platinum like
Ideal, “Monotonie” and “Blaue Augen.” I think the only one that
did all right off the album you did was “Meine Heimat.” Gareth Jones Yeah, when I did the Bi Nuu album, the band were essentially splitting up. They split
up afterwards. There was a lot of internal tension in the band. A lot of bands
don’t realize how good they are together, so then you get these power
struggles. I don’t know if that happened in Ideal, maybe it did. So, they were
splitting up, and that’s perhaps reflected in the lack of success of the album. Torsten Schmidt What did you learn from these processes? Obviously, you’re there pouring your heart
into it while these guys are off to Dschungel and other clubs partying it out while you’re
there trying to make some sense of the session you did all day. Gareth Jones What, with Ideal? Torsten Schmidt Oh no, just in general. There’s the band and there’s your job. You’re putting
in at least the same amount of effort and long hours, but you can only work
with what you get off the band. Gareth Jones It depends on what kind of producer you are, doesn’t it? Some producers are
great songwriters. I’m not a great songwriter. This is a whole day’s
discussion anyway – what is a producer’s job? They’re all so different. I know
some producers, like Paul Epworth, this wonderful young London producer, is a
great songwriter himself and he co-writes with the artist. So, he does more
than take what the band offer. Annette Humpe is a great songwriter as well. So
these people write with the bands. You don’t work with them if you’re not
prepared to co-write. They figure that when they co-write, they raise the level of
the band. But when I worked with Depeche Mode, with Martin Gore largely
songwriting, there was no need for extra songwriting input anyway. So, it was a
good match because Martin’s a wonderful songwriter. Torsten Schmidt The next record is what you’d call a game-changer. You were quoted at the time
about understanding how a pop song works. You were quoted saying, “If I’d been
a more experienced engineer, I would’ve paid more attention to the little ear-
opening monitor system and also paid more attention to the big monitors, because the
boundaries of the sound are, well… crude. Still, having said that, the tracks
have incredible energy and, coming out of a radio or a little television set, it
was like the radio was going to explode. That’s why it was a massive hit all
over Europe. So, overall I’m incredibly pleased and proud of that work.” There
you go… (music: wrong track) (music: Depeche Mode – “People Are People” / applause) Gareth Jones I’m clapping as well, because it’s all about the artist in my work as a mixing
engineer. If an artist comes to you with a great song and a great idea, you’ve
got to be a real dick to fuck it up, basically [laughter]. And I’ve been
lucky that I’ve worked with some super-talented artists, and if you’re really
careful it turns out great. So, that’s why I’m clapping along with you guys. I
hope I survive this week. It’s a bit like having your life flash before your
eyes, this little chat with Torsten. It’s like one thing after the other from
the past. Torsten Schmidt Can you share a couple of images that are just flashing before your eyes right
now before we go into specifics? Gareth Jones No, not really. Torsten Schmidt I always wonder what these 5.1 mixes are about, like who really needs them?
But in the 5.1 edition of this one, there’s a really great documentary that
shows a lot of really insightful things. Gareth Jones Yeah, yeah. Torsten Schmidt Different hairstyles. Gareth Jones Different clothes, different hairstyles. But because I was in love with
classical music before I discovered other music, the sense of space that music
takes place in has always been important to me. The fact that a musical experience that
exists in an acoustic space has always been really important to me. With this
record, and other records I made in the ’80s, it was lucky because it fits in
with the fashion, the taste of the time. It was OK to put lots of reverb on
vocals, that’s what I’m saying. But in this work there’s loads of acoustic
space on all the synthesizers and, in that sense, part of what we were doing
seemed to be groundbreaking, because, up until then, synthesizers were all
plugged into a mixing desk directly and recorded onto tape, and then only a bit
of reverb added later in the mix. But what we were doing with Depeche and
others in the ’80s was putting synthesizers through guitar amps or big PAs,
mic-ing up the sound of the room, mic-ing the amp up close, mic-ing the amp up a
long way away, and in that sense it ties into the acoustic spaces on
“Pipeline,” the sample piece we played before. It’s always been a great
fascination for me and that’s why it’s been a pleasure and a privilege and I
had so much fun working with this band because our interests went along in
parallel very comfortably for a few albums. Torsten Schmidt To a certain degree, that’s what everyone who uses Logic or Pro Tools would say
as well. But you were doing the actual physical action right there at Hansa. Could you
take us along a virtual walk-through of the building, how you used the
different levels of the building to record this stuff? Gareth Jones A lot of the sound of this song is put together in the mix. There’s still a
lot of it on tape. Torsten Schmidt It started on Walkman to start with, that’s the rumor. Gareth Jones This choir thing, the “help me understand” bit in the bridge, you hear a
little choir. It’s like an ambient noise off a plane. It started… Martin got a gift
from God and wrote the song, basically that’s where it started. But one of the things he
did on the demo was record some airplane cabin noise, which I’m obviously not
allowed to say which airplane it was, otherwise there’ll be terrible struggles
among the lawyers. Rumor has it, allegedly. But we tried to reconstruct that
sample for a long time. This was an early example of learning how magic
samples are, which is obviously something if you guys are using samples to create your
own music, or loops, taken from other records, it’s extremely difficult to
replace a sample. And this was a self-made sample, obviously, but it got
incorporated into the end production. When we mixed it, there’s a huge concert
hall in Hansa, which is a wonderfully atmospheric rock & roll studio. When
we did this, we were mixing upstairs on floor four, and on floor one there’s a
three-story-high, huge room and I put a big PA in there to use the room as an
echo chamber. I had another big tiled room used as an echo chamber as well. So
different elements of the beats and the drums were going around the room; like
you’d put them in three different plug-ins now, then you’d put them in three
different physical spaces. It took us a number of days to mix this, the whole
studio was pumping for days with this huge PA. The kick drum is going into Hansa Two
downstairs, the snare drum is going into another room. Basically, we’re having
a lot of fun with wires and drums and amplifiers and mics. Torsten Schmidt It’s something to really physically imagine, because now it’s a matter of
three clicks on a track pad. But to physically take a drill, make sure the
cable is going three floors down, finding the right amp and just the whole
matter of… how did you talk to your assistant who was mic-ing the amplifier
down there when you were listening? Gareth Jones It’s all about loads of cables going down. I could talk through the PA or
through headphones. It’s normal studio practice; you’ve got two-way feedback. You need to be able to communicate, obviously. It’s just fun building systems.
I’d like to be able do a synthesizer record where it’s kind of written, we’ve
chosen the synth sounds, possibly even recorded them, then have a nice big room like
this [walks around], then put the bass amp here and play the Moog through a
nice big bass amp, then mic it up. Then maybe over here have another couple of
amps with sequencers going through them, over there have drum amps. To
reconstruct the whole sound of the record inside a room and record it all at
once; that’s something that’s done in layers in this period and it’s something
I’ve wanted to do for a long time to create that for real, a bit of fun.
Obviously, I’m a huge Kraftwerk fan and I’d like to have in one room all the
electronics playing at once, to capture the sound of that room. Torsten Schmidt Obviously, that sounds like a humongous amount of fun, but how much of that is
actually audible to the listener in the end? Gareth Jones Like Matias said this morning, having fun is what it’s all about. It is play,
what I do. My mother, she’s 89 years old, she said to me recently, “You don’t
really work, do you dear? You just play about all the time.” You know, guilty!
It is play, and playing needs a sense of fun. Like Matias, Matias works in the
way he does because it’s fun for him. When you’re having fun, you flow more.
When you’re not having fun it’s easy to get stuck. “Oh, it’s difficult, I’m
stuck, I don’t know what to do, I’m fucked.” When you’re having fun, it’s like
scree-running or snowboarding or something, you flow, and that has incredible
knock-on effects into the work. Torsten Schmidt That’s one of the most suave transgressions to the next topic. We’ve been
talking about the drums, the machines, the sequencers, but you have to somehow
marry that voice, the human element, to all the machinery that’s going on.
Therefore, you need to make that person feel comfortable. What techniques did you
learn to make that fragile person on the other side of the booth feel comfy? Gareth Jones Recording anything is a life’s work. Recording drums is a life’s work, a
drum kit… every time I do it is an amazing little adventure. Recording
vocalists similarly could be a life’s work. I used to make a lot of fuss – I’d
prepare everything, make it really nice, get a bunch of waters, make sure they have water, tidy the carpet, a little stand for their lyrics, a pen, an ashtray, whatever they needed. I did that
for a long time, and it seemed to work quite well. Then I stopped fussing. As I’ve
got older, I just put the mic up. That’s how I record vocals, I put the mic up
and just do it, and that works really well. Torsten Schmidt It’s always great when you see a hip-hop artist in the studio. The sound they
have in the can when they get the playback after they drop their 16 bars or
whatever, if it’s just run through a very simple compressor. They’re in there,
obviously all “the man” when they walk in, they listen to it, concentrate when
they lay down their rhyme, then they hear themselves back and you can see it
on the other side of the window. Like, “I must sound like Biggie right now.” You can
see it, just the little effect a compressor does gives them so much more
confidence that the next take is usually so much better straight away. Are there simple
techniques like that? How do you get the sound for them right? Does it need to
sound different for what you use? Gareth Jones Yeah, of course. To me, when I’m recording artists, I like to do it as quickly and easily as possible. Obviously, I’ve got quite a lot of experience now, so I figure I
can make some things work pretty easily and quickly. But that’s what it’s all about.
Of course, they get compression and two effects, whatever they need. But it’s really
about saying, “OK, you wanna do a vocal? Let’s go.” It’s about being ready for
that. Not, “Let’s go. OK, I need to set this up and set this up and then do
this and just get you a headphone mix.” That’s bollocks to me. When I work
with engineers now, I don’t like that. I want people to be super-fast. When I’m
working with bands often, we hire an engineer, but everything’s got to be super-fast because I get really bored really quickly. I figure if I get bored, the
band’s going to get bored, and everyone gets bored and then you might as well just stop because we’re not
trying to do anything boring. So, it’s all got to happen super-quickly. Everyone has to find their own route. There is no simple thing. Sure, the
headphones need to sound wonderful, but they don’t need to sound wonderful if
you say, “Can we do a vocal?” and then you take half an hour making them
sound wonderful. A lot of the time, it’s great to just do the vocals, like everyone
works in bedroom studios. I like doing them like that, just demo where
everyone’s sitting there. I mixed a record recently, not out yet, for a band
called David’s Liar, a London band, young, debut album. Wonderful record in my
opinion. On the demo of this song, the chorus is sung in half-time. I didn’t know, but when
we got to the mix the artist said, “On the demo, I’m not sure.” So, one of the
managers was very into the music, he said, “Check the demo.” It was half-time
and we hadn’t got it half-time anywhere in the Pro Tools section, so I just
put the mic up and he just sang it in the control room with the speakers on,
just there. And he got it, and it works. It’s on the album and it sounds
fantastic. To me that’s what capturing live performance is about. You
capture it before you know. You don’t make a lot of fuss preparing the magic.
You just go, “Hey, that was magic, we just made magic.” You don’t go, “Watch
this. I’m going to make some magic, OK? I’ll just tidy up first and get a good
headphone mix.” You don’t do it like that. You just do it, bang! Then everyone goes, “What the fuck just
happened?” So, it’s all about flow… it’s flow. Torsten Schmidt At the same time, in the digital realm, we sometimes come across a lot of
multi-tracks and the multi-tracks of classic recordings. Let’s not use your
example, but let’s say a Queen record, a Stevie record or whatever. Let’s say
you’ve got a 16- or 24-track Queen record that you think you know inside out,
and all of a sudden you see it in front of you and it’s like a giant jigsaw
puzzle. “Hang on Brian, there’s a bit of cheating going on here. That riff is
comped from nine different takes,” and all that kind of stuff. Now, I take it
that process was a bit different when you didn’t have all that stuff on one
screen. Gareth Jones I made friends a long time ago – before the internet, actually. I know that’s
hard for you to imagine, there was a time when there was no internet – but we
had a bulletin board system going and I met a guy called Bob Ohlson, who was a mastering engineer at Motown,
just one of the many wonderful things he’s done. And he spoke about when they
made Diana Ross records, they recorded the backing track straight to stereo.
Then Miss Ross comes in and does the vocals afterwards; they would still play the
backing track, and she would have about six goes at the vocal. Each time it would be
recorded onto a new stereo tape, mixed in, sound on sound or whatever you want
to call it. And then the producer and the engineer would sit and choose the
best bits of Miss Ross’s performance and cut it together, comp the vocal, even
before multi-track. People have done comping forever. As soon as we got tape, “Oh look, we can cut tape.” Editing is not something…
DAWs have not given us the ability to edit. Anyone can cut tape with a razor blade. It’s easy and it’s
fun. With multitrack tape, we did lots of comping and you tried to plan the
session so you wouldn’t leave the lead vocal until last, because the tape might
be full then and you can only do one track. So, you’d try to do the lead vocal
when you still had six tracks, so you’d do five for the vocal and then pick
the best bits and mix them down onto the other track. So, on some of my old
multi-tracks, when I look at them, it’s still 24 tracks across the screen. But
of course, everything doesn’t play everywhere. So, some tracks have five
different riffs on them or something. Torsten Schmidt I’m still trying to imagine how you organize such a mixing session in the end.
Let’s say eight vocal takes and you’re trying to turn them into one. Gareth Jones But that’s organized before the mix. Torsten Schmidt Take us through the organization, getting something ready for that. Gareth Jones Obviously, you’ve got the vocal takes and then you choose them shortly after
the vocal’s done usually. I think it’s really good before you do the editing.
I used to put the editing off, because it can be a bit boring, not as much fun
as recording. But I think it’s quite good if you do some recording, then you do the
editing quite quickly after the recording because everyone’s still in the vibe
of what you were trying to achieve. And you commit. Commitment in recording is
really wonderful. It’s one of the big nightmares we’ve got with the
multitracks now on Pro Tools rigs. I get a lot of stuff to mix where the
guitar, say, is recorded on six mics. Six mics is cool, but what you want to
do is mix the mics together to make a guitar sound. Fantastic, you’ve made a
guitar sound, you’ve made a creative commitment. That’s good for you and it’s good
for me when I come to mix it, because I know what you want to do. You know what
you’re trying to do and you know if it works. So many multitracks I get at the
moment… I’m mixing a record at the moment and the vocal is recorded on three
mics. I get three tracks of the same vocal. It’s the same take, but over three tracks, so every song
I’ve got to say, “Does the
Ribbon sound better than the
U-47 or does the U-87 sound better?
Could they be better in this mix or that mix?” It’s a fucking nightmare. But
the clients delivered it like that, I’m not complaining. The clients are very nice people,
I like the music, it’s all cool. But I do much better work when I commit to
things. You must all know this. If you commit to something, then it’s
really good. And if it’s no good later, wipe it off and do it again. That’s
one of the wonderful things about working on tape – I don’t work on tape
any more, I can’t really afford it – but it’s not so much the sonic quality,
it’s the psychology of doing it. If you’re working on tape, and you want to
record a guitar solo and it’s the end of the session, there’s a guitar solo
and it’s on one track. Then the guitarist might say, “This is not good enough,
I want to re-record it.” In order to re-record it,
they’ve got to wipe off the solo they recorded already. That’s unthinkable in
Pro Tools world. None of you would do that, none of you would have the balls,
probably. I don’t think I’ve got the balls, and I know the advantages. Every
one keeps the old take first. I know the take’s being kept, the engineer knows
it’s being kept, the guitarist knows the take has been kept. That’s a
completely different psychology from when the guitarist says, “You know what?
That solo’s no good, wipe it off, I’m going to play a new one.” That’s really different,
that’s like scoring a goal in high-level football. That’s not pussying about
rehearsing. It’s not a practice match. That’s the real deal: Wipe it off, I’m
going to play it again. When someone says that, that’s like, “OK, man,
respect.” Not just, “Could you just mute that one and I’ll have another go?”
Commitment is really important. It’s really hard to do with computers, really, really
hard. Everyone keeps it. I keep it. I know what a great method this is. Even
if I wipe it off in the session, I know I’ve got three back-ups, one in the
cloud and two in the site. It’s never gone. On tape it was gone. That lead
vocal is no good. The tape’s full, 24 tracks, full. “You know what? The lead
vocal’s not very good, is it? I think I’ll do it again.” Whoa! Great, really great.
We may never get back there. We may never get back there. The data is never gone
now, even if you wipe it off. Torsten Schmidt The interesting thing is that you’re talking about a time when that particular band you were recording showed millions of people around the world, that probably aren’t old
enough to know the work of the Tom Moultons and so on, that a track
that they know inside out is never finished and someone else can have a go at
it and do a new mix of it, a remix. As an example, I’d like to follow up with
something from a guy that you worked with as well, and off the same track, just
to give us an idea of how different these things can be. (music: “People Are People (On-U Sound Mix)”) Gareth Jones That’s Adrian Sherwood, it’s “Are People People,” the Science Fiction
Dancehall Classic mix he did. If any of you guys ever get the chance to remix
for record companies, don’t do that because there’s no vocals. You just get it
straight back and they go, “Very cool backing track, but where’s the
vocals?” At the time that wasn’t important, we had extended versions with
vocals, blah, blah, blah. Adrian Sherwood’s a great genius, a great inspiration for me as well. Torsten Schmidt In what sense? Gareth Jones Because he’s so crazy, so out there, so dedicated, self-made, runs his own
label, like Matias does. He’s always been on the edge and he’s totally committed to his
vision and what he does, a real no-sell-out dude. Just a wonderfully charming,
sweet person… can be bitter sometimes, but never with me. Torsten Schmidt All bitter people are failed romantics. Gareth Jones He’s a wonderful guy. I met him in Lodz last year again. So that’s one of his incredible crazy remixes. Torsten Schmidt How many of the bits in there can you actually recognize and identify? Gareth Jones About three. I think it’s been made from the beats. It’s made from the
multitrack without a sampler. Oh no, that’s not true, he’s using an AMS old-
style studio sampler and reconstructing the multitrack on another reel of
tape, probably. But he’s not bringing any new sounds in. It’s an authentic and
honorable remix, because he’s taking all the sounds off the multitrack and
reorganizing them and putting them back on another multitrack. There’s no
outside sound brought on there. But, as we hear, there’s a lot left off, like
the melody and the lead vocal. Torsten Schmidt And you turn around, oh my God! At the time you worked with another seminal
band called Einstürzende Neubauten. If we were to
play “Yu-Gung”, would you go for a Sherwood mix or a live version that’s a
little later? Because it’s not easy to find the actual… Gareth Jones What’s wrong with my mix? Torsten Schmidt It wasn’t out there to find. Gareth Jones Play some of Adrian’s mix. Torsten Schmidt You got it on there or not? Gareth Jones Probably not, play some of Adrian’s mix. (music: Einstürzende Neubauten – “Yu-Gung (Adrian Sherwood mix)”) Torsten Schmidt Can you enlighten us a bit about what was so special about the studio
techniques and especially what FM Einheit applied in the studios? Gareth Jones This is a track called “Yu-Gung.” This is made with an analog sequencer that I
had, a more sophisticated version, in a way, perhaps not quite so user-
friendly… made by Friendship, a Berlin company, for Tangerine Dream. It was more
sophisticated but as not as user-friendly as that wonderful Arp 16-step
sequencer. But this is constructed with a sequencer and a sampler. This is the
first time Neubauten used sequencers and samples, because obviously I was a big
fan of what they were doing. Obviously, very powerful lyrics, the great lunatic genius
Blixa Bargeld on front of it. We
hear clearly sequencers and samplers are being used, which I’m bringing in.
Mufti, Herr Einheit, got that
really quick. Of all of the band he embraced it immediately. He seemed like
almost the most animalistic of the band in certain ways. Mufti saw it and
grabbed it, ran with it. Obviously, everyone uses samplers and sequencers now,
but that was part of the story of how that track was put together. Torsten Schmidt You’d worked with them before this, right? Gareth Jones This was early in my work with them. Halber Mensch is the album I made. But isn’t this made before Halber Mensch? I’m not sure. Torsten Schmidt In a land before time. But at the same time, in that land before time, when
you saw them perform, it wasn’t exactly like a Depeche Mode PA where you had
drumulators and big pads and stuff. Gareth Jones No, I never saw them perform with samplers or sequencers. I saw them perform
as playing metal and found objects and bass and guitar, of course. I saw them
playing it live. As a producer, it’s really important to see bands play live
before you record them, and as a recording engineer, even. I know everyone
here’s got different backgrounds and interests. When I was putting my first
10,000 hours in, trying to learn my skills, I spent a lot of time in the
studio and not enough time at gigs. Actually I didn’t spend enough time in art
galleries, I didn’t spend enough time walking in the mountains, I didn’t spend
enough time doing anything other than sitting in a studio making recordings.
That made it a bit too narrow, so I don’t even know if I saw Neubauten perform
before I worked with them in the studio. Now it would be obvious that I would
see them at least once, twice, three times before I did a recording with them, because you get such a wonderful feel for what a band is about when you see them live. Torsten Schmidt But you got some sort of performance in the studio when they brought in a
whole bunch of beer kegs and all that sort of stuff. Gareth Jones They did the most wonderful art installation in Hansa Studio Two with
incredible sheets of metal and scaffolding, a huge room full of found objects
and springs and boxes. Incredible installation they did when we made Halber
Mensch. Torsten Schmidt So, if you have a bunch of beer kegs… Gareth Jones I don’t remember beer kegs, but anyway… Torsten Schmidt If you have a bunch of construction scaffolding and all that stuff, do you need to mic that differently from your average vintage snare drum? Gareth Jones I don’t know, there’s no rules. Obviously, there’s no rules about making
recordings other than – it’s a cliché – but if it sounds right, it is right. I
had some contact mics at the time. I was using tape-on contact mics as well as
close mics and distant mics. The recording of Neubauten was about capturing
the sound and energy of a live performance and in that sense, maybe it’s not
that different from recording a really vibrant and exciting rock band – bass,
drums, guitar. Torsten Schmidt Now, at exactly this time you recorded one of the most successful records on
the planet. You’re getting calls for different jobs that might sound a little different. (music: Bronski Beat – “Hit That Perfect Beat”) Gareth Jones I didn’t record this, I mixed this, in Hansa. I can’t remember the producer’s
name, I only worked with him on this project. He was a really nice guy and I
guess they came to Hansa and me because of Depeche. That’s that, two weeks in
the Hansa mix room mixing that album. Torsten Schmidt When you’re all of a sudden in demand, how do you choose your projects then? Gareth Jones I didn’t have a plan. For better or worse, I just went with the flow. I had no
plan, I didn’t really have management help. Now, I have managers in Europe and
America who I can talk things through with, decide which projects we want to
do, which we haven’t got time to do, which projects I fit with. I try to do
projects I feel I can contribute something to. Bronski Beat must have been one
of those things. They got in touch, and it seemed like a good fit so we just
went with it. Torsten Schmidt Before all these digital serendipity engines, when you’re trying to find out,
“I like this music, that music, what else is out there?,” you always needed a
good record shop person, or yeah, just to look at credits and realize, “Oh, that
arranger does something I like, maybe other records by the same guy do
something.” And that’s how a lot of people stumbled across this thing here. (music: Nitzer Ebb – “Let Your Body Learn” / applause) Gareth Jones We’re a bit behind in the chronology. It’s nearly five o’clock and it’s only 1987, 20
years ago. Feeling like I’m stuck in the ’80s. Torsten Schmidt We better hurry up. We’re leaving the ’80s in a second, but obviously tracks
like that were totally seminal for an emerging scene in Chicago and Detroit
and they would be playing stuff like that like mad. Gareth Jones Yeah, Nitzer Ebb. I mixed this record with Daniel Miller, very record-company-led. I’d opened a bit of a relationship with Mute Records, it’s a wonderful
powerhouse of experimental pop and a great fit for me. In spite of the fact
they were making very successful pop records, there was enormous creative
freedom, a lot of record sales, and there was budget. So, it was an incredible
privilege and a pleasure to be part of all this. This was one of the records
Daniel wanted to release and he asked me to mix it. The band came over to
Berlin as well and I had a great time meeting them, just a couple of days. We
only did one 12", just a couple of tracks. It was very much led by the
vision, the A&R strengths and personality which is Daniel Miller. Torsten Schmidt How much of the club experience would go into the production and mixing? Gareth Jones I’ve never been a big clubber. Not from me, not much at all. Obviously, from the band, I guess, and I like working with people. I do some mixing now where I’m just alone in a
room. That’s OK, I like the work and I’ve done some very satisfying mixes for
me and the client like that. But, obviously, it’s really good fun. A lot of
people start making music because they like being in a room with a bunch of
people making a noise and I’ve always enjoyed that in studios as well. In a record
like that, obviously the band are there and if it’s not hard enough
[laughs]... With them, if it’s too soft you hear about it really quickly.
“That’s no good. The bass drum needs to be much harder.” Torsten Schmidt Was that the language being used? Gareth Jones I don’t know, but I imagine that was also being led by the vision of the
artist who’s there. Although Daniel has a clear vision, too. Torsten Schmidt The interesting thing is a lot of people getting into that were coming from
heavy metal. They were getting bored with the way metal was going. They
gravitated towards that because there was a certain aggressiveness, but also, in
a bizarre way, a certain funkiness as well. Only much later, when you see
footage of sweaty clubs with loads of big men and large bottles of poppers,
[you realize] that there’s a very non-heavy metal energy going on there. How
conscious were they of appealing to different clienteles? Gareth Jones My experience of those times – and bear in mind I was a studio animal and very
focused on that world – was that this was artists expressing themselves and
finding their audience. None of the work I did with Mute was aimed at a
specific target audience. This is not corporate pop, this is not X Factor,
it’s not, “Hey, if we get a black girl, a white girl and a Chinese girl and put
them together with a heavy metal guitarist...” Torsten Schmidt “…we’ve got all bases covered.” Gareth Jones Obviously, it’s not like that, it doesn’t feel like that. It wasn’t made like
that at the time. There was of course a real push and a wish – Depeche Mode and
Erasure wanted to be successful electronic pop bands. There was a real sense
in which they were making music for the world. But, I guess, as bands develop
they find out what their audience is. But a lot of bands, as they grow, they
lose their audience, don’t they? I’ve had that in my work as a producer and you
guys must have had it as musicians. You start off, you make some music and
you’ve got three mates who like what you do. Then you make a new track and then
maybe 56 mates like it, but then the three original mates think you’ve already
sold out. So, the three mates who were there at the beginning go, “The early
music by you, that was good, back in the day…” That happens all the way down. I’ve seen that happen with artists who’ve grown. The art of being a hugely
successful band, like U2 or Coldplay, is to keep respect. I have a huge
respect for the fans of the music that I’ve worked with because the fans are
what keep it going. The fans buy the music, they support the acts and without
them we’re all back to the bedrooms playing cassettes to each other. One other
thing about that, I realized recently again, every record I’ve ever made is
someone’s favorite record. Not just the successful records. Every piece you
put out there is probably someone’s favorite piece ever. I find that helpful
because it gives you enormous respect for the work. Even if it’s not your
favorite piece ever, it probably will be someone’s favorite piece of music ever. It’ll be a piece of music that accompanies them through life experience, a marriage, a death, a birth, a love affair, a broken love affair, something where it’ll be really, really, really,
really important to them. And that makes every piece of music really important
because to someone it’s the most important piece ever. Just thought
I’d throw that in. Torsten Schmidt Using Depeche Mode as an example, you felt the other side of that here: The
incredible burden when you work with them. You work with them on Construction Time Again, on Some Great Reward, on Black Celebration and then a
couple of years later on Ultra and Exciter. Obviously,
they’ve been through about five different periods in that time and you’ve got
this mass of dedicated fanatics around the world that are just crushing these four people
with their expectations. What did you learn from the process of trying to deal
with that? Gareth Jones I don’t know if the fans crush the artists. It’s difficult, being mega-successful. Not me, obviously, I’m just some backroom dude. But for the stars
at the front, it’s obviously difficult, especially when you’re young. Young guys,
loads of money, loads of success can be a total disaster. Football, you see it
all the time; rock music, you see it all the time. Growing up in public is
difficult. Torsten Schmidt You could be working in the mines. Gareth Jones It beats working in the jam factory. In my experience Depeche felt a big
responsibility for the fans. I don’t think they felt crushed by them, perhaps
they did. No one has the same feeling for a long time, for 25 years. Torsten Schmidt When you’re in a session and you need to make it work, you need to facilitate
that somehow. Gareth Jones We all feel we’ve got a responsibility for the fans, we all feel that. But we’ve also got a responsibility to ourselves to do something that is somehow worthwhile and original. Torsten Schmidt But you are, to a certain degree, in a more comfortable position. When you go
down to the milkman and go buy your yogurt, no one’s going to say, “Oh no, Gareth fell off.” People wouldn’t even recognize you; still it’s your job to make them look good. Gareth Jones It’s my job to help. It’s Anton Corbijn’s job to make them look
good. It’s my job to help. I see myself as one of many supportive elements
around a band. It’s not as big as a movie, making a record. But a successful
record is a huge team of people, clearly. I’m not making it happen, I’m helping a bit from my corner. Torsten Schmidt So if we consider this team-player effort, if I just look at the year after
Black Celebration. I just
picked highlights of that year: it’s Nick Cave, House of Love, Erasure, The Rainbirds. That’s four very different
projects in one year, four very different teams. That’s like going from
Arsenal to Kaiserslautern to Perugia to Barcelona in one season. Gareth Jones You know your football, I don’t. Torsten Schmidt I don’t go there, but it’s very different approaches in the same time. Gareth Jones But not nearly as broad as the music I enjoy listening to. There’s no string
quartets in there, no be-bop, no solo piano. There’s loads of music. It’s kind
of broad in a way, but it’s a small angle. Torsten Schmidt Still you’re recording piano pieces for Irmin Schmidt who came from a very
different background as well. And you’re doing film stuff with Wim Wenders. All that stuff, totally
different work. Gareth Jones Yeah, that’s different, but super fun. Like Matias said this morning, he
listens to loads of music. I listen to loads of different kinds of music all the time. A lot of
music you listen to, I probably don’t know and I’m sure I’m going to get loads
out of this week by hearing some of what you guys are making and listening to,
always, because music’s so huge. But I listen to lots of beats and melodies.
It’s a long history. We’ve got 25,000 years of human endeavor. Torsten Schmidt As Gareth says, he’s going to be here all week, and will share time in the
studios and he’s also willing to help you mix and follow through with some of
the stuff you’re creating here. I understand he’s also brought some multitracks
for which we can probably find a nice little room at some stage and go through various bits and dissect them a little bit. Obviously, there are tons and tons of stories
to be shared, from Interpol to
Palais Schaumberg,
all the individual projects of the Palais Schaumberg guys, like the
Hillers, Fehlmann’s and so on. But
before we hand it over to the questions there’s another album that people tend
to like a bit, which you got called on as well, and I’d like to play some of
that. (music: Mogwai – “Batcat”) Torsten Schmidt As our man from Scotland would be saying, “Regards, thank you very much.” Now,
when you go over and listen to those recordings you’ve done, sometimes three,
sometimes 25 years ago, what do you actually listen for? Gareth Jones When I go over there? [Points forwards to other part of the room] It’s just a bit muffled over here, so over there I get a bit more of the vibe of the whole thing. Just enjoying
most of them, you can hear it better. Torsten Schmidt That’s good, if you’re still enjoying most of them. Gareth Jones That was a great pleasure working with
Mogwai. It happened through a couple of
contacts. I met Guy through Mark Bell of LFO, when
he was producing Exciter. I met Sean, who was working with Mogwai at the
time… they needed someone to mix their record and he thought I might be able
to do a good job. So, I said, “Great!” I like Mogwai, I like the noise and the
power. I find them really hard live. If you ever go live to see Mogwai, be
prepared to be sick. It’s so loud, it’s ridiculous. You need double-strength
earplugs or something, it’s really loud. But they’re great guys and it’s a wonderful
experience for me. It was refreshing. I love working with singers and vocalists, the human
voice, but obviously it’s instrumentals so that’s amazing too. Torsten Schmidt I suppose there might be a question or two, if we can get a mic. Gareth Jones I will answer questions, as long as you guys don’t get bored. Audience member You said it’s music before technology, but what do you think about mixing in
the box exclusively? Gareth Jones I’ve done both. It’s all about our ears, isn’t it? It’s all about musical sensibility and people can do
outstanding mixes in the box. I’ve done some wonderful mixes in the box and I
enjoy it very much. But obviously, it’s all about having fun and if you’ve got
the money it’s a lot of fun to do it old style with a console. Because you get
different tones I guess, a bit. It’s a different working process. This
David’s Liar record I
talked about, we mixed that on a console. But now, whenever I mix in a studio,
which is not that often because I don’t get the budget to do it, I always
record the stems in the studio, because everything gets recorded separately and
then I put it back in the computer. Still, a week later, it’s wonderful to put
it back in the box and adjust it. Spike Stent has gone over to mixing in the
box massively. He’s a huge British mix engineer in LA. I like mixing in the
box, but my personal rig, I’ve just come out of mixing in the box a year ago
with a little valve something mixer, which I used to mix another Scottish band
called Sons and Daughters, a
Glasgow band. It was such fun that I had to buy it afterwards. I rented this valve
mixer thing. It was so great, I had such fun with it that I bought it afterwards.
It’s maybe harder to get good results in the box, but the great thing
is that you save and then you come back a week later and tweak it. So, even when I’m in
the studio, I still record everything individually on stems and put it back on
the computer, so the David’s Liar record, we finished it in my music room at
home, which is just like a front room with a sofa and a table in it. The artist
came around and we made little adjustments there on the computer to a couple
of the songs because we weren’t quite happy with where we’d got to. Audience member You said you used to use NS-10s. What do you use now? Gareth Jones At home I’ve got some PMC’s, TB2SA’s I
think they’re called. I bought them when I was working in a different space.
They don’t sound that great in my music room at home. I use headphones a lot
and I use little Genelecs. I use the big speakers to check the vibe and the bottom end and the scale. But then I spend a lot of
time mixing on small speakers. I’ve got a little stereo radio thing I use a
lot and the headphones and the little Genelecs. If I just turn it up, I get
too excited. Everything sounds great when you turn it up. So, I use a mixture
of speakers. Audience member With all the advances of modern technology, with anybody able to record an
album at home, engineer it themselves, where do you see the longevity of being an engineer being a career? With companies wanting to cut every cost under the sun, if the
act can produce their own record, it’s a major plus. They don’t want to rent
out studio spaces, everything has to be a little bit more cut down. I always
figured the producer is always needed, but it’s as much the engineering side as well. Gareth Jones Recording at home is a bit like monkeys with the typewriter. If you give 10
billion monkeys 10 billion typewriters in 10 billion years they’ll write the
works of Shakespeare, kind of thing. Just giving people the access to
technology doesn’t mean shit. I know the recording technology’s cheap now, and that’s
great. There’s loads of wonderful music being made by very talented people.
Quite a lot of my business model, if a hippie freak dropout can have a
business model, is based on people sending me files, which I then mix and send
back as two-track mixes. Because a lot of people seem to find they can get the
core of their musical idea down really well at home, in a rehearsal studio,
somewhere. But, maybe, at the mix stage they need a bit more help to have
someone with a bit of experience help them finish the record. Audience member Playing devil’s advocate here, you get those jobs through your 30 years of
reputation in the game. Obviously, your experience is much more valuable than
a 28-year-old who’s been doing engineering for five years. Presumably, there’s
a few of us here that if it’s not production we want to go down, we might want
to go down the engineering road. This kind of thing. Gareth Jones And it’s a crossover anyway. A mate of mine called James, who was an assistant
and then did some engineering for me, he’s done pretty much the same thing. He
does a lot of mixing in the spare room of his flat. I’ve not been to his new
flat, but all it is is a computer and some little speakers, some acoustic
treatment in the room. He grabbed my business model, if you like, and he’s doing pretty
good. He’s very passionate about doing it, and if you’re passionate about it, you’ve
got no choice. You’ve got to just do it anyway. That’s what he’s doing. He’s
started a little label for himself with a couple of mates. But he’s not just
mixing for that label, he’s doing work for other people because he’s focused on
developing that skill set. Obviously, there are some genius electronic
musicians, artists, producers who do everything. They write, they record all their
own shit, they mix it. That is the piece of work. But there are a lot of people who
do the writing and the recording and the performance side, and maybe they just
don’t dedicate that much time to the mixing. James has found that niche there
and he’s a much younger guy. So who knows? The industry is broken… not broken,
but it’s very different. We, the industry, had a great idea in the ’80s. We went,
“I know what we’ll do, we’ll sell the master tape to the public.” Which we
never used to do; we used to sell vinyl, which was a copy of the mythical
master tape. But then somebody had this great idea that we might as well sell
the public the master tape. And then the internet came along and everyone got
PCs, so everyone could clone the master tape really easily. The industry made
quite a lot of money from selling the master tape to us, the public, in the
’80s. But now we’re paying the price for that. People don’t bother to buy the
original in the way they did when I was young. We copied the vinyl on
cassettes, give it to a mate and said, “Check this out,” and if the mate liked it
they’d go and buy the original vinyl, because the cassette sounded so shit
compared to the vinyl. But now nobody does that, they just download a WAV. I
like vinyl anyway. My choice is to listen to vinyl at home if I like it. I
check it on Spotify, if I like it I buy the vinyl because I enjoy it. I’ve got
a nice record player. I’ll take more questions. I’m anxious to satisfy
everyone. Audience member Some of the early tracks you played use heavy panning and I’m quite sad that
panning isn’t used so much any more, putting one thing all the way to one side
and then it’s whizzed over to the other. It’s not really used that much
any more. What are your opinions on that? Do you like to use it? Gareth Jones Yeah, if I can get away with it, of course. It makes it a bit more Cinemascope, doesn’t it? And you really notice it on something like this, it’s really nice. You’re in a
good technical position, you lot here. So it’s a great way to listen to music
and I try to do that at home. But in my living room the speakers aren’t that
far apart because my wife won’t allow it. It seriously impacted my listening
space when I got married and moved in with my wife. Everything changed;
instead of dedicating the whole room to the soundsystem, it wasn’t like that
any more. But still it just seems obvious. It’s like using everything from black to
white in a photograph; why not use the whole range? It is wonderful when we’re
able to listen to loud music with the speakers spread out a bit and just the
right distance back. In this month’s Sound on Sound, one of these mix rescue
things, someone’s talking about how people who are not very good at mixing
don’t spend enough time on panning. If you’ve just got the little speakers
either side of your computer screen you almost don’t bother. If the speakers
are only this far apart, basically everything’s in the middle. That’s one of
the wonderful things if you’re able to go into a big studio – this is an
incredible soundsystem – but if you’ve got the opportunity, the speakers are a
long way apart. Suddenly, you’ve got this huge screen. So anyway, panning.
Yeah, let’s pan! [Clenches fist in the air / laughter] Audience member You said you learned on the job at the BBC thing. I was just wondering about
your engineering schools. Good luck with that, by the way. Gareth Jones Has anyone been to an engineering school? Quite a few. So, there you go, it’s a
way in. I did it one way and the other great way, which some of my colleagues –
whose work I marvel at, and I think are absolutely wonderful – is people who
got into a studio system which is rapidly dismantling anyway and learned as an
assistant at the feet of great masters. It’s obviously a wonderful way to
work. I can’t go backwards in my life, but I’d love to have had that
experience as well. But I don’t think I had the right personality when I was
young. I was mouthy, I thought I knew it all. I don’t think I would have made a
very good junior assistant, because I’d have been going up to Quincy Jones and saying,
“Look Quincy, man, I think we ought to pan it over to the left a bit more.
What do you think?” And obviously, as a junior assistant you’re just supposed
to keep your mouth shut and make the tea and just be there. So engineering
schools, it’s hard to answer, because some people have spent a lot of their own
money going to these schools. Hey, maybe it’s OK, it’s something. It’s like me
going to the BBC, maybe. I didn’t learn shit, but I learned more than I knew
before, which is probably what you can do at engineering schools as well. It
depends on your motivation. I’ve got a young colleague called Neil Quinlan who was at Alchemy in
London and he’s made it. He’s made it through the school, into the system,
he’s made it through the school into an assistant at Mute Records’ studio and
he’s now working, establishing himself a bit, doing remixes and everything.
But he was really dedicated. If you want to go to engineering school, you want to take
advantage of the equipment there and use it as much as possible, which he did.
Some people go to engineering school because they’ve got rich parents or they
smoke a lot of pot and their parents figure, “He smokes pot, he’s into music, we
might as well pay for him to go to engineering school.” [Laughter] That’s
not really going to get that much done or move you forward in life. Some
people go, “Wow, I can get my mates in, we can record.” It depends on the person. Some people get a lot out of it. Maybe the people here who went to engineering
school got a lot out of it or they wouldn’t have got here either. But loads of people don’t
and just waste their money. Audience member Do you think you missed out on anything, any formal information you could’ve
learned more quickly by going to an institution like that? Gareth Jones Not a formal institution, no. What I’m looking at is that other classic
route of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, where I could’ve got a job as a
teaboy, maybe, in a big studio, and watched the wonderful producers and
engineers make records. That would’ve been amazing. I missed out on that, sure, but I don’t think I missed
anything by not going the other way. Audience member If you start in a new control room to mix a record, do you have a selection of
two or three records you always use to test the system? Gareth Jones No, I should have. I think to do it. I know some people who do it. One reason
I don’t do that is if I go to a new space, quite often I’ve got the band there
straight away and I don’t like to play general music when I’m on a session
with a bunch of musicians. We’re making their record. I don’t want to come in
and play this Kraftwerk record, that Michael Jackson record, whatever the
references might be, this Pink Floyd track. It’s disrespectful, for me. If
I’ve got the budget where I can go in the day before and we’re setting up, that might be
a good thing to do. Big speakers take me ages to learn anyway. I found out
quite quickly that it took me ages to learn how big speakers sounded. Now I just
go. I get into a new space and start making music as quickly as possible.
That’s what I like to do in studios. I’ve spent a lot of time in studios not
making music; chatting, arguing, witnessing bands argue. That’s a great thing
to do by the way, when you’re making music, especially with a bunch of people.
If there’s a lot of ideas, it’s good to just do the ideas really quickly. Rather than – especially guys, because guys are a bit testosteroned up sometimes – “It’s my
idea, my idea, my idea!” Actually, it’s good to do both ideas really quick.
Most musical people, you listen back and in an hour you’ve sketched out all
these three different possibilities and then usually everyone agrees which is
the best way forwards. I don’t know why I’m talking about that in connection
with you. I’m talking about getting shit done in studios. That’s fun and now I
try to work like that. In the past, when I didn’t have this experience, I’d
spend time sitting around watching people argue or try to judge or help people
get through their arguments. Whereas now when I get together with music people I
just want to make music, because that’s really fun. Audience member In a sonic way, do you have a favorite-sounding record? Gareth Jones No, I like lots of different records. Audience member I’m just a bit curious, have you worked with Throbbing Gristle or Coil at all? Gareth Jones No, I never did. I missed that scene. Audience member But you worked with a lot of quite colorful characters. Do you find that
challenging or do you just enjoy it? Gareth Jones Yeah, I like colorful characters. One of my problems is that I’ve been a bit
mental myself. I’ve had to rein in my own… I’ve had to say, “Hang on a minute. It’s enough that the artist is
mental, I need to chill out.” That’s important to me and I’ve managed to do
that. Certainly, a long time ago I went through huge emotional rollercoasters
with the artists, because they’re going through this huge drama or not, then
I’m going through a huge drama or not, and I found out it’s not good for me.
But a lot of artists are larger-than-life personalities. They have to be and I
enjoy that. Audience member Thanks a lot and I was just wondering, you’ve come across a lot of equipment
in the last few decades. Is there a single piece of equipment you can think of
that revolutionized your way of working? Gareth Jones [Points at his ears] Audience member [Laughs] They’ve been there from
the beginning. Gareth Jones I know, but I didn’t know how to use them. Learning to listen has been my big
thing. You fall in love with old equipment again, you rediscover it. But I
can’t go there, it’s not about equipment, it’s about ideas. All of us are
capable of doing wonderful work if we can follow our heart and flow with it,
and do the right thing. I don’t like this equipment shit – no offense to you at all, I
understand the question, because obviously I’m a geek as well. I’ve got lots of
equipment myself, I’ve tuned it and sold everything and started again. Someone
was talking about it… Oh, Matias lost loads of stuff. I sold loads of stuff
and went totally digital and reinvented how I work, and that was really creative and
fun for me. But it’s not about equipment, I don’t think. And all the modern
equipment is amazing. Even the cheap modern equipment is so amazing compared
to the cheap old equipment. The computer was a pretty big one. That’s what I’d
say if I had to choose one. When we could put audio into computers, that
changed everything. That was pretty good. Audience member You mentioned learning to listen. So, over these decades, all this time, your
perceptions of sound must have changed. You’ve listened to lots of music, but how
can you pinpoint things about frequencies, how to separate them out so your
instruments are sounding different, you know, clear and in their own space? Gareth Jones A lot of that is practice. There’s this idea that if we spend 10,000
hours doing anything we’ll probably be quite good. Another thing I’ve found
about equipment as well is that on a lot of them, the knobs go all the way
around. It’s worth experimenting with what happens when you turn the knobs as
far as they can go and everything in between. It’s one of the arts of making a
cool-sounding record, making everything big and powerful, like the Mogwai
record. It’s like everything has to sound massive, but everything has to be clear, not
just a wall of noise. It’s experimenting with finding out frequencies that
don’t belong in that sound. I don’t do it in solo, we don’t solo individual
things. We have everything going most of the time and only occasionally do we hit
solo. So, it’s all about context. I’ve heard – I don’t know if this is true, I
wasn’t there – but apparently there was a time in Brian Eno’s production life when, as an
engineer, you were not allowed to hit solo when Brian was in the room. If you
hit the solo button, you lost the job. I’ve never met him, but obviously he’s a wonderful,
thoughtful, super-creative, talented person and he has some wonderful ideas
for all of us. I really recommend his interview in Tape Op – everything he
writes is well worth reading. But he’s very good at context and focus,
especially for mixing. No one cares what the bass drum, for example, sounds like in solo,
because no one’s ever going to hear it in solo. What counts is the whole
picture. I find quite often I can get to where I need to be quicker if I’ve
got everything on. Occasionally, I hit solo and think, “Oh, there’s lots of
subsonic, lots of low frequencies.” In digital recording, it’s more difficult
even than analog, because you capture everything. It’s quite easy to get a
recording of a high instrument, but there’s loads of sub-frequencies in there
that you don’t need. And that’s really important, just at a simple level, just
to filter out all the low frequencies you don’t need, just leave room for the
bass and the kick. Audience member You were talking about dream analysis and being Freudian, and maybe even some
substances. Keep the substances apart, but just about opening your mind,
trying to understand your mind, does that open up your perceptions or your
hearing even better? Gareth Jones Yes, and learning to listen to is learning to listen without pride and
prejudice. I’m trying to put my ego away and be open to the vision of the artist,
try to build that into something that’s good for the artist and good for the
song. Ego has not helped me in my life. It’s something I need to put away when
I work. It’s not really about me, it’s about the work. Audience member I have a very simple question. Usually, when I talk to someone who’s older
than I am – and we also have these lecturers here talking the same thing –
when I ask about the current scene and what’s going on and young musicians
doing stuff, usually it’s, “Young musicians, me no like.” What did you think about this music being made now? Audience member Who did you speak to? Audience member No, it is like this. A lot of the time this happens. Gareth Jones One of the things I really enjoy doing is working with younger bands. I really
enjoy that, because I can help move things forward, because I’ve got such a
different perspective. Obviously, I can’t work with all young people because
some young people don’t want to work with an old guy. They want to work with
their contemporaries. One of my old guy friends of mine from college the other day
said, “How come you’re still working? Don’t all the young people want to work with young people? Why do they want to work with an old guy?” It depends on
the people. That’s not everyone. The people who don’t want to work with an old
guy I never meet, but I find it super – I’ve just made a record with a young
woman called Emmy the Great. It
was her second record, but to me these people are young, in their mid-20s.
That’s fantastic because I really feel I can help them move forward. I’m so in awe of
musical talent. Some people have incredible musical talent, which I admire
enormously. So to me that’s not a problem. Am I answering your question? Audience member Yes, you are. Thank you and thank you for a brilliant lecture [applause]. Torsten Schmidt You already said it there but we thank you. I’d still like to close out with
some music. I figured with the whole ego thing to go out doing what you do
best and paying credit to the artists you work with. Before we go to “Fly On The Windscreen” as a closing
song, can you enlighten us on the role of Alan Wilder in a certain band? He
looks a little bit religious right now… not sure I’m comfortable with that. Gareth Jones Not everyone is a Depeche Mode fan and, obviously, Mode fans are fascinated by
the politics of the band. Alan’s obviously a great creative genius and it was
a wonderful pleasure and a privilege to work with him in the period when I
did. I don’t think his role is overlooked. I can’t stay there too long but a wonderful talent and great
creative contribution. A real studio dude, Alan was and is, if anyone’s seen
them on the Recoil tour recently. Torsten Schmidt OK, boring details over and over to the music, but not without a massive
amount of applause, Mr Gareth Jones, everybody. [Applause]

John Talabot
Barcelona boy John Talabot had an unusual entry to music. Just as he heard weird techno records before rock’s great building-block bands, it took a broken turntable to make him realise what was missing in dance music – and why he needed to fill that gap himself. Having broken through with "Sunshine," he’s remixed the likes of The xx and has finally recorded his debut album.
In this talk at the 2011 Red Bull Music Academy, Talabot steps out from behind the mask to explain why Barcelona suits him just fine, sampling ethics suck, and you’re better off in a studio with hardly any kit.
Hosted by Gerd Janson To my left is a young man from Barcelona, who often gets mentioned in
articles and interviews as the hyphen between indie and dance, which is an
atrocious expression. Indie-dance? And you’re also doing Balearic house music, which is another atrocious
expression. But we have the man himself here, recording for Permanent Vacation, doing remixes for the likes of The xx,
Tahiti 80, as well as Shit Robot on DFA, which is a great name. He goes by the name of John Talabot and please give him a warm welcome. [applause] John Talabot Hello. Gerd Janson John, you told me you have a very hard time defining yourself in music and what
you’re doing. Do you want to try? John Talabot Yes, I’m always being situated in the house scene but I really don’t know if
I make house. Sometimes I make it, sometimes not. But I’m not sure if house is the only definition to my music. I don’t have a real definition of my music. Gerd Janson What’s the definition of house? John Talabot I don’t know, but I know the style and how it’s been sounding for ages. Sometimes I’m not really focused on that sound, but I’m tagged as house. Why am I always tagged as house or tropical or happy music when I’m making some dark tracks? I don’t understand. Gerd Janson I forgot to mention that John is also involved in a label – I don’t know how
to pronounce it. Is it High-vern? John Talabot It’s “Ee-vern,” it’s in Catalan. Gerd Janson Hivern Discs, and Hivern is Catalan for? John Talabot Winter. Because that’s when we make music in Barcelona. In summer we don’t
make music. We go out and hang around, but we don’t make music. Gerd Janson Never in summer, as a rule? John Talabot I don’t know, but I think we don’t make so much in summer. I’ve never had
air conditioning in my studio so I don’t make it. Gerd Janson But you could move to Madrid and then you could make music all year, telling
from the weather right now. John Talabot Yeah, but I like Barcelona. I like the vibe of the city, and I like that my label is focused there. It’s
good for me, it’s a good definition of life in Barcelona. Gerd Janson So Barcelona is important for your music. It would sound different without
Barcelona? John Talabot I think so, yeah. Sometimes, when people ask me if I would move to other
cities, I’m not sure. I’ve seen a lot of musicians losing their identities
surrounded by another city. Gerd Janson Berlin? John Talabot Yeah, I didn’t want to say it, but yeah. Some musicians lost their identity
going to another city and being surrounded by another atmosphere, other clubs.
So I like the city [Barcelona]; it’s a city that is quite active, not the best for clubs, of
course. There are better cities and better places. But I like the limitation
that we have in Barcelona. It’s not a big city, it’s a small city and that’s
fine for us. We have our own place there and we can export our sound, being
from Barcelona. Sometimes it’s better to be in a small place and export
yourself than being in a really big city like Berlin, where there are so many
musicians and labels and people making music and it’s crazy. Gerd Janson How did it start for you in Barcelona? Was there a certain club or record
shop or radio show? What was your initiation or epiphany? John Talabot I didn’t have an initiation in music like a lot of people. I didn’t have big
brothers and my mother liked ‘80s Spanish bands and my father only blues and some
Beatles stuff. So there was a point that I discovered the music in the clubs
and going to clubs like Moog, places like that. I go back later. First, I discovered techno and later I discovered Joy
Division, for example. That was my
process. I never had an older brother who showed me Joy Division or came to my
house with that record or in my school. I didn’t have that opportunity. I
first discovered Jeff Mills. Gerd Janson But Jeff Mills is quite an alien phenomenon in itself. What was it that attracted you? John Talabot I don’t know. When I went to a club and I discovered music, I’d never experienced music so loud. So
the first impression was, “What’s that?” Later I kept going further into
music, discovering different styles, moving from styles like the first
Warp, the first
Rephlex records. All the music that I could find in the club, I liked to continue discovering more and more and more until I
arrived in the ‘60s and ‘50s. I didn’t have the usual process; I didn’t
discover music, like if you grow up with a band or whatever. I discovered some
strange Rephlex records, like Aphex Twin before bands that are more popular. Gerd Janson You started DJing, having come from record collecting. John Talabot When I started going to the clubs, it was a problem. When you heard a track
the only way to know it was going to Soulseek or buying it in a record store.
There was no internet, so you didn’t have the opportunity to know music
through YouTube and going by labels or artists. Now it’s quite easy to find
good tracks or whatever, but in the beginnings of 2000 and the end of the ‘90s it was
harder. If you liked a track the DJ was playing, you had to go and ask him
what it was. I always went with a notebook, writing it down. This is what I’mn going to buy. Gerd Janson Like a real trainspotter. John Talabot [laughs] Totally, yeah. Gerd Janson And you were never shy about it? John Talabot They called me window-licker sometimes, because I was in the window of the DJ
booth. [laughter] I remember that, it was funny. But it was different from today. Gerd Janson It was hard work. John Talabot Yeah, it was hard work but you didn’t have the opportunity to find so much
music then. Gerd Janson Before we listen to one of your own tracks, to give people an opportunity to
see what your music sounds like, give us one of those window-licker tracks
that you found with a pad and a pen. (music: D’Arcangelo – unknown / applause) Gerd Janson What was it we just heard? John Talabot This was a record from
D’Arcangelo, an Italian act. I
think it was discovered by
Passarani from
his label Nature that he started in the ‘90s. It was one of my favorite
records that I always wanted to have, one of my golden records. All the sleeve was golden and it was a treature to find. I just bought it on eBay when I
had a little bit of money, because in those days it was expensive to find. It’s
one of my favorite tracks by this act. They have another nice record on
Nature and they released two or
three albums. They are playing Barcelona this week, I think. They played maybe yesterday or next
week, I don’t know. Gerd Janson But you didn’t go? John Talabot No, I was here. Gerd Janson And how long had you been searching for that record then? John Talabot I remember it was pretty hard to find. At the time there was no Discogs, or
Discogs was not so active, so I had to search on eBay and make some bids. Putting
the alarm clock at 3 AM to go and make a bid. To buy a record. My mom was like, “What are you doing, getting up at 3 AM for a record?” Gerd Janson But you know they’ve invited these sniper programs. John Talabot Yes, but I wasn’t sure how it worked. You have to leave your log-ins. Gerd Janson You didn’t trust the sniper. John Talabot No, I didn’t trust it. Some people told me that it worked. I don’t
know if it existed at that time, actually. Gerd Janson Do you think the modern times take the fun and the mystery a little bit out of the whole
record collecting thing? These days it’s just if you’re willing to pay the
price you are able to get it. John Talabot Yeah, I don’t want to look old when I answer these questions. But yeah, for me it’s lost a
little bit of magic. It’s easier now, but still there are some records that
you can’t find. At the end it’s what you want to find, and if you have the
force or the energy you will find it. I think Discogs do a really nice job for
the vinyl searchers. You can know the price and the median average sale price.
At the time it didn’t exist and when you were buying records on the internet
you could only hear 20 seconds of the track. And you were, “What am I supposed
to do? Should I buy this record? Is it strange enough? Will I use it for
sampling? Will I use it for anything else?” At the end, it was your decision
to spend €40 on a record that you didn’t know. But sometimes it’s good to do
those crazy things. Sometimes when you do that you find really nice records
that you never expected. Gerd Janson And sometimes it goes horribly wrong. John Talabot Yeah, and you try to resell it. [laughs] Gerd Janson It doesn’t always work. But yeah, let’s listen to a track of yours that put you on the
map. I’ve got it here because you forgot to bring it. It’s called “Sunshine”
and it was released on Winter Discs. John Talabot No, it was released on May, just before summer. Gerd Janson No, I mean because your label is called... John Talabot Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it was released on our label. It was quite a limited
release because I wasn’t sure how it would go, so in the end we did about 300
or 250 copies. Gerd Janson As a first run. John Talabot Yeah, but it was strange because then it got really popular and was reviewed
by some media. Sometimes it’s quite strange that it got into huge media, a
release that is only on vinyl, 250 copies. How did it get there? I don’t
understand. Sometimes with the internet you have the feeling that everything
grows too fast. You put something on the internet and later the media take it
and put it in another place, it goes to another place and some people retrieve
it and, oh, it’s 7,000 listeners listening to this track? It’s crazy. That’s
what I think happened with “Sunshine,” but I don’t think it’s my best track. Gerd Janson I didn’t say it’s your best track, but we should listen to it nonetheless. (music: John Talabot – “Sunshine” / applause) So if you look this up on YouTube and go to the comments sections – which is
not the smartest corner of mankind – someone wrote, “Quite boring for a long
time.” Can you talk a little bit about that? Because most of your tracks are
long. I didn’t say they were boring, but what’s attractive to you about that? John Talabot When I made those tracks, they were some kind of response for what I wanted
to play. I’d been resident at nights and I was going to the stores, but not
finding music that I liked. So at the end there was a point where it was,
“What am I going to do?” I tried to buy records but I couldn’t find something
that was exciting. One day I went to the record store and I took five records
up to listen to and they sounded really punchy and distorted. They were really raw. I liked that feeling. I was, “Whoa! These records are amazing, I want to play
them.” I took them home to listen and when I got there they were some kind of
minimal techno records. Gerd Janson So you got the wrong bag? John Talabot No, so I went back to the store and said, “Hey, when I listen to them here
they sounded one way, but when I listened at home they sound like all the
other stuff.” They said, “Oh, you listened to it there. Yeah, sorry, it’s broken, it
doesn’t sound good.” I realized what I wanted was the sound that was broken. Gerd Janson The record player was broken? John Talabot Yes, and the sound coming out from the headphones was totally devastating. At
the end, it was some kind of error. But I liked what I was hearing, so I
decided to focus on that kind of sound. “Sunshine” and the other first tracks
were only things for me to play in my sets. I wanted this vibe in my sets, so
they are quite boring, yeah. [laughs] Gerd Janson I didn’t say they’re boring. They’re long but they’re not boring. I was just
pointing it out because in, again, modern times – and we sound like old men now... John Talabot Yeah, it’s long and the reason is I wanted long tracks to play, I like long tracks
to mix and put some things on the top. At that time, it was fine for me that
it was long. Now, I’m not doing so many long tracks, but when you do music you
do it in that time and my feeling at that time was [like that].
Actually, “Sunshine” is a jam session. It was done while I was playing with it
and it’s as long as it is because I never cut it. Gerd Janson So what are your production values? John Talabot When I did that I had one sampler and the computer. I had a 10-year-old
computer that I want to change now because I made the other one crazy. I want
to move to another computer but I’m afraid of moving to another computer and
not being able to do the same music. It’s a little bit stupid but it’s the
way it is. I’ve been working with really old programs like [Ableton]
Live 4, which is quite old – I
think they’re now onto Live 9. The sound changed in that time. I can feel the
difference between 9 and 4, for the first tracks I prefer 4. Gerd Janson You mentioned a sampler. John Talabot I had an Electribe and some
drum machines that I use for some percussion. The toms, I think they’re taken from the... I’m not
sure what drum machine, but they’re taken from some drum machine. It was quite
simple. I usually work with a really simple set-up because I like the feeling
that I can control the stuff. When you have all the plug-ins and everything these days, you lose time
learning how to use them. So it was faster for me to use the things I
had, like one sampler, one program and nothing else. It was more easy for me to
control. It was better for me to make music faster and safer. Gerd Janson So you would say there is the beauty of restriction? John Talabot Totally, I love restrictions. On the album I use a lot of restrictions for
myself. Like, I’ll say I want to do this track with only this drum machine or
this track with only this synthesizer. One of my favorite styles is Chicago
house and Chicago house was born
from a four-track machine, one drum machine and one synthesizer. And for me
it’s one of the nicest [kinds of] music ever. I know limitations are good if
you can be creative with them. Gerd Janson So you say if you limit yourself you put more emphasis on the musical idea? John Talabot Nowadays, you have so many kits. You have to take one snare and you have
3,000 snares and you spend one hour going [imitates various snare sounds].
So you say, oh, I lost one hour listening to snares and I don’t remember which ones I want to use. So at the end limitations for me are easier because maybe you can
get an idea you were searching for. But you limit yourself and try to find
that idea with what you have. At the end, for me it’s easier that way. I don’t
know how to explain it, but I’ve been losing a lot of time listening to [imitates snare sounds]. I’m tired of that. So at the end I’ve bought some machines for not trying to do that, with kits and everything. Gerd Janson We have to get back to the sampler. You like to sample, right? John Talabot Yeah. Gerd Janson With records? John Talabot Yeah. Gerd Janson MP3s? John Talabot Yeah. Gerd Janson Everything? John Talabot Everything I can get. Gerd Janson Can you talk a little bit about your sample ethics? John Talabot There are no ethics. I don’t like ethics. I don’t like the restrictions on sampling, I don’t feel
it’s creative. OK, there was a time when people took, like, a Latin track and
they put drum percussion on top, a girl singing [imitates voice] and for me
that’s not sampling. Sampling is something more creative. When I started my
project, I liked about sampling that I could get sounds that I’d never be
able to get. I could never have five musicians in my studio recording drums with a mixer from the ‘60s, or the best guitarist in the world playing for me. So in
the end it’s some kind of vibe I couldn’t get and sampling allows me to do
that. For me, it’s just a game. I try to combine different samples like a
puzzle and it’s like a game, you try this and you try that, you try this and
you try that. This is good with this part, this is bad with this part. You keep
changing and keep tuning and at the end it goes like “Africa”! Wow! Cool,
perfect, I’ve made it. Gerd Janson So it’s a trial and error process. John Talabot I like it when it’s like that. In the beginning when I was making tracks for
me to play, it was some kind of error. Error and trial. It’s really simple, actually. It’s nothing
that everyone can do. I don’t feel special for doing “Sunshine.” I think that everybody here could do that. Gerd Janson But they would need to find your sample sources then. John Talabot I’ve been growing, listening to a lot of music and I always put the sample in
a folder or save the record and say, “One day, one day I will use this!” At the end, sometimes
you use it. Sometimes it has success, and sometimes the track is not good. But I
like to collect sounds from strange places and buy strange records that
apparently don’t have any special thing, but you can always find that special
thing. But I think that this is the hip-hop story. I’m not going to discover
anything with this. I only want to put some hip-hop productions into house, so
I was listening to a lot of hip-hop, like the
Madlib stuff. I liked the sound because it was organic, and at the time I was
playing the records didn’t sound organic or with some kind of soul – they
sounded really, really unhuman. So it was like, “I don’t want to play more
non-human music, more [imitates electronic sound].” I was tired of that, so
I started making my own tracks. Gerd Janson But how important is it for you that the sources can’t be detected? John Talabot Oh, actually I don’t care. Gerd Janson You don’t care if it’s recognizable? John Talabot No, if the track is good. I remember when the second Daft Punk album came out and nobody
realized they were all samples. Later with YouTube everyone was, “Wow, they’re
all samples. It’s incredible.” Nobody cares at the moment if they’re all
samples or not, only if it’s good. OK, if you sample, say, “Billie
Jean,” and make your own track.
Oh, cool. Really nice. [sarcastically] But if you take some time to put some elements and
samples together that apparently don’t fit together, I think that’s a good process
for being creative. It’s a good way to start making music. Gerd Janson And you’ve never been afraid of somebody knocking on your door? John Talabot Totally. Actually, I sampled one of the most important bands ever but nobody
realized. I’m quite happy because I was really afraid, and nobody came and said, “Hey, you did
that?” So it’s the way you do it and with what ending. If you want to sample
the Beatles because you think that you’ll be successful with a version of one
of their tracks then you’ll get busted, maybe. But if you use it for a
creative thing, like you like that sound and want it for your track, then I
think that’s good. Gerd Janson Is that also how you approach your remix work, then? John Talabot Sometimes. With remixes it’s a story of hate and love. Sometimes, being a remixer is the best thing you can do in music. But sometimes it’s pretty hard
putting all that effort into something that’s not your own. It’s like picking
from another guy and making... For, me it’s exhausting. So I don’t approach
remixes only by the samples. Sometimes I like to play keyboards, or sometimes
I only leave the percussion. Sometimes I use everything and combine it differently. Every remix
is different because every remix has different parts. Sometimes you’ll receive
a remix and at the end you decide not to do it because at the end you’re unable to do something good. “I can’t, it’s not for me, I can’t work it.” This happens to
me sometimes. Gerd Janson But they pay you to work it. John Talabot Yeah, but you get better at the end so it doesn’t matter. You say, “I can’t do it, sorry. I tried it but I didn’t feel it, so I was unable to do it.” Gerd Janson No, I meant that sometimes people tend to do remixes because they’re well
paid. John Talabot Of course, it’s a good income, especially for people who have labels and have
to pay for releases. It’s always good to have some income because you have to
advance money for the label and I put a lot of the money that I make in remixes
into the label. Sometimes it’s good to make remixes. I feel proud of some of
the remixes I’ve done, so I’m quite happy with them. Gerd Janson Do you want to show us one of those that make you proud? (music: The xx – “Shelter (John Talabot Remix)” / applause) So what was it we just heard? John Talabot It was a remix of “Shelter” by the xx. I’m quite happy of it. Sometimes you
receive tracks and you feel you will not be able to do better than the original.
I really liked the original and was really afraid of doing the remix, but in the end
over the years I felt it was one of my favorite remixes because it has the
vibe of the original but with my style. That’s the point of making a remix, I think –
putting your point of view on the track. Gerd Janson And what was the xx’s point of view of your mix? John Talabot They didn’t want it. Actually, it was some kind of strange connection with
the label. I was doing a record for the label and they sent me a record and I
was, “Wow, I really like this track.” They said, “Yeah, you can do a remix.”
“Cool.” They sent me the stems and I made the remix and one year later they
put it out. “We realized that we like it.” That’s nice. Gerd Janson So how hard or annoying is it for you to work with other labels while having
your own? John Talabot For me, it’s not annoying. Sometimes you get better with people and sometimes
it’s not so good. Sometimes, when you work with big labels to make remixes
it’s quite hard because you have deadlines and that kind of stuff that I hate.
I can be working one day on a remix and if I don’t like it I have to throw
everything [away]. Sometimes people don’t understand that at the end it’s some kind of
creative process and you have to be inspired to do it. I know inspiration
comes by working and all that, but at the end it’s not true. You can be two, three,
four days working on something and at the end you say, “I don’t like it, I
don’t want to put it out.” So you have to start again. Sometimes with remixes
you receive tracks that are not good and you have to make them good from your
point of view. I don’t like putting out remixes I don’t like. If I see that I
can do it and if it’s the deadline and I don’t have it, I say, “I can do it if I
have more time. If not I can’t do it.” So at the end it’s what you want to put
out and the quality you want to put out. You can be doing remixes every week if you want, but you don’t want to bore people. I think I’ve been doing too much remixes. [laughs] Gerd Janson So you have to learn to say no. John Talabot Yeah, but I like to do them. Gerd Janson So what are you looking for if you give someone your own music? John Talabot Sometimes money, sometimes you like the track. It depends. Gerd Janson I don’t mean remixes now, I mean your own music, if you want to work with
another label. John Talabot Sometimes, it’s that I like the label and I want to be part of it. I don’t
know how long I’ll be in music, but I want to be happy after ten years and
look back and say, “I think I did the correct thing and worked with people I
wanted to work with and I’ve made the things I wanted to make.” I don’t want
to look back and say, “Oh, I should’ve worked with these people and I should’ve
worked with that one.” If I want to work with someone I try to get in touch
with them and I try to do things with them. If I don’t like the label or whatever, at the end I say I
don’t want to work with them. When I think of my career, my project, I try to
be proud of everything I do. That’s something I have inside. I want to be
proud of everything I do and everything I work on. Even if the track is the
worst track, I want to be happy with the remix, to be able to say that I’ve
done my best and I’m happy with the result. Gerd Janson So is there a life after music? John Talabot I hope so. I think the music business is quite cruel. Sometimes you are here,
sometimes you are there, and I don’t know where I will be in five years or ten
years. So I want to do now what I have to do and give the energy to the
project that I think it should receive. I don’t want to do things that I don’t
feel and I don’t want to put energy into things if I don’t feel them. This
project is special, and I want to feel it like that. If I feel in two years’
time that this project doesn’t have identity, then I will leave it, I will
take it out. Gerd Janson Nile Rodgers said the other day that he thinks when you’re a musician or a
producer and you have fun, you always find a way to make a living out of it.
How hard is it these days and what do you think about that? John Talabot I suppose, he’s a producer and he’s quite good at doing what he does. Gerd Janson I guess he doesn’t have to worry about where the milk comes from. John Talabot Exactly. It’s easy to say when you’ve done what he has done. Everybody would
like to be like him, but I don’t have the talent or the skills that maybe he has and I have to
accept that. I’m doing what I’m doing, but I don’t know what I’ll be doing in
five years. So I want to focus now on this project. If I feel it’s going well and
if it goes further, that’s cool, and if it doesn’t work I’d prefer to leave it
and say, “That was the project, it was nice, a really special time of my
life,” and look at it like that. Gerd Janson Connecting to that, how hard is it for you to run a label then? How do you keep the
balance? John Talabot It’s funny but it’s a lot of work. We have to make special designs and that
stuff, bring records and make silk screenings, the kind of shit that leaves
plenty of ink on the floor of your house, and you have to clean it later and it
doesn’t get out easily. It’s something you have to do for passion, you
don’t get money or anything, only the passion to do it. For me, having a label
is part of my project too. Gerd Janson So when you talk about ink and silk screens, obviously you still try to put
out vinyl. John Talabot Yeah. I try to put out vinyl and we do it the best way we can, spending more
money than we get. [laughs] It’s a bit of a suicidal business. But it’s part of my project, so I feel that part of the money I get I have to invest in that. Gerd Janson Is it nostalgia? John Talabot Nostalgia? No, it’s part of my life. Gerd Janson I mean, putting out records. John Talabot No, it’s a limited business, I know that. But it’s not nostalgia. It’s
something that I want to do, something I like to do. I don’t know, when you have
vinyl, you have digital. Sometimes people go to the physical store to see
what’s going on and you don’t have the same music in the physical store as the
digital store. I don’t know why, but people like Four Tet or Caribou are only putting out vinyl. They’re doing quite well, so I think they’re doing vinyl in a good way. We like doing vinyl because it gives you some kind of status in the music business, I think. Gerd Janson So you think if someone takes the effort to put out something physical it
gives it the stamp of quality, because it takes work to do it. John Talabot No, no, the quality depends on the music. But he’s taking a risk on what he
believes, so you have to take care of that. Maybe it’s not the best music, but if someone decides to spend
€1,000 on putting out a release, then he believes in what he’s doing and you
have to take that into account. There’s a lot of people who don’t trust their
music and don’t think it’s good enough to put on vinyl, because they think the
people who like it won’t consider vinyl, they prefer to buy it on digital.
That’s their target. But we like to put out vinyls. We’ve been buying
vinyl since we were kids and we like to do it. Gerd Janson But it’s not vinyl-only, right? John Talabot No. Gerd Janson I always find that’s a very Western Civilization kind of thinking. If
you put out something that’s vinyl-only you exclude a great part of the rest
of the world who just don’t have this old-school record shop DJ business model. Every big city has a DJ shop and you go there and buy records. You know what I
mean? John Talabot I’m not sure. Gerd Janson If you go a city like São Paulo, for instance, there’s just no shop for DJs. John Talabot OK, people get digital. But at the end sometimes you decide to put out vinyl because it’s
something special you don’t have, or there’s a sample that you don’t own the rights to. For different reasons you can make it a special, make it only limited.
Being vinyl or digital depends on the label conditions. Some people want to
put everything on vinyl and only 500 people have that. Later, the internet
will spread the release on forums and in some parts of the world through blogs
and whatever. Sometimes labels prefer to get money from the digital and put it
out on vinyl and digital, sometimes they decide to only put it on digital. I
don’t think it’s important if the music is good, I don’t see it as important.
I don’t understand if a track is better for being on digital or vinyl. If a
track is good it’s good. Sometimes there is – I don’t know how to say it in
English – some kind of mysticism of vinyl. “I have to get that because it’s
only on vinyl and it will be raised to €40 on Discogs and I don’t have that
release.” Gerd Janson It’s better than a stock market at the moment. John Talabot I’ve seen records that have gone up to €80 two weeks after they get out. Some
people will go to the store and buy two, like they’re gold. “In two years I will sell them.” So yeah, maybe you’re right. Gerd Janson We talked about restrictions and you restrict yourself as an artist. Not in
terms of what you put out, but for you to sit here in front of the cameras is
new for you. You try to keep your face out of the limelight. Can you talk a
little bit about that? John Talabot That was totally an artistic decision, I didn’t want to do photos with my
face. It was nothing to do with
Burial or things like
that. I play with my face, I don’t wear a mask or whatever. Gerd Janson You play with your face? John Talabot Yeah, I play with my face the way it is. [laughs] That’s nice sometimes,
sometimes it’s not so nice. But I didn’t want to have those typical DJ photos. Gerd Janson Sunglasses, headphones. John Talabot I don’t feel it, I wanted to do something different. I don’t mind that people
don’t know who I am or how I dress. I want to be more ethereal or something like that. For the first years I only had one logo and that was enough; I didn’t want
anything else. I don’t do a lot of interviews and that kind of stuff, because I don’t like doing that. Gerd Janson How did that work for you in these days of Facebook video raves? John Talabot Some people get more angry than others and don’t understand it. But in the
end, it’s an artistic decision and they have to understand I’m doing this
because it was something I wanted to do. It’s for students of the Academy and
I wanted to do it. But sometimes it’s like, “We want to interview you for TV,” and it’s like, “I know what questions you’ll ask me and I don’t want to be there.” Gerd Janson What questions will they ask you? John Talabot I don’t know, like, “Why are you not showing your face?” Gerd Janson Like I just did. [laughter] John Talabot Yeah, but we are here and I understand you have to ask that question. It’s
part of my project and restrictions. It was something I didn’t want to have my
face in magazines, I feel strange with that. I realized I didn’t feel
comfortable with that and it was better that I put some kind of paper in my face. Gerd Janson Speaking of artistic decisions, what was your artistic decision to do an
album? You do music that is more or less oriented towards the dancefloor. John Talabot [hesitantly] Yeeeah. Gerd Janson Depends on the dancefloor, but music you can dance to. What was the concept
for doing an album? It’s not full of dance tracks, is it? John Talabot No. You’ve heard it. [laughs] It was a decision that I wanted to make an
album without any of the tracks that I’d previously released and I wanted to
make an album that wasn’t focused in any age or time. So I wanted to make new
tracks with a different vibe. It’s a mixture of ‘80s, ‘90s tracks, I don’t
know. It’s really typical what I’m saying and I would like to explain it in better
English, but I wanted to make something that has some correlation between it.
I didn’t want to have punched tracks in the middle. I wanted to have a whole
concept and I think it was a dark concept. I didn’t want to set the album in a
special age. When you listen, I don’t know if you have the feeling that it was
made nowadays or that it could’ve been made 20 years before. Gerd Janson But it’s made in the winter, right? John Talabot [hesitantly] Yeees, but some tracks were made in the summer, in my
studio sweating like that. “I have to finish this, I have to finish this!” Some kind of titanic
work. I think I put too much of myself in the album, I took it too seriously.
I’m not sure it will work out. At the end maybe I did a strange thing that I
shouldn’t. Gerd Janson Should we listen to a strange thing? John Talabot Yeah. Maybe. (music: John Talabot – “So Will Be Now” / applause) Gerd Janson So you played the dance track off the album? John Talabot Yeah, the last one. I didn’t know which one I had so I played this one. Gerd Janson And the voice is sampled? John Talabot Yes, it’s sampled and sung by Pional,
a friend of mine here in Madrid, and we combined something with his vocals to
make that kind of different effect. Gerd Janson So, even if you have a singer, you sample him? John Talabot Yep. Yeah, that’s true. I didn’t think of that. But I like to manipulate the
vocals the best I can. Sometimes it’s easier for me to have a vocal and do
my job and having the vocal, rearrange it the way I want, than have someone in and say, “Go ahead and sing.”
Sometimes it’s easier for me to have the vocals and use it the way I like, as
if they’re an instrument. Gerd Janson So you record the singer and then send him away? John Talabot Not always. With “Families,” I
did the track, then later I met the girl and we decided which vocal theme we
wanted. She sung on the top and it was perfect. But sometimes it’s difficult
for me to explain to a singer what I want because I’m not a singer or a
musician and I don’t know how to explain myself in English. Sometimes it’s
hard. [laughs] Gerd Janson You could find Spanish singers. John Talabot Yeah, but they don’t have good accents in most cases. Gerd Janson They could sing in Spanish. John Talabot Yeah, they could sing in Spanish but I haven’t made a Spanish track. I have
to. Gerd Janson And it would sound strange for you on a track like this to have someone sing in
your native tongue? John Talabot Not at all, no, I could understand what they’re saying. Sometimes Spanish
people have the feeling that it doesn’t sound good or it’s difficult for us to
hear a track when it’s made in Spanish. For example, when I listen to some
Spanish tracks there are a few musicians that I like who can sing in Spanish.
El Guincho is one of them, I he has made his own style singing in Spanish and
I think it’s really difficult. And I don’t feel like working in Spanish at the
moment. Gerd Janson But maybe in the future. You mentioned “Families” – that was for Young
Turks. It’s another one of the... John Talabot It’s part of the four-track EP that was released on Young Turks. My main
objective was working with a singer,
Glasser. I really like her vocals, so
I tried to meet her in London and make her sing on top of the track. I’m quite
happy with the results. I really like the track, I feel proud of it. Gerd Janson But the album won’t be released on Young Turks? John Talabot No, it’ll be released on Permanent Vacation. I think it’s quite a strange one
for them. Gerd Janson Why is it strange for them? John Talabot When you listen to the album, sometimes you feel it’s not what you’d expect
from a label like Permanent Vacation, but I don’t care too much. They decided
to put it out and it’s their label so they’ll know what they want. At the end
I gave them the album and they said, “Yeah, we like it, we want to do it and
we will do it your way.” They didn’t ask me for any changes. I know that sometimes
people focus Permanent Vacation in one style or whatever. It’s difficult to put
some music on there and my album is quite strange. Gerd Janson And why don’t you put it out yourself, because you have your own label? You
could be artist and label owner in one person and have total control of
everything. John Talabot Yeah, that’s true but I signed a contract with Permanent Vacation and I
want to release it there, of course. But there is some relationship with them and they trust
in the project and they want to do it, so I think they have to. Gerd Janson So you think it’s also important for an artist to sometimes give his stuff
away to someone to make them work with it? John Talabot Yes, I’ve never worked an album before. I would like to, but I think I need
distance from my music and give it to another person and say, “Finished – now
it’s your job and I won’t do anything. It’s your time, you have to invest your
time in selling it or throwing it into the fire, but I don’t have to do
anything with it.” Gerd Janson And they didn’t want to put your face on the cover? John Talabot Yeah, it’s my face on the cover. No, they don’t care about it, they are really
nice people. Gerd Janson That’s good. Should we open it up to any questions from the audience, if
there are any? Audience Member Sorry, this might not be a fully formed question. I was talking earlier today
about the concept that if you record the human voice, even if it’s only a
short bit of the voice, that it captures something of the life that they’ve
lived and their experiences. Do you share that sort of opinion? Is that
anything to do with why you sample things? John Talabot I think I don’t understand the question. It’s my fault, my English. Audience Member If you sample someone’s voice, even if it’s only a small amount of the voice,
there’s an element of the experiences that person’s had, the life that they’ve
lived, the things that they think, even if it’s just a small amount. I wonder if
that’s an opinion you share or it’s something you’ve thought about. Talking
about sampling, and even sampling someone you’ve got access to... John Talabot I don’t know if it’s about the sample itself or how you use it in a track.
Sometimes using a really short sampling of the voice, it can give you an uplifting moment
that, for example, in the rave they used to put that kind of vocal on top in
the moment to... Gerd Janson The climax. John Talabot Yeah, the climax of the track, they put that repetitive vocal in. But I’m not
sure if it’s the vocal itself or how you use it, or I don’t know if I understood the
question. Audience Member You can look at it as a technical exercise. You pick out a vocal and you know
that the sonics of it will make people feel a certain way. So it doesn’t
matter what the intention is. Or it could be the other way, where it’s more
about the feeling of the person who originally recorded it and you’re tapping
into their life. John Talabot But sometimes you distort so much the vocals so that in the end it’s not even that person, so you
don’t understand what they’re saying. I think it has something more to do with
how you relate it to a style or a moment or an age or a track that reminds you
of that vocal and you feel, “Yeah, that’s good ‘cause it reminds me of that
way.” Or a lot of people are using that resource for doing dubstep or that
kind of thing, like pitching vocals. Or, for example, the Knife use the vocal and pitch-shift it down and have that strange vibe on the vocals. I’m not sure if it’s what it
says or what you record; it’s the effect on itself. It has to do with a
feeling that you have. It’s how you modify the vocal. For example, I’m not
good with lyrics, I don’t make songs. When I was doing the track with Glasser, I
explained to her what I wanted. But I’m not good with lyrics, like saying, “Yeah, I feel this and I want to say it.” For me, it’s really difficult and I’m not sure I can do
it. Using vocals for me is like using an instrument, too, so I like to use it that
way because it’s the only way I know. It’s for giving some kind of feeling to
a track, not only using synthesizer but using a vocal too. It’s been that way
since I remember, even music from the ‘80s and ‘90s. Gerd Janson It doesn’t have to make lyrical sense to you? John Talabot No, not at all. Like I said, I’m not good with lyrics and songs, so at the
end I like the vibe the vocal gives it to me but I don’t care what it’s saying or what language or whatever. Gerd Janson Unless it’s not Spanish. John Talabot Yeah, unless it’s not Spanish, that’s true. Gerd Janson Another one. Can you pass the mic, please? Audience Member What are your plans regarding a live act? Can you give us some idea of what
it’s going to be? When? John Talabot I don’t know when but I’d like it to make it with another person. I’d like to
have some vocals in the tracks and I can play some stuff together with him. I
think I’ll do it with Pionale, too. We need to prepare that. I don’t want
to be with my computer doing a live show because at the end I’ve done that in my studio
and I don’t have a lot of fun doing this kind of things for a live show. So at
the end I’m preparing a lot of percussion, maybe more band-oriented
but not a band because we are only two people. Gerd Janson So it would make more sense in a festival than in a club? John Talabot I’m not sure. Actually, it’s quite strange. I’ve seen a lot of live acts.
Electronic artists are bringing the band concept to the club. Like the live
act of Nicolas Jaar, who’s
bringing the instruments into the club. It’s nice because people react really
well to that vibe. I think people have become a little bit of tired of looking at
people with laptops, so they’re happy to have people playing stuff in a club
too. Audience Member Yes, please. Audience Member I really enjoy your music. Simple question – why drums? John Talabot Why? I don’t understand. Audience Member For me personally, I’ve been going through this battle in my head of why do I
even need drums for some things. Your stuff is really ethereal and dreamy and
I can almost imagine it as long, extended ambient pieces. I’m curious if you
ever do that stuff and then think, “This needs drums”? What is it about the
percussion? John Talabot Actually, when I start making music usually the first part I do is the drum
programming, that’s something I really enjoy to do. When I started the project
the only thing I was looking for is some music that I wanted to play in my
sets. At the beginning it was created for that reason, that’s why they are
long tracks, they are boring tracks. Gerd Janson I didn’t say they were boring. John Talabot No, no, no, I say it because of the YouTube people. I really take the YouTube
people into consideration because they are the people. [laughter] Gerd Janson Yeah, yeah, sure. John Talabot I will speak with that guy, I think. I’ll ask him what I should do with my
tracks to make it better. So the drums are part of my music. The drums, then the
melodies, it’s the combination of both. So I don’t know why they say ethereal,
I think it’s quite aggressive. And I didn’t want that for the album, that’s why I reduced the drums on the album. I didn’t want 11 tracks of punching your head
over 15 minutes like “Sunshine.” I’ve never listened to a complete house
album, only maybe the complete Daft Punk album or some other bands like that.
But I’ve never listened to a complete house album, so I didn’t want to make a
house album. Audience Member Have you considered making tracks without drums? John Talabot Yeah, but I’ve never done it. [laughs] Audience Member It’s scary. John Talabot So maybe it doesn’t make sense for me at the moment. Audience Member As far as your creative process, you said you like to start with the drums.
If you can give us the order in an arrangement of a track. How long does it
take you? John Talabot It really depends. Sometimes, I like to sample an old drum kit I found in
some records. I like to sometimes use the drums as melodies, so I like to tune
it to make melodies with drums, like sub-frequencies, to take it to the tune
of the track. So it depends a lot on what I’m looking for with the track. But
what I’ve been doing mostly is finding a good kick drum first. When I’ve got
that, I move to the other parts of the track. I focused on the kick drum because
I wanted my tracks to get punchy. It has a bit of relation to what I was listening
to at the time. I was listening to hip-hop and I wanted to have that feeling
of the kick drums that were more analog, more live, not so digital. I didn’t
get it how I wanted, because it doesn’t sound as analog as I wanted. But it’s quite
the way I could get it, it has the vibe I wanted. When I start making a rhythm
I usually start with the claps, hi-hats and drums. This is how I learned to DJ
and the things I like when I hear a rhythm. I’m quite simple like that. Audience Member Hi, I found it good that you said you didn’t make music in the summer. I think a lot of us over-fixate on making music 24 hours a day. I just want you to talk about what taking summer into winter and being creative does. JOhn Talabot The creative process is something that I’ve been, how do you say it in English? I experienced this year a hard creative process with the album, and I lost part of my life on the way. So it’s been a little bit painful because I had been trying to put a lot of effort on an album, and when I sit to make music I never know when I will finish. There are some people that they will spend, like, four hours doing a track and they will get something. I’m not that kind of person because I think I'm not a good producer. Audience Member I think you’re a great producer. John Talabot No, no. Producer like producer, you sit down and you do your job. Like when you pay a producer, you want a guy at your side that comes here and says, “OK, we will spend five hours and we’ll get a rhythm, a melody and we’ll have a track.” Like The-Dream, if you see videos of The-Dream on the internet doing a track in like 45 minutes, and he makes two hits. That’s when you want a producer, you want a guy on your side making that. And I don’t do that because I don’t feel it and I don’t get the point. So in the end it’s like my creative process is very slow, and that’s why it took so long making the album. I spent winter and summer making it. Audience Member Thanks. Gerd Janson Any more? So I guess... John Talabot It’s over? Gerd Janson It’s over. John Talabot, thank you very much. [applause]

Fabio
If you want to know about drum & bass, listen to Mr. Fabio. Having broken through in the late ’80s playing funk and rare groove on London pirate station Phase One, he was somewhere towards the centre of pretty much any new movement in British electronic music for nearly a decade after.
In this lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy, the godfather of drum & bass talks soul music as a secret identity and his formative years.
Hosted by TORSTEN SCHMIDT It’s a special honor today to welcome the man they call Fabio because in a round about way most of us, if not all of us, wouldn’t be sitting here if it wasn’t for him and a couple of other folks. So let’s give the man a hand [applause]. Funnily enough, while we were thinking of boring DJ issues like ‘back’ and ‘sciatic’ and these kind of problems that you encounter, I found another similarity which was that one of the first people to give both of us a break was a man called Colin Dale. And he’s one of the most undervalued characters in this whole thing. Fabio Colin Dale was a big inspiration for me. He was a soul DJ, came from the same background as me, he’s from Brixton in South London which is like England’s equivalent of Detroit, really. Very ghetto, very black, and Colin was always into electronic music from very early, like late ‘70s, early ‘80s. And he used to be into a lot of hi-NRG, early hi-NRG stuff. He taught me about the whole techno thing, he brought me to see Derrick May, Juan Atkins and Blake Baxter in 1987 at a place called Legends. The problem with Colin, Colin never believed in himself enough as a DJ. I think he was a great inspiration to people but he didn’t believe in himself enough and when the whole rave thing took off in ‘88 he kind of missed the boat a little bit but he is probably my biggest inspiration. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you say he was into the hi-NRG stuff, that wasn’t the most normal thing for a young black youth to like in London at that time, was it? Fabio We was into some different shit. I went through the whole black thing, being into dub, into disco, into funk and I met Colin and Colin just turned my ear a lot to a lot of stuff out of New York. Blondie “Rapture” changed the game. People have got to realise that, Blondie - Rapture, that was a serious tune man, and it changed a lot of stuff. And he played me Blondie - “Rapture”, and I was like, “What is this? This tune sounds so gay! What is this, man?” And he took me to a few club and stuff and I got the whole electronic vibe because I was a real staunch music man and I just didn’t believe in the whole electronic movement of the late ‘80s. The only place you could listen to hi-NRG was at gay clubs so we started hitting gay clubs and stuff. There was a gay club down the road from me called The Fridge in Brixton, these guys called Boilerhouse they used to play there, and they used to play crazy stuff like New Order the New Romantic stuff which was like Visage and stuff like that, and I just really got into that stuff. Amylnitrate helped. And then before you knew it the whole house and techno explosion started, that was just the natural progression, really. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Everyone knows about The Loft and Fire Island and all these legendary places in New York, they’re well documented, but what was gay club culture on the beginning of the ‘80s like as far as you could see it as an outsider? Fabio It was exciting. There was a club called the Mud Club, which was run by a guy called Leigh Bowery who was instrumental to the whole club happenings in London. And we used to go out there, that used to be a crazy place because you’d have ghetto kids, new romantics used to go there, Boy George, George Michael used to go there. I used to go there, and you just had this crazy mixture of people that just had this longing for electronic music. Not like it is now where you get this kind of segregation, “I’m into Drum & bass, I’m into techno, I’m into this, I’m into that,” sub genres and ridiculous things like that. W§e were just going there and jamming and it was so exciting. So the gay scene in the States, it was just as important in the UK. They were willing to take risks that normal clubs weren’t willing to take, musically. And people-wise as well, there was a snobbery in London in the ‘80s about clubbing. And the gay scene just didn’t adhere to that at all, didn’t care about the whole VIP thing, whatever you looked like didn’t give a shit, you could just come in there and party. So that’s what I found so infectious about the whole gay scene it was very special, a very special time. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Up until a certain revival a couple of years ago, when you looked at club pictures from London from the early ‘80s, like early Face magazine, it didn’t really look as if it was about having a good time. There was a bit of make up and posing and all that? Fabio You had the fashionistas but it wasn’t really like it is now. I find the whole VIP fashion thing now it’s not about music at all. Then it was, and that’s what was exciting because a lot of influential artists of the ‘80s did go to those clubs. You had Trevor Horn going to that place, Trevor Horn to me is a pioneer of that big, big sound that I’ve always loved since I was a child. Following on from producers like Norman Whitfield, who used to produce the Temptations, and Quincy Jones, the Mizell Brothers. And Trevor Horn had that big stringy kind of sound. And Frankie Goes to Hollywood are seminal to a lot of what was going on as well. “Two Tribes” and stuff like that. So it was exciting because you didn’t really know. It wasn’t black, it wasn’t a black sound, it was just this London thing. It was exclusively London. And it wasn’t just fashion. I think The Face has always been slightly shallow anyway so they were just taking pictures of people with red hair and stuff. Beneath that there was some good shit going on. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Before we get into the favourite subject of any good British DJ, slagging off the press, it’s funny how celebrity culture these days tries to emulate that subculture. Fabio That’s the good thing about drum & bass. Drum & bass gets tagged with this thing of not being trendy enough and it’s this odd music that nobody gets, which I really like. Because in London you’ve got this crazy, VIP, celebrity bullshit thing where you go to clubs and there’s footballers and you play silly music. That VIP thing was never like that in the ‘80s, it was always about music. Now it’s not so much about music. Drum & bass is quite grimy, you wear whatever you want, it’s not about Gucci or Prada, it’s quite freestyle. I love that. It has its phases but that’s because it gets trendy all of a sudden and everyone thinks, “Oh yeah, drum & bass, really trendy let’s go and check it out.” TORSTEN SCHMIDT Where did a place like Crackers fit in? Fabio When I was about 12 my cousin was really into the soul scene and she took me to this place called Crackers, which you had to be 18 to get in to but I was a tall guy and I used to sneak in there. It used to be on a Friday afternoon from 12 until 3. Everyone was working. It was a small club with this guy called George Power playing and another icon of mine, Paul Anderson, and he used to play the most amazing soul and funk stuff, Roy Ayers, Earth, Wind & Fire, stuff I was really into at the time. But I went to school in Brixton where it was all about reggae so I always hid the fact I went to Crackers. I never really told anyone otherwise I would have got beaten up because soul was like, “Nah, nah, you don’t listen to soul, you’ve got to listen to reggae.” At school I was listening to Steel Pulse and Dennis Brown and stuff like that. On a Friday I used to go and check out funk stuff with my cousin, wear my little waistcoat and my patent shoes and go and watch these amazing dancers go crazy to the latest funk stuff. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So you had parallel lives then? Fabio I had parallel lives. My secret identity was soul music and no one ever knew because I just hid it from everyone that I was the soul boy and I was the rude boy at school. I was listening to all the pre-releases, and that helped the whole thing, my whole musical heritage. I’m pleased it went that way, really. TORSTEN SCHMIDT For us that’s about as far away as ‘14/’18 and Flanders, why couldn’t you be a soul boy and a rude boy at the same time at school? Fabio It was peer pressure. Being in school you couldn’t really be a rude boy if you liked soul music. It wasn’t rebellion. Reggae music in the ‘70s talked about struggling and pain and a lot of what was going on in Jamaica at the time, which was a lot of bullshit with the government. At election time they used to get guys from the ghetto and fight the opposition parties and stuff so it was very rebellious, very ghetto. You know, it was “Police And Thieves,” Junior Marvin, and stuff like that. That’s what it was about so it was very street at the time. But soul music was about love and people didn’t really want to hear about that. They didn’t really want to hear about people talking about going out and partying at the disco. TORSTEN SCHMIDT But there was a lot of subversive elements and political agendas in the soul movement? Fabio The thing is about soul it was still about dancing whatever message there was in that music we never heard it because it was all about dancing and that’s why disco was not political at all. Disco was… it is what it is. You go and dance and Donna Summer singing some airy fairy shot but we didn’t care, you go on the dancefloor and you leave your cares behind as Chic said. That’s what it was about, total escapism, where reggae music wasn’t. It was about how I was living at the time in Brixton, it was very similar to what was happening in Brixton at the time so it wasn’t much of an escapism. I found soul music more as a kind of fancy thing and more of an escape. Girls and all that kind of stuff. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So going back a little further to your When Harry Met Sally-moment, when did you meet your Statler? You can’t hardly say Fabio without saying another name too. Fabio How did I come up with the name Fabio? TORSTEN SCHMIDT That as well. Fabio I was going out with this lovely, lovely looking Italian girl and she always said, “If we have babies I want it to be called Fabio.” “Ok, that’s cool, I love that name.” So what happened - Colin Dale came into this as well - there was a pirate station starting up and Colin Dale was meant to do a show and he pulled out at the last moment because Kiss FM in London was just starting up so he was like, “Listen, can you do this show for me?” I said, “Sure, no problem.” So I went down and got a basket full of records and went down to this pirate station, knocked on the door, walked in, and ten minutes beforehand he said, “Listen, you need a name.” And I said, “OK, what about Fabio?” And everybody started laughing. “What do you mean, Fabio? You’re a black guy from Brixton, Fabio doesn’t suit the bill, what about Pablo?” And I was like, “Yeah, cool, but nah, nah, Fabio, it’s just got a ring to it.” And that’s how it started. That’s another thing, having two different names it’s like I’m a different person when I’m Fabio. My real name is Fitzroy. When I’m Fitzroy I’m a totally different person. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When did you first see the Fabio that was a weird kind of modeling dude? Fabio Oh, straight away. Someone came up to me but it was too late to change it. Haven’t had any calls from him or anything, it’s never been a problem. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Why did Colin have to pull out? Fabio At the time, the whole pirate thing was just really starting off with the advent of rare groove. Everyone started to get into the whole rare groove, warehouse party thing and Kiss FM had DJs like Norman Jay, Bobby and Steve and guys like that, and Colin was like: “Well, it’s established. I’d rather go here than some new pirate station starting up with nameless DJs.” So Colin started to go to Kiss FM. I became one of the nameless DJs and we had some good DJs come out of there. Dave Angel was on Phase One, the station I was on, Pressure Drop, these guys that were really instrumental in the first early beats stuff and stuff like that. It was a very influential time, we’re talking about 1984/’85. I started off playing really way out rare groove stuff, stuff like early Blackbyrds, crazy stuff coming out of New York like Moody, crazy electronic stuff. But there was one specific day, I went to the record shop and bought “My Melody” by Eric B and Rakim and “Mysteries Of Love” by Fingers Inc. on the same day. And that day changed my life. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What shop was it? Fabio Red Records in Brixton. And those two tunes changed everything for me. My Melody was the start of real hip hop. Eric B and Rakim, Rakim probably the greatest rapper of all time, and ‘Mysteries Of Love,’ which was Fingers Inc., was the first real house tune that I heard out if Chicago so I’ll always remember that day. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Wasn’t it odd that someone who had to live parallel lives a couple of years earlier with these scenes which were so far apart, that on that day you got these two records, which are two a lot of people millions of universes apart but are so close to everyone in this room because they convey a lot of similarities? Fabio When I heard Rakim rap for the first time I was like: “Damn, this guy.” You know, rap before then was Sugarhill Gang and stuff like that it wasn’t really… Rakim just came with these metaphors and Eric B was an incredibly underrated producer, just came with these sick rhythms and sick beats. And “Mysteries Of Love”, which of course, guys like Robert Owens, who I think is the most underrated vocalist of all time, and Larry Heard, who is a total genius, to get those two tunes on the same day was just like a turning point. I think it was fate. You get those moments in your life where it’s like a blueprint. I could have gone either way. I was really into hip hop a lot. I was into KRS-One and stuff like that but there was not a club scene as such. Whereas the house thing had just started up and it was so exciting and so exhilarating and I chose that path. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Did you feel liberated that suddenly Fabio and Fitzroy could be the same person and play the same stuff that they liked within 15 minutes of a set? Fabio For me, DJing in the early days was never fun, I used to be so nervous about DJing. Nosebleeds and stuff like that. The first DJ set I ever played was in a place called Gossips with Tim Westwood, who’s now the king of UK hip hop. He gave me a slot. I was a dancer, I used to be what they called a ‘boogie boy’. We used to go to clubs and dance, basically to get girls. But we never used to, because we used to end up so sweaty and so into the music that by the time we’d finished dancing all the girls had gone home so it was a pointless exercise, really. One day Colin, again, he didn’t turn up for a gig and Tim phoned up and said, “Listen, Fitz. I know you’ve got records, come down and spin some tunes.” And that was stuff like Change, I was into Change, the group from the US, “Glow Of Love” by Luther Vandross and stuff like that. Chic, I loved all that kind of stuff. And I went down there and played and I was so, so nervous I thought there’s no way I could ever do this for a living. I just couldn’t do it, I preferred to be a dancer and just go out there chasing girls all the time. So the DJ thing never clicked for me but it was an important moment because it showed me what it was all about. DJing clicked for me with pirate radio. TORSTEN SCHMIDT On that particular phone call, how many [does Tim Westwood impression] “exactlys” were there? What was Tim like at the time? Fabio Tim was cool. Tim has got this thing where, if you don’t know he’s the real founder of hip hop in the UK. This 52 year-old white guy whose father was a bishop, but talks black. I mean, he is the most ghetto speaking guy. I don’t even understand what he’s talking about sometimes. But he’s always been a real important person when it comes to black music in England and he was a wicked soul DJ. He used to phone me up and be like, “Listen, Fitz, I’ve just got this wicked tune in, this new Roy Ayers thing, what track should I play? “Cameo. Oh, Cameo. Cameo, Cameo, Cameo. I loved Cameo.” I used to be his ghostwriter in a funny sort of way, I used to tell him what tracks to play. He’d never admit that now if you were to speak to him but I did, and so he was like, “Come and play some music.” And I did well, I did well. And another thing, there was no mixing in those days it was all about selection, which to me is still the most important part about playing music. You can have all the technology you want, Final Scratch, whatever it is, Ableton Live, if you can’t put two tunes together none of that matters, it really doesn’t. You can be the best mixer in the world. I used to listen to Jah Shaka, who to me is one of the greatest DJs of all time, and he still plays with one deck, which is belt-drive. It’s not even like, you can’t do that [mimes touching deck]. You’ve got to push it in. And he makes people dance because he’s a selector. He can put two tunes together, which to me is still the most important thing. Selection, man. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you speak of selection, the rare groove thing got out of hand as well. Especially the ‘rare’ bit in it. Fabio It’s been through so many different phases. The whole rare groove thing was really exciting because, we were kicking off warehouses, we’d go to a warehouse in the middle of London and break in and set up a soundsystem and play music. And you had guys like Jazzie B, another guy who is totally underrated, he put British music on the map. He gave British black music an identity. Guys like that were starting out, Trevor Nelson, Norman, Gilles Peterson, Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold, all those guys were all just coming up at that time, it was amazing to see that at the time. The police were chasing us as well, they used to raid these warehouses on a regular basis and we didn’t care. There was just that feeling, that buzz that something new was happening. And then Colin took me to listen to Derrick May and Blake Baxter. That seriously changed my life. Derrick May, the guy’s just such a genius. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What was so different about it? Fabio It was electronic music that was beautiful music. Before that electronic music was still quite - don’t get me wrong, I love New Order and stuff like that - but I never saw the beauty in electronic music. I didn’t think electronic music could ever sound like Marvin Gaye and Stevie and these guys and when I heard Derrick May and Blake Baxter play they had these amazing strings and pads and it all just made sense to me. It had so much soul, it had so much rhythm. And I just thought, ‘These guys are from Detroit which is the scariest place that I’ve ever been to in my life. It’s so industrial, it’s so bleak, and they can make music that sounds like this’. It just made me know that electronic music had that thing, that timeless quality. TORSTEN SCHMIDT How did that fusion of the rare groove thing and the electronic thing happen? Fabio It happened strangely enough because the ethos of breaking in and being a bit of a rebel didn’t quite suit rare groove. Rare groove isn’t rebellious enough and when dance music came along, this whole thing, it just came along and came through with this drug-fuelled energy. It was different, it felt more like, ‘This is what warehouses were made for’, and it was an incredible time. I remember listening to Paul Oakenfold at place called Spectrum, Heaven in London and just looking up and seeing all these lasers for the first time. I’d never seen lasers before and people just looking up to him like he was a god. DJs never really had that status. DJs were still someone playing music, you never knew who it was, it was this little guy in the corner and then it just turned DJing onto something totally different. And I remember him playing Yello “The Race”, [sings Yello “The Race”) and I remember the whole crowd just putting their hands up and looking towards the DJ and I found myself doing the same thing and I just thought, ‘Shit, this is what I want to do. This is really what I want to do’. The power that’s there… and you couldn’t even see him you could just see this silhouette and it was like church. It was like praying to some god. I thought, ‘This is me, I want this, man’. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Because of the god-like element or the moment when you had your hands up? Fabio Both. Not wanting to feel like a god but to have that power of people with music, something that I’d loved all my life, to see it affect people in that way. Yeah, I wanted to do that. You can get that in the form of live bands but not with a guy with decks. These things are another thing that changed everything [points to the turntable], Technics. When I saw the the power that this shit had I was like ‘Woah’. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What is the power? Fabio Basically, the pitch and how steady it is. You’ve had millions, Vestax and everyone’s made decks but these are still the blueprint. It’s amazing, I went with my daughter to Science Museum in London and they had this archive and they had a pair of Technics decks there and they were like, “This is what DJs used to play with in the ‘80s and ‘90s.” And I was like, “What a cheek! I’m still playing with this shit now.” It made me feel a bit like technology has taken over a bit. I still play a lot of vinyl, dubplates and stuff. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Are these moments when you feel like a dinosaur, like a relic from another time? Fabio Yeah, I do slightly. I only got my first computer two years ago, my first mobile phone four years ago. I’m a bit scared of technology, there’s something quite scary about it. The speed of it I don’t like. I don’t like that you can just get in contact with people so quickly and get things done so quickly. I think it takes away a lot of brain power. I do feel a bit like that. Even just having a Mac. I bought my first Mac last week, I had a PC that got ravaged by viruses. Everyone was like, “What you doing with a fucking PC? Get a Mac.” And I was like, “Listen, I don’t give a shit.” As long as I can get online and send an email. But now I’ve got into the Mac thing I see what everyone’s talking about. And that’s what happens with technology. You get into something you don’t want to and then you get drawn into it so much, and before you know it, you’re some techno freak, man. It scares me slightly. But even MySpace. Everyone was like, “Fabio, you need to get on MySpace, it’s what’s happening, you need it.” And I’m still not on MySpace because I hate it. All I see on MySpace is naked people trying to fucking get off with each other (laughter). And then it’s under this banner that, oh yeah, it’s so cool, we want to get our music across to people, it’s bullshit. My girlfriend and I had a big problem because I looked in her MySpace page and saw all these naked men. I was like, “What the fuck are you doing?” (laughs) “Who the fuck’s this?” And she’s like, “Oh, they’re my friends.” And I was like, “Do you need naked friends?” (applause) Six months time I’ll probably be half naked on MySpace as well. That’s what I mean about technology you just got to be there. Torsten Schmidt That’s where technology interferes with psychology as well. Do you think that the overall peer pressure of the Internet high school popularity contest, you looking on there and going, “Oh, hang on, my girlfriend’s looking at this and his chest is a little wider than mine and I need to get the angles.” Fabio Yeah for sure, it’s the new gym. Torsten Schimdt Shouldn’t you be old and bold and brave enough to set the stage and go like, “Pff?” Fabio No, no, no. I’m too insecure for that. I’m still very insecure about everything that I do. I’m not a confident person in a lot of ways. No, no, no. I’ll never feel confident with technology, even the CD thing, I’m freaking out because of a crash and something’s going to go wrong and stuff like that. Then, at the same time, I do appreciate that this is the way it is. Big case in point, drum & bass is very techno based and Grooverider is using Serato Scratch and he’s now getting everybody to say, “Why do you do it, now you’re killing vinyl,” and it’s like, well he’s like me but he’s like, “Well, this is the future man.” You can’t be traditionalist about everything. I think that just stops progress. It’s just me, I just find... I take a long time to get into stuff but then when I get into it I dismiss everything else. It’s just me man. It’s a Libra thing. Torsten Schmidt Wasn’t one of the pit falls of drum & bass in the first place that it championed progress so much that it’s somehow hindered itself from a healthy progress? Fabio Yes and no. I think drum & bass’ biggest problem is that it became a trend thing. A lot of people were saying that they were into it that weren’t really into it. It was just a phase that they went through. Drum & bass’ problem is it doesn’t really conform enough in a funny sort of way. It keep itself to itself slightly, which I don’t always think is a good thing. At the same time it’s kept it real and it’s... Torsten Schmidt Real as in? Fabio It hasn’t changed that much man. It’s never really sold itself to the world, not like hip-hop has. When I look at hip-hop and I see, people will say, “Drum & bass has been around a long time, maybe we’ll get to the stage hip-hop got to,” and I’m like, “Well, do you want to get to that phase?” The realest hip-hop, for me, is just underground and no one in America really, really wants to listen to it because they’d prefer to listen to Jay-Z coming back again after he retired like four months ago or something, which pissed me off because I sat down and told myself, “Jay-Z, you’re retiring but you’ve got... There’s so much things you could say to the kids, man. There’s so much things instead of thinking, well I’ve said enough about bitches and crystal so I’m going to give up.” I’m pissed off with that man and I’m glad drum & bass will never go down that road because it can’t go down that road, it never will. Torsten Schmidt What do you think drum & bass has got to say to the kids? Fabio Nothing, really. I don’t think it says anything. You either like it or you don’t like it, you dance to it or you don’t dance to it, man. Do you know what I mean? I don’t think it’s really got that much to say because it’s a very rhythm-based as well which is another reason why a lot of people can’t get their head... It hasn’t got any hooks, very... It’s quite monotonous. It hasn’t really got a lot of melody, these kind of... My sister just reckons it sounds like a car rolling backwards down a hill. That’s what she said it sounds like to her and I know a lot of people can’t really get their heads around it. Torsten Schmidt You’ve been always known as one of the DJ’s in the game that liked the harmonies and the melodies and that kind of stuff. Fabio I try and bring that. It’s hard right now, it’s hard because every time I do that something else comes along, like Pendulum. Pendulum’s coming out which... They’re great, I love Pendulum, absolutely love them. Torsten Schmidt Are you just saying that because you feel you have to say that? Fabio No, no. I’m saying that because, sonically I think they’re amazing and I think they are the first drum & bass group since The Prodigy that can take it onto a massive stage and sound incredible. On a stage of 40,000 people they will sound amazing. No, no, no, I’ve got total respect for Pendulum, total respect, totally, just like I had respect for Prodigy back in the day. I loved Prodigy, the early stuff. Torsten Schmidt That’s exactly the same kind of thing with the Pendulum thing. At what price are you playing to 40,000, 400,000 people? Can you give us a run down of what an early Prodigy show looked like? Fabio Early Prodigy was crazy because we used to be playing a lot of soulful breakbeat-y stuff and Prodigy used to come on with this kind of punk attitude. They just had something, there was like Utah Saints around at the time, Aphex Twin, Orbital, Leftfield, but Prodigy just had the game sewn up in the live element. They had this amazing live show with so much energy, so much creativity as well, they were very creative, Prodigy. I think that people underestimate the skill Liam) had in producing stuff like “Firestarter”. He moved from “Charly”, which was this ridiculous record about a cartoon character, to Firestarter in one fell swoop and that took amazing skill and courage to do that. So total respect to them, total respect. TORSTEN SCHMIDT By the time the Prodigy came ‘round the first time you already had gone through how many lives? Fabio A lot, because then, going back to ‘88, Drum & bass wasn’t around so we played techno. A lot of techno like R&S. I played “Mentasm” on dubplate, ‘92/’93. Joey Beltram actually came down and gave me an acetate of it. I’m so proud of that moment. In ‘88 it was Chicago house, acid house, and bones breaks, Frankie Bones from New York, Little Louie Vega, the whole New York sound was incredible, Frankie Knuckles, stuff like that. And then at the same time there was a lot of balearic stuff going on as well. Balearic is the original Ibiza music, very guitar-y, quite druggy stuff. Which I liked as well, I loved balearic stuff but I was really into the Chicago [sound], Farley ‘Jackmaster’ Funk, them cats there, man, they were the real dudes at the time for me. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When did that whole thing get out of hand, that early warehouse scene? Fabio When the press, the national press got on the whole drug thing. There was a story about a big rave called Sunrise. They broke into some fields and there was 35,000 people illegally dancing on the most beautiful day ever in England, it was a beautiful day and night. And the press came down and it was on the front page of the newspapers the next morning that this 30,000 frenzied kids had gone on the rampage in some fields and taken ecstasy. There was ecstasy wrappers found on the floor, foils with ecstasy in them, no one really understood. The great thing about the rave movement was the first time black and white people came together as a kind of movement, it never really happened before. The soul scene is very black, Crackers was very black, it was 95% black, and you had your kind of punk/mod scenes, which was very white. I know it sounds really superficial, really clichéd - but there really wasn’t no colour, we really looked at white people and Asian people as one family. TORSTEN SCHMIDT And once you’d drunk from the same water bottle... Fabio Yeah, that’s right. Once you drank from the same water bottle that was it and those were the days, very exciting times. But it got shut down basically because the government came up with this bill called the Criminal Justice Bill, which stopped you from doing any parties in a field. They just rushed this bill through which was totally illegal for them to do it and there was riots in London about it, a lot of protests and stuff. And then it went into clubs and a lot of people thought it’d be sanitised and it was the end of everything. The end of dance music. And it survived, man. It survived, it survived. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you think back to the riots the Criminal Justice Bill caused and the media outrage and stuff, and when you think of the deprivation of public and personal rights we’re facing nowadays, especially in England with CCTV and whatnot, how do you feel about that in comparison? Fabio We felt cheated and we were governed by a woman called Mrs. Thatcher who was the common enemy and we just felt that she was so against young people and their ideals and what they wanted to do and she was getting more and more right wing and suppressing. It was very depressing times and that’s why I think acid house was so relevant. She shut down all the mills in the North of England and everyone just felt like it was... The country was slowly getting shut down and raving was such an escape for everyone. And drugs was as well, let’s get it straight. Acid and ecstasy was a major part of what was going on at the time. People used to take so much drugs to get away from the drudgery of what was going on and she was out a little while after that anyway. The Criminal Justice Bill was one of the things that got her out. The Poll Tax, which was an extraordinary bill that they tried to pass through government, that and the Criminal Justice Bill helped to get her out so we helped change things. That’s the way I see it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you look at the open public outrage at that time, what is going on currently, where is the open resistance movement in England in the last three or four years or whatever? Fabio It’s not happening because the lines have been blurred politically for me. All England really cares about is terrorism and we’re getting kind of flummoxed with this phony war on terror. But I think the youth nowadays just haven’t got it in them to be rebellious. I think everyone’s too content in a funny sort of way, they’re quite happy with what’s going on. English people aren’t really rebellious by nature anyway. They don’t really stand up and do anything about things, unless it directly affects them, and so I don’t see anything changing at all. The more politics gets a stranglehold on everything we do, the less chance there is of any revolution of any kind. I don’t think it’s going to happen anywhere. Western society, we’ve become very fragile and very... We don’t like the government but we sit down and as long as it doesn’t affect you, you don’t give a shit. You’re too interested in looking after your kids and stuff like that. I’ve got two daughters, I can’t be a rebel now, I’m too old. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What position does that leave us as musicians, producers, DJs and stuff? Fabio Music’s always free, though. Music’s always your way out, your escape. You can say what you want through music. You can do what you want through music so that’s cool, music’s always real. In bad times music always thrives and that’s why I think now, we’re going through a great music phase at the moment, I think there’s some wonderful music around in all genres. I think house music’s got itself together again, I think there’s some great techno stuff, great underground hip-hop, great UK hip-hop, which took a little while but it’s there now and is going to shake the whole American thing up. UK grime and stuff like that. Someone said to me the other day that there’s this thing in England, I don’t know if it happens out here, called happy slapping, where you go around and you slap people in the face and record it. And someone said to me that’s because kids are bored and that’s actually very inventive that they’re thinking of new ways of doing shit. And I thought it was bullshit at first but in a funny sort of way it’s true, they’re using technology and making their own little movies out of [it], their own little snuff movies. And happy slapping’s big stuff, it happens all the time. It’s never happened to me, but kids are bored, that’s why they do shit like that and record it. They mug people and record it and that’s invention for them, that’s them producing and directing. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When does boredom become a creative force? Fabio It depends. If you get too bored, I don’t think you can be creative. I think if you’re bored and you’ve got passion and you’re slightly focused, I think you can do shit. I think if you’re just bored and lazy, you’re not going to get anywhere. Times are so rough now and things are so bad and people are so disillusioned, people are turning to the music and there was a time when people were just not really into music. London goes through phases. London two years ago, techno died, house died, drum & bass died, but now everything’s thriving again because all we hear about is bullshit about the war on terror and shit like that. I think in times like that music always thrives. TORSTEN SCHMIDT It’s been in human nature to always complain about the youth being lazy, even if you go back to Socrates and whatnot, and now with you being on this whole music thing for like, I don’t know, a long time, what’s your trick to overcome the laziness? What’s the stick-up’s you give people? Fabio My biggest thing is age. I’m in my early forties now and it’s just keeping young. That’s what keeps me focused. I play in some places where I could be the grandfather to a lot of the kids who are in there, it makes me think sometimes, ‘Wow, this is weird’. And then, other times I think it’s just great because it’s keeping me in the young thing. When I was younger, if you were 40, you were old. I looked at you as very conservative, did your thing, and now if you’re 40, I go to clubs and I’m kind of the youngest guy in there, so that’s cool. It’s changed, being old now. In the music game anyway it doesn’t matter. John Peel, who was one of our greatest DJs, he always said to me, “Listen, just have fun. Don’t ever take it too seriously, don’t analyse things too much, don’t think about social issues, it’s music and your love for music.” When I was 14 I used to love black music so much but the only chance I could hear it was on a pirate radio called Radio Luxembourg. And I used to have a transistor radio that I used to listen to under my pillow because my mum always used to check if I was awake or not and I used to listen to the charts on a Sunday night with a guy called Tony Prince and he used to play the top 30 American tunes and that was wicked, man. Now, that in a way was kind of improvising. Now, because of technology, you don’t have to improvise. Things are too easy that’s what I mean about... I got that passion because it was difficult to stay up at 11 o’clock and hear that shit and I used to listen to it and a lot of times it used to crackle and it used to go off and I used to wait for it to come back on and I used to miss a couple of the tracks and now you can get everything on digital straight away and you can hear whatever you want to hear. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Are you romanticising it or are you thinking that stuff’s too easy to get hold of? Fabio A bit of both. But there’s something really sweet and innocent about that, 11 o’clock you’re listening to some ship out in Europe fucking broadcasting music. And it’s illegal as well, it was an illegal station, you could just about hear it, and just something warm about that that you can’t have nowadays. There’s nothing you can’t hear, there’s nothing you can’t do, there’s nothing you can’t see. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So you think something like Rinse FM doesn’t have that kind of warmth? Fabio No, because it’s very knowing. You know people are listening to you out there. I think them guys didn’t even know if people were listening to them. They were on this ship and they didn’t even know that this little guy in Brixton was sitting down listening to their... TORSTEN SCHMIDT But with about 800 million different radio stations no one knows if anyone’s listening too, right? Fabio For sure, that’s true, but there always is someone listening, there always is. People find shit whereas before, I don’t know. Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m wrong. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Did you ever feel like you were taking away the job or the opportunity from some passionate 14 year-old kid from Brixton to turn their habit into a job? Fabio No, no, no. I never feel like that because if you’re good enough you’ll make it. I don’t ever sympathise with anyone and think that I’ve stopped anyone’s progress. I just don’t think that’s the way it is. When people say, “You’re stopping a lot of the young guys coming through,” well, so what? At the end of the day, I’m there to be knocked down. So if you’re good enough, you’ll make it and that’s the truth. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Good enough is one thing, having the long breath another thing, especially when it comes to residencies. There’s a lot of crews and kids who go there and start out the club and the first night only ten people turn up, the second night twenty people turn up and they just go, “OK, no-one wants to listen to us.” Fabio We started a club called Speed in 1993 with LTJ Bukem because I was really pissed off with the way drum & bass was going. There was a lot of really ragga jungle which was wicked but was bringing totally the wrong crowd. A lot of people getting shot in clubs, and I was thinking, ‘This isn’t for me’. So we found a club in the West End and we decided to do that and for the first four weeks we had the total of about 40 people in there. We kept on and within three months it had got huge. I was hearing Tony Wilson, who was an important guy in the whole Manchester scene, the whole Happy Mondays and stuff, saying the first night he launched his club the Stone Roses was playing in this little bar with 20 of his friends there and them never knowing if more people are going to come. If you’ve got something like that maybe it’s because you’re doing something everyone else is doing, maybe you should try and do something that’s a little bit leftfield, something a little bit different. But I do my night on a Wednesday and sometimes there’s no one in there at all. TORSTEN SCHMIDT You did pick the odd day not the Friday? Fabio For sure, because I think in the week people are more tuned in to music. On a Wednesday night you’re a music person. You don’t go out on a Wednesday night to get out of it and drink loads, it’s a music night, it’s quite chilled. Thursday nights as well, which is now a weekend-ish kind of night. When we started off Speed on a Thursday night everyone was like, “One, it’s not going to work because it’s Thursday. Secondly, Drum & bass is never going to work in the West End and third, you’re trying this soulful kind of Drum & bass thing, that ain’t gonna work, no one wants to listen to it.” So on all these levels we went against the grain, which is great. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Do you think the demographic of club nights on a work day is changing because of more people being out of jobs? Fabio Yeah, but I also think the fact that people do know that weekends have just become quite mainstream, clubbing has become quite mainstream and I think real music people are going out in the week, weekdays, regardless of going to work. I mean, we finish Swerve, which is my club in the West End on a Wednesday night, at three. A good friend of mine comes down every week, he takes two busses home and he takes two busses to work and I love that, he wouldn’t miss it for the world. It doesn’t matter how tired he is, he’s there every week and you don’t really get that at weekends, you don’t get that real feel. So the weekdays have always been great for me. I love DJing on a Wednesday night man, it’s just so cool. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What about Sunday nights? Fabio Cool. Blue Note in London was probably the most famous drum & bass night. It was crazy, used to finish at 12, Goldie’s night. That was mad, that was a mad, mad, mad time. Very punk, very electric, Grooverider used to play there. It was the start of really dark drum & bass, the whole dark drum & bass movement with Ed Rush and them guys, that started at Blue Note. I was kind of resident there as well. Residencies are very important to me, it kept my people with me all the way and because I play a slightly different form of Drum & bass it’s kept my crowd happy and a lot of those people that come to Swerve don’t necessarily go out to other Drum & bass nights. It’s great, I’d always do a residency midweek, always. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So when it comes to building up these things, you’re always building up ‘your people’, and you have to turn yourself into some kind of trademark. How important is the MC in that? Fabio Well, I don’t have MCs in my club on a Wednesday. Not because of any reason but I just want the DJs to come down there. I think DJs can hide behind MCs a lot sometimes. You get MCs that are so skilled you can be shit and get away with it. Down at Swerve they don’t have MCs, you’ve got to rely on your musical skill and your musical knowledge and getting your way around playing a good selection. So I don’t have MCs. But MCs play an important role because Drum & bass is very rhythm/track-based. They put the kind of sugar on the cake, they make it understandable to everybody. TORSTEN SCHMIDT It took you a while to get to this point to be able to do that but on a Sunday night in ‘91 or ‘92 in some Ealing warehouse you needed to have the MCs. Fabio Oh yeah, you do. [In] drum & bass still you do need an MC a lot of the time because you have to have someone to interpret the music, they’re kind of like interpreters in a funny sort of way. Japanese clubs as well, it’s great to have an MC. Even though they don’t know what you’re talking about they pick up that vibe and there’s a voice there so they can follow it. It’s great like that, but then there’s other times they’re a slight intrusion and if you get an MC that thinks he’s a bit more important than you are you have slight problem there. TORSTEN SCHMIDT What’s the harshest thing you ever had to do to an MC? Fabio A lot of the time I just plug the mic out or turn the fader down or just tell him to piss off, basically. Which is always a good way, that one always works. But unless he’s really awful I just say, “Listen, it’s not going with what I’m doing, so…” TORSTEN SCHMIDT At a night like Swerve what do you incorporate there from the things that you learnt at nights like Mendoza’s? Fabio It’s still the same. I’ve still got the same ethic behind what I do. It’s still the same kind of soulful feeling that’s always been with me whatever music I’ve played. It’s always got to have that sense of rhythm and that soulfulness, that vibe, I just try and maintain that. A lot of drum & bass is very - harsh isn’t the word - but it’s very hard. I don’t really like soulless music so much and a lot of it can sound like a cacophony of noise. I try and make it sound like it’s got some kind of structure a bit more. But saying that I do, I love a lot of hard Drum & bass as well. I love what Dillinja does, I think he’s a real scientist. Photek, and another thing, we mustn’t underrate producers like Photek who was the template for producers like Timbaland. Timbaland’s gone on record as saying he’s listened to Photek and learnt loads from him and even the way, the little shuffles you get nowadays in hip-hop, you listen to hip hop eight years ago and you listen to it now, the way they use their snares slightly differently, the way they shuffle their hi-hat’s around. A lot of that does come from drum & bass and I think drum & bass does get a bad rep. I mean, garage music, which was supposed to have killed off drum & bass was a hybrid of Drum & bass. Garage music was made by Drum & bass producers that got pissed off with the fact that drum & bass went a bit too technical and wanted to get back to more natural sounds and that’s how garage came around. So drum & bass is very important and I think it gets overlooked a hell of a lot of the time. A lot of the patterns that’s in the drums, you can hear it in a lot of music nowadays. You can hear it in R&B, you can hear it in hip hop, you can hear it in a lot of what Timbaland does, you can hear it in a lot of what The Neptunes do, so I think people [underestimate Drum & bass]. TORSTEN SCHMIDT For a lot of people it was the back alley for finally being politically correct to admit to like certain electronic music, thinking if you liked your funkiness and soul and that’s how it was probably OK for the hip hop crowd to admit they liked the electronic side of things. Fabio For sure. Drum & bass is the most electronic music you can get. What’s changed with Drum & bass more than anything else is the speed. Drum & bass is still maybe too fast, it’s running at 175. Maybe if you slowed it down to 160 you’d lose a lot of that kind of clowny vibe you get with Drum & bass sometimes. I think sometimes the speed gives it that effect of being ploddy and [does bassline impression], it’s a lot more complex than that. So if I think drum & bass needs to learn something, I think it does need to slow down a bit. I’m as susceptible as anyone else, when I play sometimes you just get the thing to pitch up to +6 and then you listen back to it and think, ‘Shit, that’s going way too fast’. So I think it does need to slow down a bit. TORSTEN SCHMIDT That’s maybe not bad thing in general to slow down a bit here and there. Fabio I just think it’ll sound slightly more warm. But we had a big discussion, the whole Drum & bass fraternity about that, so I think a lot of the guys will be slowing it down. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Was that in one of those secret meetings that you guys have? Fabio We do. It’s like the Freemasons and it’s quite Nazi-esque. We all sit down there and plan our changes but it never happens though. We all walk away and think, ‘Fuck that!’ It never happens. There was a big meeting once about what we were doing with speed, there was a big meeting with all the guys. They had this secret meeting and they were like, “Oh, you know, they’re bringing drum & bass to the West End...,” and drum & bass is very strange like that, if they don’t like things they have meetings and they try and oust you. Have coups and stuff. So they had this big thing about the West End, “We don’t want it to go to the West End. Fabio, Bukem, they’re selling it out,” which did hurt quite a lot at the time because a lot of these guys were friends of mine. But it never happened, it never does really. Drum & bass people are long, they take ages to do anything. So you never have to worry about the meetings. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So meetings, fraternities and stuff, and going back to Mendoza’s, you can’t really talk about you without mentioning your sibling or your brother in crime. Fabio Oh, Grooverider? Oh, Grooverider, man. Grooverider’s been great for me because I’m very lazy and he’s so focused. It is really like a yin and yang thing. He’s totally the opposite for me but he’s been a total inspiration, he’s been as inspirational as people like Derrick May has, anybody. Incredible DJ, incredible, man, great friend. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him and that’s being serious. TORSTEN SCHMIDT How do you keep a working friendship over so many years? FABIO We don’t really see each other that much, which is good. If you ever want to keep a friendship, don’t socialize that much. We don’t socialize that much, man. We’ve got our own thing going on. We’re kind of really different and at the same time we’re very similar. And he gives me my space. I don’t answer my phone a lot and stuff like that. I’m very hard to get hold of and he’s very accessible and stuff like that. He just keeps me kind of real, man. And he’s a real techno freak. He’s a real, “Oh Fabio - you need to be on MySpace, you need to be on AIM. So he keeps me up with techology. So I’ll probably be doing some other scratch thing because he’s just starting it and he’s like ‘Look man, you’ve got your two deck things and it’s wicked and it sounds like you’re playing vinyl and stuff. So he just keeps me in touch with the real world. A lot of the time... I’m a real kind of family guy and I really don’t like to be immersed in drum & bass all the time. In drum & bass, in a funny sort of way, you’ve really got to live the life so much. They don’t like you doing anything else. You’re not suposed to eat things that drum & bass people don’t eat and stuff like that. Drum & bass is very odd like that and I really don’t want to get caught up in that whole drum & bass thing, so I try and do a lot of other things and get on with not being totally obsessed with music all the time. I love football a lot. That’s a major love of mine. My team is Tottenham Hotspur. I don’t know if you know about football, but they’re the greatest team in the world. And... I love my football. Torsten Schmidt They had a great attacker once. Fabio Huh? Torsten Schmidt They had a great attacker once. Fabio Yeah. No, they’re still [inaudible]. I don’t want to go into the whole footbal thing. Don’t even get me started. I like to listen to loads of stuff. I went to... A producer of mine took me to a metal... He plays punk, metal, stuff like that, and he’s the producer of my show. He had a surprise party so I went down to this bar in Camden and listened to this band called Capdown - I don’t know if any of you guys have heard of this metal group? Crazy! Wicked, man. And I went in there and there was all kind of skull and crossbones on the walls and I was thinking “Shit, man, they’re going to be doing some... they’re going to be cutting some young virgin’s throat in the middle of the dance floor.” And it didn’t happen, man. These two rock bands came on and they were amazing. In this little room like this and they just had so much energy and so much vibes. I felt like a kid again, man, because it was music I hadn’t heard and it was just wild, man. So I love that shit. I love that nu-metal stuff that’s coming out. So I listen to a lot of that. Listening to Madlib, as well, who I’m going to go and see in London. Listen to a lot of that stuff at the moment. I love the way he produces, I love the way The Neptunes produce, a couple of years ago more than now, do you know what I mean? I’ve got mad love for J Dilla, who passed away. But he was another... you ask most drum & bass producers and they will quote J Dilla as the man. And if you listen to a lot of J Dilla’s stuff, the warmth in his music is what I try and encapsulate a lot in drum & bass. These warm b-lines, the way he used snares and stuff like that. I thought J Dilla was an incredible, incredible producer. Very underrated. So I’m listening to a lot of really early J Dilla stuff at the moment. Yeah man, I’m loving music at the moment though. I’m loving music again. A good friend of mine sent me some real good minimal techno. The whole tech house thing is great at the moment. I’m starting to feel really alive again now for the first time in a little while about the whole music thing. And coming here to the Academy and seeing what you guys are doing is great. It’s a great outlet for young guys like yourselves to experiment with shit and everyone seems really positive here and on the same page and everyone’s working and everything seems really real here. Torsten Schmidt Now, with the things you like and the position you’re in - I don’t know, the radio shows and whatnot - wouldn’t you be able to go like, “Drum & bass rules, I do my thing now and I just go home and start playing the nu-metal stuff next to the latest Dilla beat tape, next to whatever kind of thing. Would you, in your position, be able to get away with that and probably create something new on top of that. FABIO Yeah, I could, but then, you know... To me still, as a DJ, what you do has got to make sense, and to me that wouldn’t make that much sense. To me, I’ve got to have some kind of cohesion, whether it’s a good or bad thing, whether it’s kind of like being inventive or not it’s still got to sound cohesive. I don’t like... Torsten Schmidt Is there a difference between club DJing and radio DJing though? Fabio Yeah, there is. Because it’s just you and you don’t know who’s listening. When you’ve got people facing you, you tend to compromise a bit more if you see a crowd. When you don’t have anyone to dance, you know, when you don’t have to make people dance, people didn’t pay money to come and see you DJ, so it’s a different art form in that respect. You can chill a lot more. I’m a lot more relaxed on the radio as well. I’m very tense when I DJ. I don’t know why. I’ve been DJing 20 years. I’ll walk into the smallest club with no-one there and I’m like “Eurghhhh!” Which is good, because I think that’s what keeps me, that’s what keeps the whole adrenalin thing going with me, man. But radio I do love. I think it’s a great art form and it survived the advent of television and stuff like that. I still think, in a funny sort of way, it’s the most powerful medium there is. Because you don’t see that person, you’re just hearing this distracted voice coming out the speakers and there’s something about that that I still really, really love. Torsten Schmidt And in some ways the internet has breathed... Fabio New life into radio, for sure. The great thing about internet radio is that people are falling in love with radio again and really findinf out how important radio is. Torsten Schmidt And also the selecting process because with all the music out there they need someone they can trust to filter through the crap. Fabio For sure. I think even in war time radio was an assurance for a lot of people out there. When the bombs were falling and stuff like that radio was the most important thing. It made people kind of escape from the shit that was going on. Whereas I don’t feel TV does that. TV kind of draws you into that. It shows you everything. And radio’s not like that. Radio is a totally different kind of medium, man. It keeps you happy. It gives you assurances in a funny sort of way. Torsten Schmidt Also triggers your imagination. Fabio Yeah, exactly. You’ve got to use your imagination. It’s more visual than television is, in a funny sort of way. You know what I mean? You paint your own pictures, man. A lot of people were like “Oh my God, I didn’t know you were black.” And I’m like “Why?” “Because of your name and stuff.” And it’s like, “OK!” A lot of people dont know what I look and stuff like that and that’s cool. Torsten Schmidt That’s a very comfy thing in this age of... Fabio In this age of image and stuff like that. You don’t have to be good looking to DJ as well. It’s not really and image-based thing. You don’t have to look a certain way, you don’t have to eat a certain way. Torsten Schmidt As long as you stay away from MySpace. Fabio Yeah, as long as you stay away from MySpace. And Radio One is very good to me in the fact that I can play whatever I want and I can kind of do what I want. Which is very important to what I do. And, plus it’s worldwide, it’s got a huge internet following, they’re very clued up about the whole net thing, they’re on top of that kind of stuff. And they’ve kept with us for seven years, which for mainstream radio... I feel very privileged to be there for that long. It’s the pinnacle of any DJ wanting to be on the radio in England. Radio One is really the peak, you know, of your ambitions really. Torsten Schmidt When you’re at that level of professionalism, a lot of people think they would need someone called an agent. Now what exactly does an agent do? Fabio Ummmmmm...take 15%. Do you know what I mean? [laughs] Torsten Schmidt So it’s like the tax man? Fabio No no no. To be fair, agents kind of like... My girlfriend’s my agent as well. Torsten Schmidt Is that always a good combination? Fabio No, it is. No, it’s good, because she’s one of the first agents. You can’t be out there ding all that stuff and she does all the bullshit stuff. She’s there and I’ll shout at her a lot and she’s far between these egotistical DJs. It’s very hard work for her, very hard work. Especially drum & bass DJs. All the guys are so insecure and stuff. She’s like the mother. I haven’t got an agent and managers and stuff like that. I’ve never gone down these roads, it’s not really me. I’ve just got an agent and that’s it, do you know what I mean? And she does very little apart from get my work together and this kind of stuff. She doesn’t intrude. Torsten Schmidt But the whole thing is, we all like to work in an environment where we like the people that we work with, but if it’s your girlfriend on top of things and you feel like something’s not going the way you want it to... I don’t want to be you to tell her... Fabio Oh, but no no no. She listens. She listens and she knows on a professional level you’ve got to keep it like that. You’ve got to keep your relationship separate. If I say something, she’s got to take me as an outside in a funny sort of way. We’ve always established that from the very start, that if she’s not happy with things, she tells me and if I’m not happy I tell her. So we’ve got a great relationship on that level. I can shout at her and she doesn’t take it that personally. Torsten Schmidt So if I was now starting out... I mean how did you survive without doing no productions, for example? Especially in something with the [inaudible] for exclusivity? Fabio Yeah, I mean nowadays you’ve got to be an artist to be a DJ. It’s quite sad. It’s very difficult now to just be a DJ on your own merit and just go out there. but to have lasted this long is a testament to me in a funny sort of way because I’ve done it without having anything to sell ever, apart from the fact that I’m a DJ. I’ve not done it off the back of having big tunes out there. I’ve done it from the fact I’m just a DJ and that’s very rare nowadays, to find a DJ that’s not an artist. So on one level I feel privileged that I’m still around and I still get booked on merit, more than the fact I’m Fabio who made this great tune but can’t DJ so well, which happens quite a lot nowadays. Torsten Schmidt Does it? Fabio Yeah it does. With artists, yeah. I’m not going to name no names, but a lot of artists do live off the name thing. Torsten Schmidt Ummmm...you did dabbke in label work as well. Fabio We’ve still got it. We’ve still got the label, Creative Source. It’s hard work. It’s hard work trying to balance running a club night, DJing, doing the label, but drum & bass is going through a very good phase now. We’ve got a lot of young, exciting artists. We’ve got a guy called Alex Perez, we’ve got another guy called Breakage, we’ve got a whole slew of guys all under the age of 25 making the most amazing music and these guys are the next generation, so drum & bass has another 15 or so years left in it. Whereas five years that wasn’t the case so much, it was still a lot of the old figureheads on top of the game. Now these young guys have come and they’ve shaken up the Calibres, the Photeks, the Dillinjas... they’ve all got a wake-up call, man and they’ve all got to get their shit together. And even Goldie, who I spoke to other day, said he’s more inspired now than he has been any time in the last ten years. Which is good to hear, man. That’ll be great for the game. And the fact that we’re getting these new guys from all over the world, we’ve got some great artists from Australia, New Zealand, America, Brazil, China, everywhere. And that’s great. And in that respect as well, the internet has been a great thing. That’s the way you’ve got that link up. So on a worldwide level, the young cats, they’re doing it, man and they’re shaking up the game. So that’s great, man. Torsten Schmidt It’s slightly different compared to the days when you just got like crazy advances and the first thing you could do was buy like that really big fuck off desk and a new car and all that kind of stuff. Fabio That’s the most difficult thing. Torsten Schmidt It’s far more reasonable I’d say than difficult, maybe. Fabio It’s very difficult because we kind of exist on vinyl sales as well. The whole download thing is very difficult to sella nd package, so we’re still doing vinyl as a main sales point and that’s kind of dying. Vinyl sales are not great at the moment, so the artists aren’t getting paid the same kind of money the was two or three years ago, so on that level it’s slightly worrying that vinyl sales are not doing so well. And that’s what a lot of the drum & bass fraternity have got this problem with using Serato Scratch, because if you guys use Serato Scratch with Cds then the kids aren’t going to want to buy vinyl. Torsten Schmidt I mean, on the one hand the writer is not going to buy a lot of vinyl anyway. A lot of it would have been sent to him as well, so if he plays... Fabio No, but then you buy dub plates. The dub plates that we buy cost £50, which is $80/90, which is a lot of money. You could spend mortgage money for a month on dub plates and then you can get the same kind of thing just burning a CD but you don’t get the same sound. I don’t think you get the same sound youdo off vinyl. Torsten Schmidt How many cutting house have closed down over the last ten years? Fabio Oh, many. There’s only two left in London now. So that whole thing’s dying, so the futur’s not looking great for vinyl. But hey, you never know - I’ve heard that there’s a vinyl revolution coming around so let’s pray that happens. I don’t know how true that is, but it’s odd that a lot of kids gorwing up nowadays have never used a deck, which is quite strange, man. I went the other day to buy a Sony Walkman for a relative of mine in Jamaica and I walked in the shop and said “Can I have a Sony Walkman?” and he showed me these DVDs and I said, “No, a cassette.” And he really didn’t know what I was talking about. He was like “Cassette?” and I was like “Yeah, yeah, cassettes.” And he kind of laughed at me and I just thought that’s happened so quickly and now they’re talking about CDs being obsolete very soon. It’s all going to be MP3s. It’s quite scary the way things move. Torsten Schmidt When you take the tape as an example, back when you were listening to Radio Luxembourg or whatever, if someone from London sent me a tape of Colin Dale, I would listen to this tape religiously, because that was the only source. Now, possibly within an hour, I could download 8 terrabytes of mix shows that when am I going to listen to them? How do you think is that changing the whole perception of music psychologically and all? Fabio That’s why I do worry slightly about what happens next, because, as you said, we’ve gone from tape, which you could send to somebody, and it’d take a couple of days to get there, you’d sit down and listen to it, where now you can burn stuff in a couple of seconds. There’s a freakishness about that I think... Torsten Schmidt Is worrying the right approach? That’s all I’m wondering. because on the other hand you can find out about studd so much more easily. Fabio And that’s the flipside. That’s the whole thing about technology. As much as i can turn around and hate on technology, there’s so much plusses about it as well. I’m getting all my stuff fro Instant Messenger now and for me to go back to guys sending me CDs is just not going to happen. Becuase I’m now just so immersed in turning on my computer, just saying I’ll get a tune as soon as it’s finished. I could be playing a tune finished in London tonight in my set which is just bizarre. I mean, seven years ago - even four years ago - if you’d have said to be that could happen I’d have been like “No fucking way.” I mean, Grooverider took me to his house and he said “I’m going to burn some stuff for you on AIM” and I was like “What are you talking about?” and he burned this stuff and he got it from someone and I was like “Shit...” And four years before that we was recording our shows at Radio One on cassette. That was just like 1998 we were doing that. Eight years down the road and you can do all this mad shit, man. You can preprogram your whole set and do all this mad shit. But I just hope it will never take away from the art of you doing it. You know, it’s all good and well. When I was younger there was all these stories about the ronots ding the cleaning and the washing up in your house - [to Torsten] can you remember that? - they used to have these stories about the robots taking over and these were the days when it weren’t about the War on Terror and we were all scared about nuclear bombs and the Cold War. And that’s probably where my fear of computers comes from - that whole thing about robots, like they’re going to take over humankind and they’ll turn on us and shit like that, do you know what I mean? But it’s not robots, it’s computers. It’s not this thing walking around in an apron cleaning your house, that’s never going to happen. But computers is what’s happened and as much as technology is where it’s at and it’s great and it’s fast and it’s now, you’ve got to keep a semblance of art in some way, you’ve got to keep a semblance of doing things for yourslef and thining a bit more about stuff. Torsten Schmidt You said earlier that a lot of what made you was the art of selection. How do you you think the role of thr gatekeeper or the quality control or the filter or whatever, however we’re going to call this institution because I don’t even want to call it a person, how do you think that’s going to evolve? Fabio I think that’s going to go. I think that’s going to go. I think that the way things are going I don’t think there’s going to be any gatekeepers. I don’t think that me talking about traditional values is going to change anything. I think things are going to be so fast and so quick that no-one’s going to care because it’s like this “I want it and I want it now” culture. People don’t really care about tradition so much and don’t get me wrong - I’m not hating on that, I’m not hating on that, because when I was younger I hated tradition, I hated everything that was like “You’ve got to keep this real and you’ve got to keep that real” and when you’re younger you’re like “Fuck keeping it real, I just want to do what I do.” You know what I’m saying? But I don’t want to sound too preachy at the same time. I don’t want to sit down... My daughter’s four and I want her to have all these things. I want her to be able to get tunes online and I’m not going to sit down and tell her “Listen to cassettes, it’s much warmer, you get a better sound.” I’m not going to do that, man. Torsten Schmidt But you’ve got this example right at home. Your daughter is four and you can maybe remember kids that were four when you were four... to what extent do you think her world is different to yours as far as needs and wants and dreams and imaginations and wishes and...? Fabio I hate the word “keeping it real” but I try and do certain things, not let her watch too much TV and not let her do certain things, but I don’t want to stifle her from the outside world because you’re going to meet the outside world anyway. She’s going to school now, which is very scary. She had her first day at school three weeks ago and I was terrified because you know how scary the first day at school is. But she knows how to use my mobile phone, she knows how to turn my computer on. She doesn’t know how to use it yet but she will within the next two years. And I can’t stop that because she’s going to need to do that. In two years’ time, God knows what’s going to be around and I don’t want to stop her from ever... I don’t want to be a traditionalist. My father used to say to me “Oh that shit you’re listneing to...” which at the time was funk. And I don’t want to say to my daughter “You’ve got to be doing this and you’ve got to be doing that.” I’m going to give her freedom, but I’m also going to tell her where I’m coming from and she can go either that road or that road. As long as she’s got it up there [points to temple] and she learns at school and knows that education’s very important, that’s the important thing. Torsten Schmidt So how do you feel now with music which was so concerned with being at the top of technology and upfront and all that being around for 20 odd years now? I mean, can it get more ironic? Fabio Yeah, yeah, I think it can because I think... Torsten Schmidt Being around for 40 years? Fabio I think it will be. As I said, the youth are very important and as long as they come around with fresh ideas and they come making some different stuff and some very interesting stuff, so as long as you’ve got that... And I think there are people really into real music now, who have seen through the mass-produced bullshit and the real shit that’s out there. You listen to that stuff nd it’s so sanitized and so horrible. I think now you’re getting more and more people, like you’re getting people who are fucked off with governments and politicians and what’s up there and people who are like “You’ve got to like this.” People are like, “No, I don’t have to like this, I like what I like.” As I said before, I really do feel there is a real movement at the moment and a real going forwards in all music genres. Torsten Schmidt Just to clarify, “real music” not meaning you have to have all traditional instruments, because I guess some of the most horrible drum & bass was the kind of drum & bass that was “Hey we need a real jazz player on this.” Fabio Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, when I say “real music” I mean music that’s not marketed and that’s not forced upon you and you’re not made to like it. And that’s the way I see the whole conglomerate thing now. I think you’re foced to like Nelly Furtado because that’s all you fucking see on MTV. That’s all you see on billboards and in record shops. Now, just underneath all that, there’s so much good shit going on. It’s not out there in the mainstream but people are picking up on it. There’s names you can mention to people and they’re like “Yeah man, I love that cat.” There’s so much interesting stuff going on electonically, like Sonar Music Festival. That’s a great festival. There’s a lot of good stuff going on in Italy as well, a lot of good electornic festivals out there, so I think they’re really, really important. Torsten Schmidt Now that you mention it, isn’t it comforting and healthy in a certain sense to see that, you said earlier you liked Timbaland, and Nelly Furtado gets him to an album for her and it’s still crap. Fabio Yeah, but... Timabaland, what I love... Torsten Schmidt And you know he will still do a good record after that. Fabio Yeah, but I think in the States you’ve got to do that. It’s like Clint Eastwood. He used to make films like Unforgiven and in between he’s making shit films like Pink Cadillac. And they said to him, “Why do you do that?” and he said “Because I’m playing the game. I’ve got to do that to do what i really want to do.” Scorsese’s the same. He made The Color Of Money which was a terrible film, and he made Goodfellas jusrt before that I think. Sometimes you have to compromise to get what you want. Sometimes you’ve got to play the game. Timbaland’s doing that because he wants to make money. He knows, at the end of the day, he can produce underground shit on mixtapes. Maybe he’s not keeping it real but that’s the way it is, man. He’s probably got his big Bentley he’s got to look after and that’s why he’s doing shit like that. Torsten Schmidt That thing needs a lot of petrol. Fabio Yeah, needs a lot of petrol and stuff like that. Sending his kids to private school and stuff. He needs the money. But I still think you can listen to all that shit and you can still hear his beats are still incredible. You know, that “Promisicuous Girl” by Nelly Furtado, which is just a nothing tune, but you listen to the way he arranges his beats in that tune, man. That’s him, man. That’s his blueprint and he’s totally doing his thing, so I don’t think he totally sold it out. Even Dr Dre. I’m a big fan. I’m a big fan of a lot of them cats, man. Maybe because of their history a lot of the time, but you’ve got to give your thanks. And reggae music, which is the most underrated music I think there’s ever been. I think reggae music was the first to along with rhythm tracks and it was the blueprint for dance music, you know, dubs. The whole thing comes from reggae, man. I’m a great lover of reggae music, a great lover of King Tubby, Augustus Pablo, Lee Perry. To me, that’s the godfather of music, and reggae music’s the godfather of dance music. And I’ve got to pay homage to James Brown because that guy... Man, rare groove comes from James Brown and searching for rare James Brown albums and the guy’s still out there doing it. I’m going back and listening to a lot of stuff from that era at the moment. Torsten Schmidt So here’s to youth and here’s to listening, I guess. Fabio For sure. The thing that’s kept me here more than anything else is passion. I’ve still got a real passion for this and I still wake up every day totally thankful that I’m in a position to go places, to do things, to see things, to meet different kinds people. My dad’s still like “Where are you?” and I’m like “I’m in Melbourne” and he’s like “Shit man! You’re in Melbourne!” and he’s checkign up on me because it’s a million miles away from where I’m coming from, from where I was brought up. The way I was brought up, it’s still a dream for me to be doing all this shit, man. Torsten Schmidt Does he understand what you do? Fabio No, no. He hasn’t got a clue. He just knows that I travel a lot and I’m out there playing music. My mother, who passed away last year, she was probably my biggest influence because she was... Where my dad used to be “Ah, yeah, go to school and read you book, what are you doing with this music thing?” my mom was always like “Don’t listen to him - just do what you want to do.” She always appreciated what I did and she used to listen to my radio shows two to four in the morning... Torsten Schmidt Would she badmouth you for cursing on air? Fabio No, no, no. Being from a Jamaican family, I never swore in front of her. I could never do that. I used to go to my wife and she used to go “Fuck off, mum!” and I was like “What are you doing?” You can’t do that in Jamaica families at all. Any time she was listening I used to be careful with what I said. But she was a major force in my life. Torsten Schmidt Would you love for your dad to understand what you do? Fabio I would, actually. I don’t think he would get it so much, but he’s just very proud. He doesn’t care - as long as I’m doing what I’m doing and still out there doing it, he’s very proud. I don’t think he really cares what it is. He’s like “Are you still alright? Are you still DJing a lot?” and it’s like “Yes, dad.” So he’s happy, as long as I’m still doing OK. Questions anyone? Audience member Any tunes? Fabio Any tunes?. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I’ve got some tunes here, do you want to hear some tunes? Cool. TORSTEN SCHMIDT While you’re looking for the tunes there’s a question there from our man. Audience member Hey man, how you doing? You mentioned LTJ Bukem before, who’s a massive influence of mine, and I wanted to ask if you’ve done much stuff with the 4Hero guys like Mark Mac and Dego and the part they played in it back in the day? Fabio For sure. I mean, sometimes with stuff like this you forget names, but 4Hero, maybe more than anyone else, “Mr. Kirk’s Nightmare”, the worst thing about that I remember playing that in a cub when someone passed out, ecstas, and kind of died in front of me when I played that tune. Which, if you don’t know it, it says, “Mr. Kirk, your son is dead.” And I played that and someone was like, “Listen, take that record off, someone’s passed out, man.” But that was a subversive tune. That tune came out and freaked the shit out of everybody. It was this chaotic rhythm with this “Mr. Kirk your son is dead,” and everyone used to go crazy to it and I used to be a bit like, “This is weird. Dancing to a tune about a dead person.” 4Hero were very important in Goldie’s career as well. Goldie’s greatest moments came with Marc and them guys, Internal Affairs and stuff like that with them engineering his stuff. TORSTEN SCHMIDT There’s a bit of a love story of those guys hooking up at your night, right? Fabio Yeah, at Speed. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Wasn’t it at Rage? Fabio Yeah, Goldie met Björk at Speed, he met Marc and them guys at Rage, Marc and Dego. Audience member Before you were talking about everyone getting together and the whole West End thing, was there a real community flavour amongst producers as well? Like 4Hero and Goldie and stuff, did everyone kind of share stuff? Fabio I’ll tell you where everyone shared stuff, there used to be a cutting plant called Music House and that used to be the aim of the day, everyone used to go down there and cut dubs. Everybody. When I say everybody, everyone. Bukem, 4Hero, Goldie, Ed Rush, Dillinja, Photek, everyone used to meet up at this grimy little place in Holloway Road in North London and we used to cut dubs there, just a little shack. And the guy used to have a lathe and he used to cut reggae stuff like Trojan and Greensleeves from back in the day and we all used to go there and meet up and a lot of the exchange of ideas came from Music House so there was that sense of family. Not family, it’s kind of like, “Oh, he’s made this bad tune, I’ve gotta make a better tune.” That’s kind of what’s happening now but it was more so back in the day because you used to go in and, say, Bukem, he brought in “Music”. I remember the day he came in with that tune he was like, “Fab…” And we were all in there and he put it on and for me it was the most important tune since I heard “It Is What It Is”, Rhythim Is Rhythim. Because what that tune, It Is What It Is, done with techno, it made me see that techno could sound so beautiful, “Music” did that. To me there wasn’t a beautiful drum & bass record until that moment. “Music” came along and I was just like, “Whoa, this music’s got a future in it, got timeless qualities, got everything you need.” So Bukem, he was amazingly important to what I do. What people don’t understand, when Bukem first started DJing, he had this reputation for people falling asleep when he was DJing. Seriously, people used to sit down on the floor and everyone used to be like, “Oh no, I can’t get into this shit,” but he didn’t used to care. He never cared. He never, ever sold out. He’d never put on a tune for them. And I used to say, “Danny, sometimes you’ve got to compromise,” and he was like, “Listen, I’m not going to play no music that I don’t like. I’m just not going to do it and if they don’t like it, they don’t like it.” And I loved that about Danny and he’s still like that now, he doesn’t give a shit, he just plays what he plays. That is a very difficult thing to do, especially in the Drum & bass scene when you get slagged off for doing certain things and you’ve got to have four, five rewinds and stuff like that. So respect to Bukem. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you talk about Music House as a social gathering point and peer pressure going on, it’s not only about the tracks and the musical developments, it’s also a really interesting social point because you’ve got this closed net of people and someone’s got this advance from this record company, someone’s got a new car, someone’s got this really ugly looking Nike trainers, but he still buys them because they’re 200 quid. As someone who has survived so many of these things and seen them come and go, what are the things you learn to stay above all that and cut away the crap? Fabio Just not to listen to it. Just not to listen to what anyone says, really, because you go along with what people say and you end up getting totally wrong-footed. It’s a bit like being at school sometimes. A lot of childishness going on, there’s a lot of hating. Through that closeness you get that, there’s a real competitiveness in Drum & bass, which is really good on one level, but on another level it’s a bit tiresome. Anyway, listen, I’m going to play a tune. Can I play “Music”? This is a tune that I, as I said to you, I heard this when Drum & bass was going through a really kind of glum phase and I needed something and Bukem was like, “Listen Fab, I’ve done this tune, I really don’t know if you’re going to like it,” and he played it to me and it just blew my mind. (music: LTJ Bukem – “Music”/ applause) FABIO That’s a bad tune. [applause]. Bad tune. The next tune I’m going to play is from an album that had so much ambition, and so much epic quality, which was an album that I heard in the ‘70s. I remember my cousin bringing it ‘round, which was Stevie Wonder - Songs In The Key Of Life. The reason why this album was so magical for me, it came at a time when I think in the ‘70s people took more risks and were willing to do more things on an epic scale. Like Apocalypse Now, a film like that could never be made now, people just wouldn’t really spend that kind of money and have the ambition to do something on such a large scale. And this album, if you listen to Stevie Wonder’s use of electronic music as well, in “Village Ghetto Land” and “Pastime Paradise”, which Coolio used and stuff like that, you can hear how forward he was with the whole electronic sound. The track that I’ve chosen is I Wish because it reminds me of me growing up in Brixton and the way things were and the things that your parents used to say to you. And it’s a quite corny song, the way it’s produced, but it’s got so much soul and so much feeling and as soon as you hear it, you just get that feeling of joy. Stevie Wonder also had this magical quality of making music that you think you’ve heard somewhere before. The Beatles had that as well, they make music that when you hear it you think you’ve heard it a million times before yet it is so unique at the same time. So this is Stevie Wonder “I Wish”. (music: Stevie Wonder - “I Wish”) That’s Stevie Wonder “I Wish.” This next song I’m going to play for you, I’m going to play you something brand new, it’s a drum & bass/techno hybrid. It’s a bit Detroit-y but still running at 175 and it’s still got that real drum & bass feel. It’s by a guy called Spirit who’s in New York and it’s called “Coming Home” and this is what I’m talking about, about this new techno hybrid that’s coming into drum & bass. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Don’t you think with your show on the BBC they would enjoy you doing something similar to this as well? Fabio Well, they’re getting a new slot where a lot of DJs are playing stuff they wouldn’t normally play and I’m looking forward to that. Hopefully, I’ll get called in because I do really feel that I should be given an outlet. We’ve asked in the past if we could do stuff like this, but there’s a lot of red tape to go through and stuff like that. But they’ve started a new show where you do what you want to do and play stuff from your musical background so hopefully that’ll get going and I could do that because I’d love to do that. TORSTEN SCHMIDT As you can see upstairs there’s a little outlet like that as well and there’s not a lot of red tape there, I guess about none, and we’d really welcome you to maybe later on, with an open door, do something similar up there in the radio slot. Since we’ve been sitting here for two hours and people are kind of getting ready for lunch, I don’t want them to fade away without giving you the applause and the props that you deserve for sharing your insight with us for the last two hours here. So, give the man a hand [applause]. But nevertheless, you’re going to be around and we still have to hear that tune. Fabio I am actually really jetlagged and at this time of the day I’m starting to get a bit fucked up. I’ve got this real allergy to caffeine and I drank a Red Bull earlier and now I’m really starting to talk too fast. Right, I’m going to put on this last tune but thanks a lot guys and I walked around seeing what’s going on here and respect to what you guys are doing. Music, it sounds like a cliché, but it’s the best game you can be in and as long as you’ve got the passion and the belief and you really want to do it and you’ve got the right feel for it and you get what fits for you. Those are the most important things. It doesn’t matter what genre it is, the most important thing is never let anyone tell you what to do because it’s all about doing what you believe in and people can sidetrack you and the more people tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing that means you’re doing the right thing. That’s happened to me so many times, people saying, “You shouldn’t do this, you shouldn’t do that,” and the more they do it, the more you know you’re on the right track. So as long as you keep doing that that’s the most important thing.

FaltyDL
Hailing from New Haven, Connecticut, Andrew Lustman, AKA FaltyDL, fell in love with British dance music and never looked back. Caught in a crossfire of influences, from dub, techno and house to hip-hop and future soul, FaltyDL’s abilities have been acknowledged by a range of acclaimed electronic labels since his debut in 2009, including Planet Mu, Ramp, Rush Hour, 50Weapons, Swamp 81 and Hemlock. In 2013 he released his Hardcourage album on the iconic Ninja Tune imprint, marking another high point in the career of this prolific producer.
In this talk at the 2013 Red Bull Music Academy, Lustman discussed his influences, philosophy on making and releasing music and the lessons learned as an independent producer in a new age.
Hosted by Benji B Please join me in welcoming Mr. FaltyDL! (Applause) FaltyDL Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Benji B So should we call you Drew or Falty today? FaltyDL Drew. Benji B Alright, Drew. FaltyDL Or either. Benji B Well, thanks very much for being with us and coming to talk. FaltyDL It’s my pleasure. Benji B For anyone in the room that’s not familiar with your work, how would you
describe what you do for a living? FaltyDL I am an electronic music producer. I sort of DJ in my own way, but I mostly
produce records. I’m signed to a couple different labels, primarily Ninja Tune
in London. And I wake up and I try and make a tune or finish a remix, or do
something so I don’t feel completely lazy. And, like, I’m not working for my
bread. But, yeah, I basically just answer a lot of emails and make music. Sort
of what I do. Benji B And how would you describe the kind of music that you make? FaltyDL I guess “dance music” that’s sort of hard to dance to, but sometimes not so
hard. I’m looking down at a lot of my catalogue down on the ground there. I
don’t know how to describe it all ‘cause I’ve touched on a lot of
different genres and different things over the years. But [I’m] influenced by
a lot of UK dance music and old Chicago and Detroit records as well. Benji B Well, maybe a good way to kick things off is just to play something from right
now. FaltyDL Yeah. Benji B What you’re working on right now? Something recent. Just to give us an idea. FaltyDL Yeah, absolutely. I’ll play something from my new record that’s out now. This is a track on my album that just came out a couple
months ago. So this is the new, new, new-ish…. (music: Falty DL – “Finally Some Shit/The
Rain”) It’s just a loop. It just keeps doing that. You get the idea. Benji B So that’s from your new LP, Hardcourage, which is out on Ninja Tune. FaltyDL Yeah. Benji B When you’re putting an album together that’s sort of influenced by the
club, but you also want to make a record that people can listen to, how do you
find that magic sweet spot in between the two? FaltyDL Well, I think it’s sort of... in my catalog it’s rare that I make a track
that’s either a DJ tool or a real dancefloor track. For me,
it’s finding a bunch of tracks that have some sort of theme together. As far
as whether or not they all belong in the home, or on the iPod and whatever, and
listening to it not in a club, in a club atmosphere, I think they all can sort
of work like that. So it’s really between me and the A&R of whatever label
I’m working with on that record. Benji B And how do you know when something’s finished? FaltyDL Is anything ever really finished? Yeah, it’s finished like the day I’m
done making it. I mean, I work on a track and when I get really bored, it’s
finished. You know? (Laughter) I’m not really a perfectionist. I think
some of my favorite moments in my own tracks, if I can say that, is when I’ve
just had some sort of happy accident, like, literally in the program, that
makes something sound a certain way and I’m like, “Alright that’s cool, that’s
good enough. Next.” You know, for me, it’s just about making music, it’s not
so much about like making these perfect tracks. I don’t know. Benji B And what about the agony of putting together an album, and picking ten
songs out of 30, or whatever your process might have been? FaltyDL Yeah, well, on this one there was a lot of back and forth with the
label and in the end I think we came to a really good compromise. I
mean, the idea of compromising in any type of art is something you hopefully
don’t have to ever encounter. But that being said, I mean, there’s realistic
things, like the amount of time you can put on a record and budget and
campaign and all that type of stuff. But this one, yeah, it was cool. I mean,
I just really respect the ears I was working with at Ninja, so it was great.
And in the past on my albums with Mike Paradinas at Planet
Mu, this was someone who I had been sending tracks to for years, who just knows
my music – like yourself – for a long time, and just knows it really well and
knows what my best stuff sounds like. And when I feel like I’m talking
to someone that I can really trust, I want to hear more what they
think. ‘Cause I mean, if I released the tracks that I
really wanted to release, I think, it might not have been a broad look
at the time I spent making that album. I don’t know. Benji B And when you say you look for approval, or you care about people’s
opinions, who is that? Is that your peers, is that other musicians? Is it
journalists? FaltyDL Did I say that? Benji B You kind of did, yeah. FaltyDL In what? Like, as like a final project, the album? Benji B Yeah. FaltyDL No, I think, I mean... Benji B Do you care what people think? FaltyDL Yeah! Of course, I absolutely do. I mean, this is the way I relate to the
world, is through my art. I absolutely care what people think about it. But I
mean, I’m still gonna put it out there, no matter what, and I’m getting a
thicker skin towards reviews and all that type of stuff. So I absolutely care
what people think. And I think my favorite people to send music to are people
that I just really respect, people whose catalogs I know really well. And I
send them music and I want them to be brutally honest with me, what they
think. Benji B Who are those people for you? FaltyDL Let’s see, who are the people I’m currently sending music to? One contemporary of mine is Floating Points. I really like his music a lot and I think you
could probably hear that in some of my records. And what’s funny is I sent him
a text after this album came out and a couple reviews were comparing us two. I
was like, “Man, I’m so sorry. Like, they keep saying I’m trying to sound like
you.” He’s like, “Man, I listen to your records, so I don’t know who first
listened to whose, but you know... we both listen to each other’s records.” So
that was pretty cool. I’m gonna release a record this year under my own name
on 2000Black, which is
Dego’s label from
4Hero. That’s is a guy I
really respect, of course. Benji B And before you did your albums, you put out a series of 12"s that
made everyone sit up and take notice. Maybe we should go back to the first 12"
that really had an impact for you. I think it was your first 12" ever, wasn’t
it? FaltyDL It was my first 12". And I think you played it on the radio quite early on. “To
London,” let’s see here. How about we open this up? Benji B Thanks for bringing all the vinyl in. FaltyDL Yeah, well I mean I never get a chance to play them so, why not? (Laughter) (music: FaltyDL – “To London”) Benji B When was that from? FaltyDL Released, I think, the beginning of 2009? Made it like 2007, 2008. Benji B Right so, relatively recently. FaltyDL Yeah. Benji B Depending on how old you are. FaltyDL In the great scheme of things. Benji B But the clue is in the name, right? I mean, there’s obviously a lot of
influence going on in there. And one side of the record is “To New York” and
the other side is “To London,” right? FaltyDL No. Benji B No, one is “To Party,” one is “To London”? FaltyDL Neither... (laughs) Benji B No? OK. FaltyDL This is “To London.” “To New York” came out on the record on Planet Mu
that same year. Benji B That’s right. FaltyDL And “To Party” was the next 12" I did for Ramp. Benji B But both cities seem to have had a big influence. Obviously you live here [New York]. FaltyDL Yeah. Benji B But it seems both New York and London have had a strong influence on your
music. FaltyDL Yeah, totally. I mean, this was me really just trying to make a dance record,
I guess. Like a house record. But it’s funny, I hadn’t really been to many
parties where I’d heard this music – I guess, at
the time we called it post-dubstep, didn’t we? Or some people did – where I’d
heard that on a system. So my interpretation of that is this record, which
I actually mixed down very quietly. And there’s some weird things I do where I
just sort of drop a 16th note here and there from a measure and so it’s
like an instant clang playing this record out. You know, unless you cue it like halfway through. That’s why I think I like listening to it now, is
because I hear a lot of my old mistakes but there’s something sort of honest
in those mistakes that I was making, I think, because I was just so excited
about making a record at the time. And my friend did the artwork, and we’re
like, “Yeah, we’ll put 45rpm ‘cause it’s cool when records say the speed on
the outside.” These little things, and you can’t even really read some of the
typography, it’s a bit rasterized. But we were just so happy to make a record,
it’s so cool. Benji B So, talking about your musical influences, a lot of which come from outside of
the United States. You’re talking about London and this record definitely has a bit of the garage shuffle and I know that you’re a big fan of
all music from London and the UK, including jungle and stuff like that, right? FaltyDL Yup, very much. Benji B So when did all of that wave of music really start influencing you? FaltyDL Well, I got into electronic music, like old Warp Records stuff, when I was
pretty young, when I was about 15 or 16, young enough. A little over half my
life ago. Benji B And what kind of parties were you going to and where were you living? FaltyDL Well, that’s the thing, I was living in New Haven, I hadn’t moved to New York
yet, and I was going to hardcore shows – meaning like punk rock shows and hip-hop
shows. That’s what I was going to. But I was going home and I was listening to
Aphex Twin and Squarepusher and stuff like that. And it wasn’t until later, when I moved to New York in 2005,
that I started really going to parties. But it was that sound from London that
was coming over, it was Dub War [in New York], and it was Mala and
Kode9 and Loefah and Benji B Two of whom we’re going to see tonight. FaltyDL Yup, that’s right. Benji B Well, you’ve brought a whole stack of vinyl in and it seems a shame not for
you to illustrate some of your musical palate. Yeah, and also, it’s Friday –
it’s that point in the Academy where we’re all sitting around, and you know,
and we’ve all gone out every single night. So, let’s just listen to some good
music, if that’s alright with you lot? FaltyDL Yeah. Benji B Is that cool? That’s what we’re all here to do anyway, right? So you know,
Drew’s brought all these records in, some of which I can already see are
definitely the kind that will wake you up. FaltyDL OK, we wanna wake up then. I’ll play a wake up record. Benji B So what’s this? FaltyDL We’re gonna play Nasty Habits – Doc Scott, [an] old 31 Records [release]. Yeah. Let’s see if I
can cue this up. Benji B So, just before you play this, maybe give us a bit of context to why
you’re playing this record, what it means to you and when you heard it. FaltyDL Sure, sure. Well, when did this come out? This came out ‘96? Benji B No, a bit later I think, like ‘98 or so. FaltyDL ‘98? OK. So, of course, I was not raving in a field listening to this when it
came out. I was here listening to hip-hop and, I don’t know, Bob Dylan or
whatever I was listening to at the time. But I guess my context is just around
2004, 2005, when my friend from England, who was a bit older and who had DJed for
years, was describing to me the euphoria he felt standing in a field
listening to jungle and drum & bass. Like, in the middle of the
night with the wind going through the trees and stuff. And it has a lot to do
with the bassline on this track and the way it builds. But when I started hearing… first, I guess, [I heard] what came out of jungle, I did it in
reverse. I heard, like, Squarepusher records, which is like sped up drum &
bass, which is influenced by jungle records but it’s later. So,
like many musical avenues I’ve discovered, I’ve sort of started
current and gone backwards to find where things come from. And I think I’ve
done that in my own productions as well. As I go back and I make some deep
house now, and things that have been around longer than more current flavors. But when I heard this, I think I felt the same euphoria he was describing and
it’s an excitement I get from listening to a lot of electronic music that I
didn’t get from listening to rock or from hip-hop growing up. So it’s always
been this, like, “Was I born in the wrong place?” But, I mean, it’s all good.
I’ve gotten here somehow for some reason. (music: Nasty Habits – “Shadow Boxing”) Benji B You can clap for Doc Scott, wherever Scott is. FaltyDL It’s funny watching you with your eyes closed. Benji B Sorry. FaltyDL No, I think that’s it. We have two different experiences. It’s new to me. I’m
like, “This so exciting, this is new to me.” So I think you’re like going back
to that field. Benji B This is not my interview, it’s yours, but the first time I ever heard that
record, it got pulled up 12 times. And the bass doesn’t come in ‘till about four
minutes in so that was a good 40 minutes. (Laughs) But what do you want to play
next and why? FaltyDL Yeah, OK. Benji B This is like Show and Tell with Drew. FaltyDL (Laughs) Yeah, I’m showing off my record collection . We’re going to go back a
few more years to ‘95 or something. Dillinja, “[The] Angels Fell.” This came out on
Metalheadz. Yeah, let’s play some of that. My hand shakes when I put it on. (music: Dillinja – “The Angels
Fell”) Benji B So that’s Dillinja, “[The] Angels Fell.“ I mean, you have to clap to that record
whether it’s his or not. So it’s my absolute pleasure to
sit here – and all of ours as well – to listen to these amazing records, but
how do we relate some these records back to you and how the feeling in these
records has that affected your approach to producing music? FaltyDL I mean, it has. I don’t know if I thought about how this has directed my approach but I think the attitude like that goes along with this
record – not only just the music, but like, the label, the producer itself, the
whole package of this thing – mastered at The
Exchange. Everything about this. There’s
even some other stuff written there that feeds into my excitement to putting a
record together. Then I think I’ve felt that excitement on smaller records
when I feel it’s a hands-on approach, like releasing records on Swamp 81 with
Loefah. Benji B I mean, a lot of us, including Loefah, are obviously a generation influenced
by Metalheadz, not only the label but the club. The whole movement. What was
the equivalent for you? Was there a nightclub or a label or a movement that
you were really influenced by and went to in the States? FaltyDL No, I absolutely was not. Yeah. Benji B So how does that change your ability to have access to the music and
experience it in a nightclub? FaltyDL The first time I heard a lot of these records in a club was me playing them in
London in my sets, which is maybe a throwback for people that were there or
playing it to young kids that had never heard them as well. I mean, that’s
the funny thing. The context outside my bedroom – there really isn’t one. I
think I just latched on to something years ago from an Aphex Twin record and
then just followed English labels. You know? I don’t know. Benji B You were talking to me earlier about also being influenced by something you
call IDM, which is also interesting to me and maybe to people from outside the
United States who don’t really know what that term means. FaltyDL Yeah, it’s a dirty word. Which I only use just because I’ve heard and
read it so many times. Benji B What defines IDM? What is IDM? FaltyDL Well, what it means, you want me to say it? You don’t want to say it. (Laughter) It’s a really weird term. It’s means “intelligent dance music” which is just
sort of degrading to any other dance music out there. And what I’ve found in
my own production – in talking to other artists, this is not my own idea – but
I find that getting a dancefloor moving and dancing is really intelligent and
hard to do in your own productions. Benji B What kind of artists and producers would fall under that journalistic
category? FaltyDL Well, you know, the ones that I brought in my collection, there’s Aphex
Twin and some Squarepusher and some old Luke
Vibert stuff, and a lot of the old catalog on Planet Mu. Although, you know,
they then adopted their own terms like drill & bass and braindance, which was
Aphex Twin’s thing with Rephlex. So I think when any artist feels like a
journalist is putting them in a box they’re going to try to squeeze out of
there naturally. Benji B And you are pretty candid in saying about how certain records have influenced
specific songs of yours, like… FaltyDL Yeah. “Aftermath” and “Hardcourage.” That’s an old Warp record there. Benji B Yeah. Maybe give us a example of that and how you find the line between wearing your influence on your sleeve, and also having something... FaltyDL My sleeve here. On my left arm. Benji B Yeah. FaltyDL Yeah, “Aftermath.” This is Warp’s sixth single, 1990. Well, I don’t know, WAP #6, maybe they that another cat[alog] number as well. I’m playing the influence first and then my record. Benji B Cool. (music: Nightmares On Wax – “Aftermath #1”) FaltyDL Yeah, so that’s that. Benji B So this is a direct influence on one of your most recent tunes. FaltyDL Yeah, this one came out probably a year ago. “Hardcourage,” which is the same
name as my album. I don’t know how that happened. (music: FaltyDL – “Hardcourage”) That’s the most bass I’ve ever put in a record, by far, definitely. Benji B So I wanted to ask you, I mean, we’ve been lucky enough this week to
hear from some amazing legends, Giorgio Moroder and
Van Dyke Parks, and
people who have an incredible history of music. But as someone who’s an
independent producer right now, who a lot of people can relate to in
the room – we’ve got a lot of people here who are making tracks, probably some
are signed, probably some are looking to get signed. Can you eat from putting
records out anymore? FaltyDL Yeah. Benji B Can you survive? I mean, obviously it’s a truism to say at the moment
that the touring is where the money is, that’s what everyone says. But some of
the early 12"s that you played, you could make money from putting those out.
Is that still the case? Can you still survive in New York from putting
independent albums out? FaltyDL Yeah. Albums, yes. Singles, much harder. Albums are more expensive and the
return is a little bit greater, but I think it ties back to the fact that I
don’t have a lot of experience going out and raving as a kid. And I have come
from a family that believes in a real nine-to-five structured job. And also
what I said before about if I’m not making music, I feel like I’m being
really lazy. So I feel like I have the drive in me just to keep making
tunes and releasing records. OK, I’m answering in five different ways
at once. Touring can be a way to make a living. I mean, I’m
incredibly honored everytime I get flown out to play anywhere, or play even if
it’s just for a friend down the street, if it’s just for a pal and I’m playing
for free, or if I’m playing at some festival in Europe somewhere and they’re
really taking care of me. There’s always that whole range and I’m incredibly
honored. And that’s not just a diplomatic answer, like, I really do feel like,
“Why me? That’s crazy that I get to go that.” But there’s a lot of
aspects of touring which I don’t like. I don’t like traveling that much. I
hate airplanes. I mean, I’m a little bit afraid of flying. I don’t like any
of that. I prefer to be home, just in the studio. So I have this feeling
that I need to make albums and release big records and stuff. So you need a
lawyer, an accountant, and a good album deal (laughs). But yeah, it’s
totally possible. Benji B And how’d you get the good album deal? FaltyDL Uh… Benji B How? FaltyDL Releasing records. And being sort of my own manager. I mean, just hustling, in
a way, you know? Somehow presenting myself as a marketable thing, you know? Benji B Well, I guess we were talking before about how it’s a privilege to be able to
create, and how what most of us are trying to do in our lives is buy us the time to
be able to create, so that you don’t have to go and do the nine-to-five, so that you
can actually focus on going into the studio. And you were saying to me that
you’ve actually managed to do that, which is quite an achievement [through] music
alone. FaltyDL Yeah, I have. And my parents respect that, which is cool. No, I mean, that’s a
relatively new thing. I mean, I was hitting the road a lot harder last year.
Well, I don’t know. When the album first came out I did a good two-and-a-half
weeks of touring in Europe and then two-and-a-half weeks of touring in the
States. There was a good two months or so, just about, where I wasn’t
home. Benji B And you played the game and all that nonsense? All that online business?
Profiles and all the rest of it? Because it seems that a lot
of people think it’s more important to have your press campaign sorted
out before you make a record. What’s the process been for you? How important
is that whole brave new world of self-promotion online? What would be your dos
and don’ts for someone that’s just about to put their first artist
statement out there? FaltyDL Yeah, I mean, I would tell you this, if the label suggests… or even if you’re
part of the conversation of how much money is put towards an album campaign,
or a record campaign, I would be wary of large expenditures, which then
go into your account which you have to recoup. It’s not like owing the label
money, but it does go against you, and then you have to sell
enough records to get out of that. Because I think, honestly, what’s really hyped and what sells a lot is a new thing – a new label, with a Tumblr and a Twitter. And some sort of hype and maybe some big
DJ dropped a new tune in a Rinse set or something like
that, and there's a YouTube rip that gets like a couple thousand plays. I don’t know
what’s really more important than that, as far as getting the word out there. A
lot of the magazines are no longer magazines that do press, they are sort of
just webzines or whatever, websites. We are all adapting, you know?
So the fact that I could get an album deal did sort of blow my mind. Also,
publishing, you know? If you get on a song or video game or a commercial or
something like that. Benji B How early should you sign your publishing? FaltyDL Wait, or talk to people that have already signed it and see what they think
about it. I was thrown... Benji B That’s why I’m asking you. FaltyDL Yeah. The third option, take the third option, whatever it is. No, talk to
some friends and see what they’ve done, or some people and see what they have
done. I am glad that I didn’t sign the first option, and the second option, which
I did sign, was great. That expired and my third option is even better. I
don’t know. I mean it’s not what it used to be. I have a friend whose
publishing deal in ’98 bought him a house in London. Benji B Yeah, different times. FaltyDL That’s different times, that’s beaucoup bucks right there. (Laughs) Benji B Do you have a studio at home or a studio in New York that you
work out of? Talk to us on a technical level. FaltyDL Yeah, for sure. I have always had my studio in my apartment and I’m two months
away from having my studio not in my apartment and it’s kinda freaking me out,
because I’m used to just waking up and being right there. But the idea is that
I will be even more productive, and actually eat breakfast and get out of the
house. But I have always had a very in-the-box setup, which is an old
obsolete version of Reason – version 3.0 from like 2003, or something like that,
or maybe 2002. I have never wanted to even try to update it because I have gotten
so used to how it works. I think I am afraid of any sort of change with that.
Actually it’s no longer in my bedroom. There is a separate room
in my apartment. I have a true one-bedroom in New York, which has a second
room. Maybe it’s a two-bedroom. I don’t know. Benji B So you are never going to update Reason? FaltyDL I don’t know. I mean, it’s funny because they asked me to give a talk
once on version 6 and I said, “Yeah sure, why not?” Because I’m like, yeah,
why not, I’m a nice guy. I installed it on a laptop the night before with a
friend and had a crash course, and I showed up, and other than meeting my current
girlfriend at that talk it was a complete disaster. So it’s pretty good when
you look at it. But I had no idea what I was doing with it. Benji B Talking of which, marrying personal life and work life, you have made no
secret of the fact – in fact it’s almost part of the press release – that
your latest album was sort of an overture to winning the affection of a woman? FaltyDL You have got the word “muse” written down in a square and underlined, and in
exclamation point. Benji B “Everyone needs a muse.” Quote [from] FaltyDL. FaltyDL I did say that on the radio, didn’t I? Benji B You did. FaltyDL She liked that, so it worked. Benji B Hell of a drug. (Laughter) FaltyDL It’s funny though, the job of the muse is to probably show you the whole range of
emotions, right? But I can only create when I’m actually in a good mood. Even
when I’m making dark music it’s only because I’m happy. If there is a situation going on
where I’m not completely on the level then I can’t even make a tune. But maybe
that’s all part of a process, the creative process. Benji B So it worked. FaltyDL Yeah. I mean, I got an album done, so that was good. And I got two more to do,
so we’ll do it. Benji B Well, maybe you should play “For Karme.” FaltyDL “For Karme.” Benji B And then we will go questions right after. FaltyDL Okie dokie. (music: FaltyDL – “For Karme”) Thank you, thank you. Benji B So I just wanted to ask you about your label. I forgot
to talk to you about the next stage. I was going to ask you about the future,
but you just started a record label, right? FaltyDL Yeah, I did. Blueberry Records,
it’s official. I have barcodes and everything, and stickers. I made merch
before I released a record. Benji B And are you doing that all off your own back, or have you got help? FaltyDL No, all on my own. I’m looking at some different P&D [press and distribution] deals from different
distributors and stuff, and a lot of them want you to go in at least half on
the first release, which shouldn’t be too bad if you’re pressing up like 500
records or something. Benji B And seeing as you’re the artist and you can view it from the artist’s side of
the fence, what’s the first thing you’re gonna make sure you do? FaltyDL Pay my artists. (Laughs) Is that right? Is that the right answer? Benji B I mean, what other things as an artist, apart from receiving some of the
money you are owed, what things make a label good to work with? FaltyDL I think what I’m really excited about is… OK, I’ve found two artists whose
music I really want to release, and one of them I want to release everything he
sends me. He’s this young, super-excited guy and I have this excitement
when I hear his music that I want to have every time I’m about to release a
record, you know? So if I still have this label in ten years, hopefully I will
still have that excitement. I don’t know what I will have been through in the
next ten years, but... And what I really want to do is I want whoever the
artist is I’m releasing to have a real say in all of the creative aspects, with the artwork and the presentation. This artist also happens
to be a sculpture MFA student. I think he may have graduated already, and if
he wants to build a crazy website and some sculptures, let’s do it. You know
what I mean? Just do something interesting. I think if I can really trust
the artist, why get in the way and tell them how I think we should
present something? If this is a really talented person, I think they should
get it out there the way they want it to be seen. You know? And that’s me
obviously speaking from shit with releasing records with other people telling
me how to do it in certain ways and fighting to get it the way I want it, you
know? Benji B And I mean, how important is the whole visual aesthetic part to music these
days? I know you put a lot of effort into getting the art
done for the gatefold. Do you have a vision for your label that goes beyond
the audio side of it? FaltyDL Yeah, absolutely. And not only that, but it’s surrounding myself with some of
my best friends who are artists, who are going to be doing the work with me.
My friend Tom, who is going to build the website. He doesn’t
really know this yet, but Tom, you’re gonna build the website for me, and the
artwork and everything. And also, it’s a brand, so we really gotta think
about what we are going to use for a while, just like anything. Like, I think
that’s why I wanted this (picks up “Hardcourage” 12") on this old ’93 Ninja Tune sleeve. It’s just
cool because I haven’t seen it in a long time, and I saw it on a wall and was
like, “Can we use that?” And they were like, “Yeah.” So it was like, “Let’s
do that.” Anyways, I have a song that I’m gonna release from this fella, named
Brrd. It’s gonna come out this year (laughs). I’m being realistic. (music: Brrd – “SCOCJ2”) Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Benji B Forthcoming Blueberry Records, right? FaltyDL Blueberry Records. I just think there’s a patience in his production
which I just do not possess. And he’s about ten years younger than me. Benji B From New York? FaltyDL Boston, I think, or Denver, I never know. ’Cause he’s like from one and in
school in the other. Or he’s gone to school in both and from one. Benji B And talking of New York, obviously that’s where we are for this year’s Academy,
and as you’re not a native New Yorker but you live here right now, what’s it
like, musically speaking? Just on a music level, what’s the scene saying at
the moment for you, and what’s it like living here in musical terms? FaltyDL There’s a lot of options these days. I mean, on a Friday, Saturday night
there’s a few things going on, definitely. There’s always been a few nights
going on, here and there, and very relevant nights, not just like, “Yeah,
New York has a great house scene and great hip-hop scene,” but like, really
current, relevant nights. But now there’s these nights that are also
record labels, and also have a larger sort of presence in pop culture in
New York as well, or not pop culture – culture in New York. So they’re
stronger and there’s a lot more people going out to them, and I think it’s
pretty easy to start a night. There’s all these spaces out in Brooklyn
where people will travel to go to. I just saw a 40,000 square foot warehouse
the other day which I wanna throw a party in, and I’m just thinking how many
security guards I’m gonna need to rent for that. And how many police I’m gonna have
to pay off. Just kidding. Yeah, there’s a lot going on and there’s these
young kids – I think when you were here last, we went to that Astro Nautico
party which was thrown by a bunch of kids that are in their early twenties
and stuff. And it’s really exciting. I’m not that old, but I feel like I’m
older than a lot of the people at a lot of these parties I go to, but it’s
exciting to see that type of energy there. I guess even when I was their age
I guess I didn’t have that outlet. So it’s pretty cool. Benji B It is. Alright, let’s open it out to questions, if anyone’s got any questions
from the floor. If not, we’re just gonna play more music really loud (laughter). It’s alright, I’ll give you another 30 seconds... 28... 25... Yeah, alright. Audience Member Hi, what’s up? FaltyDL Hey. Audience Member I watched that Real Scenes New
York with you and I remember you
wrote on Twitter that they only used one of the lines you said? Do you want to
expand more on like what you think about living in New York and what you
said but they didn’t use? FaltyDL Yeah! I mean, the Real Scenes series is incredibly well-produced and they all
have this unifying, dystopic film over whatever city they’re looking
at. Which is great, it’s interesting. But it’s only sort of one side, and
a city like New York you’d need to film for like three or four months to
get enough interviews to really get an accurate portrayal of all the scenes
that are going on. But I think I got caught saying something like, “It makes me disgusted, the gentrification in the area.” Which
I’m obviously a part of, you know? But what I think I
then felt like I needed to say, and what most people who know me would
agree, is that I feel incredibly blessed to live in New York and make a living
off of making music. I mean, if I’m complaining, smack me. I don’t know why I
should be complaining about what it is I’m doing. But I guess there’s a
couple things going on – the idea of being misquoted is kind of frustrating, or
taken out of context. But what are you going to do? Audience Member You love New York then? FaltyDL I do, yeah very much. I could see myself staying here for a long time. Or
moving to Barcelona. (Laughter) So one of the two. Audience Member Good. FaltyDL Yeah. Benji B Any more questions? Audience Member Hi. FaltyDL Hey. Audience Member I wanted to know if there was ever a point in your life that you felt that
you had little or no personal life because of your work and how you
maintain a balance. And then, when you play a song later – I know you’ll play
another song before we go – could you tell us a really cool story about
it? FaltyDL A cool story, about it? Audience Member Yeah, or choose a song that you know has a really interesting story. FaltyDL Of how anti-social I was when I made that record? (Laughter) Yeah, I mean, specifically when I first moved to New York, I had two cousins living here and a couple of friends, because it’s not far from New Haven. You
sort of either go to Boston or New York if you want to get out of New Haven.
So, I came here and it was at a time when I really wasn’t partying. I
wasn’t drinking, I was really a straight-edge, tattooed kind of
fella. And for the first year and a bit I did not go out on Fridays or
Saturday nights, or any real nights. I mean, I’d go meet friends but I was home
at eight o’clock, nine o’clock at night, making music ’till 3 AM and
then getting up and then working part-time at a school as a substitute teacher
and then in the afternoon taking classes at City College. So all of that left me very isolated. But I had the options, my phone would ring and they would be
like, “Hey Drew, come out, there’s this party.” And I’d be like “Nah, I’m
cool.” I think partly it was because I wasn’t partying, drinking and stuff.
But I was so onto something, and early on I got the heads up from
Planet Mu to release some records and I was like, “OK, what’s more important than me
making an album right now?” I was weighing it against going out and
meeting people and I was like, “This is just a lot safer and more fun, just
stay home and make music.” But yeah, I was just getting lack of Vitamin B and
whatever it is you get from the sun after a while. I was very anti-social when
I was making records, for sure. Oh, should I play a record and tell a cool
story? Benji B “Mean Streets”? FaltyDL Yeah, why not? This is cool, this is number one. Benji B What’s the story about “Mean Streets”? FaltyDL I sent a bunch of tracks to Loefah through Dave Q, a mutual friend who
is a long-time promoter and all-round music lover here in New York, and
he passed a bunch of tunes onto Loefah for me and then I went and did a
Rinse FM in like 2010, I think with Loefah and a couple other people. And he was like, “In
what way did you send me those tunes?” Or something like that. And I was
like, “What do you mean?” And he was like, “In what capacity did you send me
those tunes?” Not really elaborating. And I was like, “Do you want to release
some of those tunes?” And he was like, “Yeah,” and I was like, “Alright, let’s
do it!” I make new tunes all the time and send them to him and he doesn’t even
check them. He just wants to release the ones I sent him in, like, 2009. So
these are all old tunes. I’m going to play the first track off part
two, and there’s a part three that’s hopefully going to come out this year.
Say what? Benji B Is this the sort of Tony Allen
influence? FaltyDL Yes, yeah, absolutely. I was listening to a lot of Fela Kuti
records and Tony Allen records, I think I brought Black
Voices in here
somewhere. And in fact, I think why a lot of these are limited and there’s no
digital [releases] is because there’s some pretty silly sampling going on that I would
not be able to pay for. (music: FaltyDL – “Mean Streets”) Benji B It’s always a good test if you see the sound engineer behind the glass having a
little dance – that’s always a good look, isn’t it? FaltyDL Yeah, he comes to all my gigs. Like, everywhere. Benji B Was that enough story for that tune? FaltyDL Yeah. Benji B Good. FaltyDL Was that a story? Benji B Yeah, you had a story. I think we had one more question just here, right? Can
we get a mic? Thanks. Audience Member Hey. You mentioned that you’d been playing at parties in Europe, and
obviously in the US. Have you noticed any differences in the crowd, or in the
things that you’ve visited? FaltyDL Yeah, definitely! I mean, I think every city’s different. To say just Europe
and America is different, I mean, every different city I’ve been to, and
every country is a different sort of scene. But what I find interesting is
when I’d show up to a gig in London in the first few years of touring and
play a very “London” set, and then the promoter would be like, “I thought you
were gonna play more of your own stuff for like a ‘New York’ set.” And I was
like, “Oh, yeah!” And it’s not because I was in London, it’s just... Audience Member What’s a “London” set? FaltyDL I don’t know. At the time, a lot of things that were on the front page of [music store] Boomkat?
I don’t know. I mean, did I play this? No, probably not. I mean, you
can’t just say, “Yeah, the internet, it’s amazing, everything travels so
quickly.” That’s kind of cliché, but in the last year, more than
any time in the last four or five years, I think music is traveling so far, so
fast that you can get away with playing anything anywhere, and it sort of has
an appropriate context. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but I think probably
way too much about these types of things and I have a hard time articulating
them – but yeah, there’s definitely a difference. Everywhere. Audience Member Alright, cheers. Benji B Any more questions? Audience Member Speaking as a record label person, I guess I wondered about the whole
idea of record labels having some push and pull with an artist to put a record
out. Sometimes you feel like you’re trying to make a better record, maybe?
Or a record that you have envisioned. And sometimes the artist agrees and
sometimes they don’t. And you put out a record with an artist and you’re not
going to have any input into what they’re doing at all. I guess it was just
kind of a... This is not really a question. It is a question, but I don’t have
a way to phrase it. FaltyDL It’s your defense. Audience Member No, no, no, it’s not a defense. It’s like, we’ve existed as a record
label for 20 years, the first ten years we had a lot of influence into the way
record came out, the second ten years, the record industry changed so much there
seemed to be no longer a need to do that. But I think sometimes that does make
the records more… something? Maybe? I don’t know, interesting, possibly? Maybe
not, but... FaltyDL Well, I mean you wouldn’t really know unless you released both versions, you
know what I mean? Audience Member Yeah. FaltyDL There’s definitely artists that need a little bit of quality control
and artists that you can just let them do their thing and they really know
what they’re doing, you know? The tracks they want to release, I mean… it
sounds like you know more about it than I do. Audience Member Well, I mean I work with artists that have started their own record labels
and it’s interesting to see that transition, from being an artist who’s
putting out a record with you, to them then being a record label having
artists put out records with them. FaltyDL Well, if I get to put out a second record then I did my first one right, I
guess. We’ll see. Benji B One last question over here, then it’s tea time. Audience Member Hey, thanks for being here. How much do you think about your perceived
audience when you’re making music, and do you think about it at all? FaltyDL Define perceived audience. Audience Member The audience you imagine that you have. I mean, you see your audience at your
shows, but to a certain extent as an artist you can only have this
vague idea of who they are and what they are, because you don’t know every one
of them. FaltyDL I think about that during the compiling stage, but when I’m actually making a
track I’m really not thinking about anyone, including myself. Hopefully I’m
just on auto-pilot and just listening, and just sort of creating. Sincerely.
Although, I think that’s probably when I fail, when I’m thinking and I’m
worried about how it’s going to sound anyway. I mean, I think about
soundsystem culture and I think about, “Is this going to sound good on a
system in a club?“ And that’s changed the way I mix my records down now. But
yeah, I think the less I can think about anyone, the better the art is, in a
way. Benji B Great, well, please let’s say thanks a lot, Drew. Cheers. FaltyDL Let’s go make some music.
Skream and those guys were
coming over and playing right here, for like 10 bucks, down the street. It was
cool.

Gabriel Roth
Few people have the same amount of soul as Daptone label boss Gabriel Roth. Started on a shoestring, with its headquarters and House of Soul studios in Bushwick, Brooklyn, this venerable imprint takes a distinctly analog approach to its art. Over the years, its roster of artists – including the late Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley – have gone from cult curiosities to genuinely global soul stars.
In this lecture for the 2010 Red Bull Music Academy, Roth reveals his idiosyncratic recording techniques and why it pays to keep your sound as raw and authentic as possible.
Hosted by Jeff “Chairman” Mao Welcome to the afternoon lecture. Normally, you wouldn’t see me doing the afternoon lecture after doing the noon lecture, but we are just breaking all the rules today. That is just how special today is. And making it even more special is this gentleman here on the couch next to me. He is in charge of a wonderful music label known as Daptone Records. He has flown in today fresh off the plane straight from the airport. Didn’t even go to his room, came straight here to be with you. And please join me in welcoming him, Gabriel Roth. Gabriel Roth Thank you. Thank you for having me. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Good to see you, man. How are you? Gabriel Roth I am doing real well, it is good to see everybody. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Welcome, yes. We had Mark Ronson here earlier, you know this gentleman? Gabriel Roth I do, I know him well. He’s a good guy, and almost everything he was telling you is true. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Almost everything. At some point we will get to the point that it’s complete lies and expose that. But anyway, Mark as you have heard, has worked with some of the musicians that Gabe also works with, as well as yourself? Gabriel Roth We did a lot of music for Mark, the Amy Winehouse record, we did about six of the songs, we did all the music for him. Jeff “Chairman” Mao But, as I said earlier, usually I like to try and introduce our guests with a little piece of music. So Gabe, can you operate this machine over here properly? [Gestures to turntable] Gabe is going to play something from his repertoire at Daptone Records. (music: Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings feat. Lee Fields – “Stranded in Your Love”) Jeff “Chairman” Mao So tell us what was that we just heard. Gabriel Roth That was a song called “Stranded.” It is a duet between Lee Fields and Sharon Jones, something I did a few years ago for a record called Naturally, a Sharon Jones album. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I guess, explain, with this example in mind, your recording studio, where this was done and how the whole thing is set up. Mark started on it a little bit earlier, him walking through and being in heaven. But maybe you can explain a little bit more definitively exactly what this studio is set up like. Gabriel Roth The studio is an old two-family house in Bushwick, Brooklyn, a real nasty neighborhood. But we were able to rent this house out there, and it’s a real beat-up house. On the top floor we have offices and on the ground floor, we have a studio, which we built, just ourselves. It’s not real big but it’s all analog with no computers in there. There are computers upstairs, we’ve got to make some money and sell some records, but downstairs is just tape machines. We have a CD burner in there, but other than that, we don’t have any digital reverbs or anything. It’s all springs and plates and microphones and tape machines, and mostly good musicians is kind of the key. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I guess, what was the philosophy of putting things together this way? Gabriel Roth I think the advantage I had coming into the whole thing, as far as the music industry, is that I never really wanted to be in the music industry. I never really wanted to be a record producer or a record label owner or even a musician. I didn’t have any lofty aspirations in that way. I wanted to be a math teacher. I played music at college, I was in bands, but I never really considered it as a serious occupation and I just kind of fell into it with Philippe Lehman. He was this guy, who I knew, who Jeff knows, too. He was a record collector and started putting out compilations and reissues of really rare funk stuff in the ’90s, I guess, the early ’90s. I moved to New York and got really into the records and then he moved to New York from Paris, and he was looking to produce records, and he didn’t know anything about that. Somehow, a mutual friend hooked us up and I knew a little bit about engineering and arranging and stuff like that. I was into the music, so we kind of hit it off and started making records. So, I kind of started making records just for fun and we did it in basements and wherever we could, and we did it the way we wanted to do it. We really loved all those old funk records and old soul records and stuff, so we did everything really raw and real distorted and we didn’t give a f--- what anybody wanted us to do or what the things sounded like. I had never worked in a professional recording studio at that point. I didn’t really care what anybody thought, and for me, that turned out to be a huge advantage, because I think one of the reasons I’ve been successful is that I’ve done stuff my way and it has been so far outside of what’s going on, as opposed to working in a studio and learning, “This is the way you’re supposed to mic a snare drum; this is the way you supposed to do this; this is the way you do art work and this is the way you sell records.” We would put out records with made-up names and made-up titles, made-up stories, and people would ask for pictures of the band and we’d say there isn’t one. We didn’t care. We weren’t really planning on, like, “How can we be a legitimate record label?” We were just having fun, and it just kind of kept going very slowly and organically over the years. Desco stopped and Neal Sugarman and I started Daptone. And as that went, building the studio and everything, it was kind of the same approach from the beginning… just concentrating on doing things how we want to do them and they can become the records we want to hear, as opposed to what we thought would sell and what wouldn’t sell. And because of that, I think, we have been real successful. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Let’s back up a little bit. I want to get a bit more detail on what you just talked about with Desco and how you got started, because a lot of the same personnel is involved doing a lot of different things. Daptone is the label and the recording studio in Bushwick. Who is on Daptone? Gabriel Roth It’s a pretty small family of singers and musicians. Our biggest act is Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, they do real well. Our last record with them sold about 150,000 copies, which is a lot, considering we are not working with any major label or a major label distribution or promotion or anything. It’s all independent out of this house in Brooklyn. So that’s our biggest act. We also have the Budos Band, which is kind of an instrumental Afro soul psychedelic band, and Naomi Shelton & the Gospel Queens, which is a real kind of soulful gospel act and Charles Bradley, Binky Griptite and a number of different things, one-off 45s, the Menahan Street Band. It is strange, because we have done pretty well, but not a lot people have heard of us. We are a very small independent label, a lot of music we have done has actually gone on to be… in the last couple of years, there is “Roc Boys,” the big Jay-Z song... Jeff “Chairman” Mao Jay-Z’s “Roc Boys” sampled one of your records. Gabriel Roth There was a Rhymefest one… A lot of hip-hop samples have come from our records and end up on the radio, so it is strange to me to hear this weird kind of underground stuff we are doing in Brooklyn on the radio. And then, of course, what Mark was talking about, the Amy Winehouse and some other pop stuff… people have hired us to do productions for them. It’s strange, because we have a certain amount of clout in this kind of underground scene and a lot of pop producers know who we are. We don’t have any kind of celebrity on that scale in the general public; people don’t know who we are. It’s kind of nice. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Let’s go back for a minute and just talk a little bit about how you got involved. You mentioned Desco and Philippe Lehman. Philippe Lehman was a French-born Parisian record collector, super, super, heavy, heavy-duty, soul and funk 45 record collector and DJ. Gabriel Roth He is out of his mind… he is completely out of his mind. It was great. He would have these crazy ideas, he would say, “Let’s do a sitar funk album.” And I’d be like, “OK,” and he would say, “We’ll do it this weekend.” At the time, we were renting studio time at this heavy metal rehearsal studio out on Long Island, where they would give us day rates real cheap, and we would go out in three days and do an album. So, we were going out there in the car and I’d say, “Who is the sitar player?” He’d say, “I rented the sitar, it’s in the back seat, you’ve got to figure it out.” I made this record, it’s pretty awful, but it is a record of James Brown and Meters covers, weird things, with me figuring out how to play the sitar. The thing was that he was just crazy enough to try stuff like that, and because of that, I think, he had a big influence on my approach to how you make records, which is “Just do whatever you want to do, and if it sounds good, it’s good, and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t.” Jeff “Chairman” Mao So you were playing whatever came up? Bass, guitars… Gabriel Roth I used to play drums in high school. I was a drummer for a long time. And luckily, since I met Homer Steinweiss, who has got a great sound on the drums, and a lot of other drummers I work with, they are all much better than I ever was, so I don’t have to do that any more. But then I started playing bass because I couldn’t find a bass player – they all wanted to be guitar players and were all playing a lot and I want to someone just to go dum, dum, which is pretty easy to learn. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So those days, what years are we talking about now? Gabriel Roth ’95, ’96, ’97. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Who else was involved, as far as personnel goes, with you and Philippe? Gabriel Roth Binky Griptite was one of the first people I hooked up with, who is still with us in the Dap-Kings as a guitar player and MC and singer… an MC/announcer, he is not a rapper. Homer Steinweiss is playing with a different band called the Mighty Imperials and Neil Sugarman at the time had this boogaloo soul group, the Sugarman 3, and I produced about three records for him. He later went on to become my partner now in Daptone Records and he still plays with the Dap-Kings and does a lot of stuff too. Fernando “Boogaloo” Velez, a conga player who has been around 15 years. It has been a real family affair the whole time, which has been real nice. A lot of the same people in other bands in New York, there’s kind of a whole scene. Antibalas, this Afrobeat band; a lot of us play with that band and a lot of people are just going back and forth between different bands. Some started touring more and you have to pick a horse and ride it. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I guess, the first time, maybe even before I met you, I remember reading an article you had written in this UK fanzine called Big Daddy, which was hip-hop-related, but also very much in tune with funk and soul resurgence that was happening at the time towards the end of the ’90s. Around the time of “Brainfreeze” by DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist doing their thing and stuff like that. You wrote an article entitled “Shitty is Pretty, Anatomy of a Heavy Funk 45,” and I wonder if you could explain a little bit about that philosophy and your mindset when you were doing those recordings and writing that article? Gabriel Roth Man, I didn’t know what I was talking about when I wrote that, I didn’t know what I was doing. It was the same thing I was talking about, this philosophy that if you wanted something to sound rough and raw, and like the live recordings and the kind of recordings I was enjoying at the time, that had to be your approach to making it, you had to do it live. A lot of people are really into vintage equipment, for example, valve gear, ribbon microphones, all kind of things like that. And as we have got more successful and I have got more money in the studio and stuff, we’ve got some stuff like that. But the key was, especially the first records I was making, there was a lot of microphones from RadioShack – it’s like a cheap electronics store. You buy a microphone for like $5 or $10 to plug in your Walkman. I was using those kind of microphones. I recorded a record with Bernard Purdie playing drums with RadioShack mics hanging over his head. And just the kind of approach, being able to use whatever you have and just rely on the performance of the musicians and your ears… to use whatever you had to get what you want, and that kind of guerrilla approach to recording – really raw stuff. The funny thing is that that article kind of haunts me. Every week I get emails from people who’ve read that article and say, “Wow, that’s great, I’m going to do it.” And I keep thinking, “Man, don’t listen to me, there’s some crazy stuff in there.” Jeff “Chairman” Mao I’m going to quote from the article a few excerpts here. This is from “Shitty is Pretty, Anatomy of a Heavy Funk 45” by Gabriel Roth: “Parts of an arrangement must be brutally repetitive. If you can’t get into the idea of playing one chord for a whole song, put down this magazine and go find yourself a nice Beatles songbook… It’s best to get time-machine players, genuine old-school players who think they are still in 1971, or those who are so into rough shit that they can willfully deny the influence of the last 30 years on their own playing.” And you also have some “never” rules, never do this, never do that. “With respect to rhythm, never have two hands playing on a hi-hat, unless it is 1970 and you’re in Ghana. Never slap your thumb on a bass. A mean drum break will make even white people bite their bottom lips and bop their heads up and down like abandoned monkeys.” Which is actually true. “Be also advised not to overuse breaks, because breaks are like antibiotics, if we prescribe them to everybody in a few years we will all be immune to them.” I think actually there is a lot of wisdom in some of these things. But I am curious to know, the philosophy back then for you, obviously, coming in was really do-it-yourself, real punk rock in a way. Gabriel Roth I would not believe everything you read in a magazine, but it was real punk rock. Exactly, it was punk rock and it’s still punk rock in a strange way. Even our record label, the business side of it, the independent side of it… But a big part arrangement-wise was just talking about the discipline that musicians don’t seem to have any more. A lot of musicians will complain about producers using drum machines and samples and loops, and I think part of the reason why they started doing that is because drummers can’t go more than four bars without playing a drum fill any more. Everybody was trying to play, everybody wanted to be a virtuoso all the time, and they didn’t understand. Even horn players don’t quite understand that much any more how to be part of a section. When I listen to all my favorite records, be it James Brown or Cuban orchestras from the ’40s or some reggae stuff… whatever it is, one of the things that I really love in musicians is the ability to kind of make one sound and to be able to understand that each person playing one note is so significant. It’s more important to play one note just right than to play a whole bunch of notes. I think that’s one reason why jazz has gone to complete shit and musicians are out of work, and people are using samples is because people don’t know how to play with the same kind of groove anymore. So, the biggest resource we have at Daptone is having access to these musicians that are all of the same philosophy. You can’t bring ego, you can’t be part of a band if you’re playing like that. Because of that, we’re able to make records that other people are sampling, because the musicians on the record are playing with that kind of discipline, that kind of togetherness, that kind of awareness of the whole part of the arrangement. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Can you give an example? Play something that sort of exemplifies what you are talking about? Gabriel Roth Yeah, I can give an example. This is a test pressing of this new Sharon Jones album we are working on, and there is a song on here called “Give It Back” and the trumpet player, Dave Guy, wrote the song. The main part he wrote was this guitar hook that went [sings guitar hook] kind of real picky – a Smokey Robinson guitar hook – and it was kind of the main part of the song. We had these two kind of complicated guitar parts going through the whole song, and when we went into the studio to do it, I started working on an arrangement for it. We put a little bit of strings on it, and we put great background vocals on it, vibes and a couple of things… just sparse, just to be sparse with the arrangement. Anyway, while I was mixing it – somebody earlier asked a question about having too much stuff and getting stuff too thick – I was mixing it and I had all these faders up, and I could get the rhythm section sounding really good. There was all this arrangement stuff, and it was just too much, it was just way too much going on. At some point we figured out, if I just turned the guitars off, it sounded better. So I just went back in and put another guitar on it, took out the guitars and just put [sings guitar] and it kind of holds the arrangement together. You can hear in the background the other guitars bleeding through. It’s funny to play this example because what you’re listening to is the part that you don’t hear. It’s the idea of playing nothing that kind of hooks it up a little bit. (music: Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings – “Give it Back”) Jeff “Chairman” Mao So wait, what was the name of that? Gabriel Roth I think it is called “Give it Back,” it’s on the new Sharon Jones record. But the point is that one guitar is just playing [sings simple line] and if you listen to a lot of records you have, the thing is, you will find a record, one of your favorite records or what you are influenced by… there is a record that has an amazing guitar part on it, and there is a record that has a great vocal on it, and there is a record that has an amazing drum pattern and a great bassline. But it’s not the same record, they’re all different records. The reason why there is room for someone to play a great bassline is because some guitar player is playing [sings simple guitar part]. And some other record, the reason why there’s room for a great guitar part is because the bass player was playing [sings simple bassline]. That’s it. You need that kind of openness. And that is one of the things… I don’t want to say progress, but as far as the development of my arrangements and stuff, I’ve been having more discipline and learning more about space. The phrase is, I guess, to kill your babies: get your favorite idea, the thing you like most and just throw it in the garbage. Working on a record, I find that I do a lot of that. I might stay up all night for five nights on something and I’ll work on it and get this arrangement, this amazing horn arrangement that’s like a Bach chorale, like the most genius thing and I’m patting myself on the back all the way to work and some horn player says, “Hey, what if we just go harum, blat.” And it takes a lot, it is hard to take yourself far enough out of it to go, “You know what? You’re right.” And there was some of that, there is the idea that music isn’t about necessarily being a genius. That’s another reason why people started sampling and using computers to make music, because computers are stupid, and if people had more discipline and were prepared to play something stupid and just use a lot of balls and a lot of feeling… People play too much, there is way too much playing. Jeff “Chairman” Mao So, you are never tempted to take a bass solo and just like slap the shit out of it? Gabriel Roth Oh man, no. I’m not tempted to do that. I think that is the biggest thing with our approach to music, just that the musicians and the arrangement is paramount. And if that’s right, then the rest is going to fall together. For me, personally, I think the biggest challenge, as far as being a producer and trying to make a record, is trying to be inside of it and outside of it at the same time. Inside of it, in a way that I need to have my ear on the arrangement when it’s going down. I need to hear if somebody is out of tune, I need to hear if one violin is louder than some other violin and if the harmony is off balance. I need to hear all the details of it. Engineering-wise, I do all the engineering and stuff on here, and I have to hear what is going on with every detail, and if the mic pre-amp is distorting… whatever, those kind of things. But, at the same time, you need to be far enough outside of it, so you can listen to it, not like a producer or a musician, or even a music writer. You need to listen to it like somebody who works at a coffee shop and it’s their favorite record going home. You need to be able to listen to it like a human being, just listen to how it makes you feel, and that’s really hard a lot of times with music because you get so inside of it and you are so inside of your ideas about what’s going to work and what’s not going to work. It’s hard to let go of things sometimes. Especially engineering-wise –there are all those magazines telling you what equipment is good and who used what equipment, and how you’re supposed to use it and how amazing it’s going to sound, and how they made this hit record or that hit record. Man, if you listen to that stuff, you get really confused and get so far inside of the process that you’re not able to hear what you are doing. I do a lot of blind listening in the studio, meaning I will have two or three mics and plug them in, but I won’t know which one is plugged in where. So, I go back into the control room and I may have some $3,000 RCA ribbon microphone from the ’50s on the horns, but I also might have a RadioShack mic or an SM-57 or a condenser, and some other things, and it might be a $10 mic or a $1,000 mic. But not knowing the difference makes you listen to it differently, really differently. And if you know which mic is on which channel, you have these assumptions. You start listening to all the things you read in the magazine, “Man, listen, this one is warm. That one’s got a little more punch to it, doesn’t it?” Or, “Oh yeah, just a bit more clarity on the high-end,” and it’s all bullshit. If you don’t know which mic is which, you’re not going to talk that way because you don’t want to accidentally say the wrong thing about the wrong mic. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Mic might get mad at you. Gabriel Roth Sometimes you’ll find that that fancy old mic can sound great, but that $5 mic can sound better. So I’m always hesitant, especially when people ask, “What kind of tape machine are you using?” Or, “What kind of gear are you using?”, because I think it’s very distracting. There weren’t a lot of people asking, you know, what type of paintbrush is Picasso using? Picasso is Picasso because he’s Picasso. Not that I’m Picasso, but the musicians are playing the music. It’s not the engineer, it’s not the equipment that is doing it, it’s not the arranger. You can do certain things to make it sound good but at the end of it, it is more about getting out of the way. This new Sharon Jones record we did on an eight-track machine, which I’ve found is a big advantage. A lot of people now, there is a very strange progress in recording technology, especially since digital technology came along, but even before that, where things became about isolation and options. How many options can you have? How many tracks can you have? How isolated are they? Because later in the mix you can do different things, you can do overdubs, you can do whatever you want, and I think that’s a useful tool for some people. All of it is just a tool, whatever helps you do it, but I think in the process of that there is something misguided. In the old days, when people made records there was a certain craftsmanship to it, a certain amount of commitment on the part of the musicians and the arrangers and the engineers. On this record, we did all of the orchestra on one track in one day for the whole album. The way we did it was I spent weeks working on the arrangements, getting the arrangements just right. I went over to one of the violinists and made sure everything looked right on the page first, and made sure it was musically what we wanted. Then before we even went to the studio, I was already cutting parts out. “This is going to be too busy, we don’t need this part.” And a lot of the times it was the best part of the string arrangement, but maybe that’s right where Sharon was singing some amazing part, I didn’t want to take away from what she was doing. So we got to the studio, it’s a small studio. The live room is about the size of that part of the room over there. It’s pretty small, but I set up four violins and two cellos and a timpani, and I put a mic on the violins and a mic on the timpani. In the isolation room I put glockenspiel and timpani and a mic there and I ran them all through a balance mixer to one track. So, as the arrangement was going down, we had a copy of the score on the mixing board, and as they were rehearsing the arrangement we would work out, “OK, at the bridge we have got to turn up the timpani a little bit and we’ve got to turn it down on the verse. We want to turn up the glockenspiel.” All these decisions, once it goes down – balancing them out too, moving the microphone around, telling the cellists they’ve got to dig into a certain part, making all the decisions, listening while you do it. It takes a kind of craftsmanship and commitment. You have to know what you’re doing and you have to listen to it and know right then, “This is what I want the record to sound like.” And then it hits the tape and that’s it. When I went to mix the record it’s orchestra track eight. That is it. And the thing about that is that a lot of people think that is intimidating, or even kind of impressive in a way, because right now people aren’t doing that that much. If people are recording an orchestra, it is recorded piece by piece on a lot of different tracks and it’s reassembled later. But the thing is, when I’m mixing them together and deciding on what’s happening in the arrangements, those decisions are going to have to be made anyway. My point is, I don’t think I’m going to be any smarter when I mix the record than when I track the record. I don’t think it’s like I’m going to track the record and then later on in the mix, I’m going to say, “Oh, the magic key was to do…,” you know? I make mistakes and sometimes the trumpet is too loud and you don’t hear the congas or something on the record. But that’s OK. It shouldn’t be perfect. It’s a record. Part of the live feeling you hear on old records are the imbalances and imperfections and the spontaneity of it. You hear old records, and there is a really loud tambourine, and you don’t hear the vocal and on the next song you hear a really loud guitar and the drums are low. Things are in different places and they’re weird, and nowadays records all sound exactly the same. It is always drums and bass and vocals right down the middle and they’re always really loud, and everything else is sprinkled tastefully across the horizon, so you can hear every little piece of everything and that is a mix. Once that is done and the kick drum hits zero dB, that is a mix. I just think there is a lot more freedom. You can do anything you want to a record. You can put the whole band on the left and a tambourine on the right side. There’s no reason why you can’t do that. It sounds crazy, but if you listen to it and it feels good, then there’s no reason not to do it. The only reason not to do that is if you’re trying to get signed by Sony. If you’re trying to get a major record deal, and you want to talk to A&R people and you are going to deal with a bunch of sycophants that are looking to try and chase the next formulaic pop radio hit so that you can have the next superstar pop hit, then don’t listen to anything I’m talking about, because I don’t know anything about that. The only way I’m going to get on there is because they’re going to sample what we did that’s all screwed up sounding and they’re going to put the bass drum back in the middle. It’s a strange situation. The other thing about it, having eight tracks – and what some people consider a limitation about it – the other thing I think is that it enhances the recording process for the musicians. If you think about being a musician in a studio and, say, you’re doing a saxophone solo and you play it live with the band and it feels pretty good, but you’re not sure and you go back in the control room and you say, “I think I could do it better.” If you’ve got a computer, you could sit there for a few hours, play six or seven solos, there is no pressure. You don’t know what’s going to be on the record. They might take a note from this or a note from that, they’ll figure it out later. If you’re out of tune, they will fix it. If you’re out of time, they’ll move it over. They will take the best one, if the first is the best one, then it’s the first one… when you’re in the studio with me, if you play a saxophone solo and you are going to tape, you come back in the control room and say, “Oh man, I don’t really like that solo, I feel I could do better,” I say, “Well, if you feel you can do better, then do better because I’ll record over the last one. It’s gone.” And that may seem like a limitation, and technology is there so that you don’t have to do that, but if you think about being a musician, when you go in there and play the next solo, what happens? Your spine is tingling. You’re playing what is going to be on the record. You’re recording over something and doing something permanent. It really puts a musician in the sense of now, in the sense of performance, and that’s the liveness you hear on records. It’s not even necessarily people being in the same room, it’s about people playing with commitment, with balls, saying that, “This is the part and I’m playing it right now.” That’s not to say that everything is completely live and there is no control + Z undo button. We do splices – we splice together different takes. I do it with a razor blade… if we have to, we will splice something in – but it takes a lot more effort and craftsmanship to do that with tape. It puts a lot more pressure on you to know what you’re doing. It puts pressure on musicians and singers to know what they’re doing. Everybody’s got to do it right. It’s strange because I think, talking to people especially about this record but the last few records we’ve done, you know, I had a 16-track machine for a minute. I went from a four-track machine to an eight-track machine to 16-track machine, and then everyone wanted to lend me 24-track machines, and I got rid of it and went back to the eight-track machine. Nobody could understand what I was doing. But really, being in the studio with an eight-track machine is amazing, it is a different process. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Obviously, you stick to your philosophy of how you want to do things and trying to maintain some sense of spontaneity and the music being alive. But how conscious are you of being thought of as trapped in a style that seems to be undeniably retro? Gabriel Roth I am not really conscious of it at all. I don’t feel trapped. We make any type of record we want to. If I want to make a country record with a disco beat, then that’s what I’ll do. We recently put out an a cappella gospel record, which very few people bought. But we didn’t really think people would buy it; we just liked it, so we put it out. We put ourselves in a position because we’re completely independent, we don’t owe anybody money, we’re not under contract to anybody, there is nobody that can pull the plug on us or tell us what to do. We do whatever we want to do. We’re not really trapped by genre. The reason why we make records sound like that is because those are the records we dig. Like I said, I have never had ambitions about the music industry, especially about pop music or something. I never listen to the radio, I still don’t listen to the radio. I don’t know what is going on with that stuff. And I don’t have any problem with that, I’m not one of these people who has some kind of an agenda, like old is better and analog is better and digital is bad. I don’t care, man. It is music. Music is supposed to make you feel good, and that’s got to be the end of it. If it doesn’t make you feel good, it’s wrong, and if it does, then it’s right and that’s it. Different people like different music and that’s how it should be. As far as being trapped in a genre, we make the records exactly how we want to make them, and we’re not trapped at all. I think it is kind of the opposite. If you think about how much music there has been, if you are coming down from outer space and you just looked at recorded music, you’re talking about a hundred years of recorded music. And not just one hundred years, but internationally, there is music from all over the world. Beyond a hundred years, you have Beethoven and sheet music going back hundreds of years, so there is all this music to be influenced by and to play. You could be playing South African music. There is a million types of music, a million genres and, to me what’s trapped is to listen to the five songs that are on rotation on whatever the pop radio station is, and to try to do something that people who like that are going to like. That is trapped, man. Trapped is when you don’t sell 500,000 records and you lost money. That’s a trap, man. I am the furthest thing from being trapped. I do whatever I want to do and I can sell 500 records or two records and I’m not going out of business and nobody is going to fire me. I don’t think we’re trapped. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I guess talk a little bit about running the label on your own terms, and how it has been kind of fortuitous in a way. We were just talking at lunch about the record industry vanishing and going down the toilet, but that has been an advantage for you in some respects, doing things the way you want to do them. Gabriel Roth I think it is an advantage for us in a lot of respects. Obviously, the internet is a big thing that lets people have a lot more choice in what they want to listen to. I think major labels complain a lot about all the technology in the last few years wiping them out, and they talk about piracy and people copying CDs and downloads. I don’t think that’s what hurt them. I think the thing that really hurt them is that, all of a sudden, if you are in the middle of Idaho or Mongolia, if you have internet access, you can listen to any type of music you want, where it used to be that you had to listen to what was on the radio. You had to listen to whatever your local Wal-Mart or whatever the shop was… That is what I think is what is killing the major labels; they can’t compete with that kind of choice or that kind of consumer. They developed this model more and more that was based on these huge-selling records, and they can’t make money off a record that sells 1,000 copies. And where it used to be maybe a hundred people would buy a hundred different records… let me not make a really confusing example here, I don’t want to make it a math test – it used to be that a lot of people would buy the same kind of music, and now people can buy whatever they want, whether it’s old music, new music or music from anywhere in the world or any genre. So, that helped us a lot. People are always talking about the sky is falling in the music industry, but I think it’s a wonderful time and we’ve had a lot of prosperity – even with the economy and stuff we do really well. And I think it’s a great time for artists and for musicians. Musicians never made money off record sales anyway. Anyone who is a musician and thinks they can to make money out of royalties, it has never happened. Unless you are the Rolling Stones, it really doesn’t happen. The way you make money is from publishing, from playing live shows, from selling T-shirts and key chains – this is how you make money. From having a song in a bank commercial, you can make money like that. You’re not going to make money from some record company giving you a royalty check. You may get an advance but you’ll probably blow it anyway. When they talk about CD sales falling, musicians are not really getting hit by that as much as major record companies. Major record companies are falling to pieces now, they’re scrambling and eating their own tails and they keep trying to think of new ways to sell music and new ways to market music. But what they don’t do is just try to make good records. They’re so distracted by what’s going to work and what’s going to sell a million copies, and, “What if we make a free download with a can of Pepsi?” And, “What if we make a video and how much of her tits can we show in the video?” They concentrate on anything other than, “Hey, what would be a cool record to make?” Once in a while, there is a weird record like that Buena Vista Social Club record or the Norah Jones record, it wasn’t supposed to sell and accidentally people hear it and buy it. Then the whole record industry scratches their head for a while. All of a sudden, they try to find somebody that sounds like Norah Jones or something. It is really bizarre. It is the same thing with the Amy Winehouse record, it is real weird, man. I give kudos to Mark [Ronson] because he is very different from me, and I think we work very well together because he has his head – he knows about the pop world and he is a lot deeper into the industry side of it than I am. It was real easy to come into our strange world and hear what was cool about what we were doing and kind of incorporate that into a pop thing. On the Winehouse record, he got our band and put her on it and then mixed it, used some mixer over here, some guy mixed it and made it sound like stuff on the radio. Really bright and lots of bottom end and really compressed and all kinds of shit that I don’t really dig. But again, the records I make are never going to be up on the No 1 spot on the radio. Anyway, after the Amy Winehouse record, which is a little bit weird, it was a bit strange for a record that was that pop to have those kinds of raw sounds on it. After that, all of a sudden, there was a lot of people contacting me… a lot of English singers, actually, young English girls and stuff contacting producers and stuff… “Oh, we want you to work on this record.” And it was just very strange. Nobody is ever able to learn from that stuff that the reason why these things are successful is because they’re good. It’s not a formula. It’s not because you put the bass drum on a certain way and you put the vocal on a certain way, and this is what makes a good record. A good record is just because it feels good and it’s always like that. There is always some record that you don’t want to like but you kind of like anyway. Everybody has these guilty pleasure records, and it is evidence. There’s things about certain records, “Oh man, I don’t like anything about that genre,” but there is one song or hook that is always in your head. That is it, it’s a good hook. That’s the reason – there is no other reason for it. I think if people could get back towards that, there would be a lot better records being made. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I have heard rumors that various people have approached you guys. I don’t know if any of them are true. Gabriel Roth None of it’s true. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Rod Stewart? Gabriel Roth That’s kind of true. [Laughter] That record came out, and we weren’t on it. They asked us to do some music with him, and we tried doing some things and it didn’t really work out. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Rod Stewart came to Brooklyn? Gabriel Roth No, but I was called into a meeting with Clive Davis. He is like the epitome of big-shot record executives. He shits hits. I am sitting across the desk from him and we’re trying to have a conversation, and it’s like we are speaking two different languages. I have no idea what he’s talking about and he has no idea what I’m talking about. Eventually, he gets me to produce this record and I said, “Man, you know what? No.” He was going to give me a lot of money, but I didn’t want to try and figure out how to please Clive Davis. I didn’t want to be sitting in the studio doing things over and over and waiting for him to say that it sounded like a pop hit. So, I told him, “Here is what I do, this is how I make records. If you want me to do arrangements for you, or if you want musicians, or if you want the studio, if you want me to engineer stuff, whatever you want me to do, I would love to work with you on it, but I’m not in charge of making that record.” He ended up hiring another producer to come and work with me on it, so I said, “Get somebody else to be the producer.” It didn’t actually end up working out. A lot of things don’t work out. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You have the memories and the story, which is a pretty good story. Gabriel Roth I’ll always have the memory. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You mentioned not making money off of royalties, just being able to be savvy enough to sell your shirts on tour and stuff like that. Touring is a huge part of what you guys do. I wonder if you might like to speak on that a bit. Gabriel Roth Actually, let me amend something about that, about royalties. I make money on royalties. But the reason I make money on royalties is because Daptone is me and Neil, and we have got Nydia who works for us, who also DJs with Jeff. Everybody knows each other, it’s a tight family. There’s like four of us, and if you have four people in a building selling records, you can make money off royalties. If you think about it, if Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings had a deal with Universal or something like that and we put out a big record, man, think how many people have got to eat off that record. How many do you have to sell before you start making money? A lot of records. We sell a few thousand records and we’re making money. So, I don’t want to say you can’t make money off royalties. I will just say, you can’t make money off royalties if you have a record deal with a major label. As far as touring, we do really well touring. We have been touring a lot and it has always been by far the best promotion we have ever had. Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings are a really great live act, and a lot of the acts on our label are really good live acts, and just being on the road and playing shows and having people tell their friends is the best promotion we can have. Another advantage that we have is that, because we have built very slowly, we would go to towns and play for 30 people, and then we would come back and play to 50 people, and we would come back and play to a hundred. Now there’s towns all over the world where we play to 1,000 or 2,000 people, and because it was so slow and gradual, all the people who are there are there because their friends told them about the show last time they went, or they heard the record themselves, or somebody played them the record. They’re there because of the music directly, or somebody they trust directly. If you compare that to having some overnight success, where you have a radio hit or your song’s in a movie, or you get caught snorting cocaine off a hooker’s ass or whatever it is, whatever these big celebrity ways are that make you famous, and you have a big record – and I am not saying they don’t cash out, because they do cash out – but the problem with that is where are those people two years later? They’re gone. You don’t hear about them any more. People don’t have careers like that any more. We have a lot of people that really love our label and the band, and we have a different kind of relationship with them, because they trust us and they have grown with us and they know the music. When you get people into your music that way, in that kind of grassroots way, you have fans for life, and you have loyal fans and you don’t have to spend the same kind of promotional money. You don’t have to go through the same kind of antics, jump through hoops, make million-dollar videos. Not that we don’t do promotion – especially for the Sharon Jones record, which is bigger, and we have started to spend some money on stuff – but for the most part, it’s all very organic word-of-mouth sort of stuff. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Can you tell us stories from the road? Some things that you experienced? Because I know, like you were saying, it built up over time, so there must’ve been some times when things weren’t so rosy at the beginning. Gabriel Roth The first time I ever came to the UK, actually it was ’98 or ’99 or something, and we did a tour. Man, we didn’t have hotels or anything, man. Every night at the club and after the gig everyone is talking to girls, and it was mostly because they really wanted to find a place to sleep. It gives a whole different meaning to the phrase “I slept with this girl last night,” like, “Really?” “Yeah, she had a beautiful bed.” In Ascot we played a club and ended up staying in the backstage. The guy didn’t want us to steal the liquor so he locked us is in the back. You don’t want to get too deep into road stories, because it gets real weird real quick. But we have traveled a lot. We’ve been to Australia about three times and we’ve been over here a bunch of times, in Europe a bunch of times and we tour a lot in the States. We paid a lot of dues, and we have come up very slowly but it’s been rewarding. We have a really good relationship with our audience and our fans and people who buy the records and come to the shows because of that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao We haven’t heard anything in a minute, do you want to share something else with us musically? Gabriel Roth Let me share something with you musically here. That Sharon Jones record, I was saying, we took a long time to record. There was a lot of arrangements and a lot to work on, but after that, I worked on that record for months. Mark and I were both working on a record at the same time and comparing notes as we went. It was just taking months and months, especially because we were out of town touring a lot. But, a couple of weekends ago, we did the new Budos Band record and we did it in two days, the whole album. We did the whole thing live in two days and mixed it in a few more days and it was really easy. So, I am going to play something off their new record. I’ve just got to figure out how to work this little thing. I am not great with this kind of technology. (music: The Budos Band – “Black Venom”) Gabriel Roth That record, we did it all in a day. And just to get all those weird psychedelic sounds and stuff, that is all tape delay and I didn’t use an Echoplex or anything like that. We did that record on the 16-track machine, and I had a bunch of extra tracks that way, and I used those tracks to make tape delays. You listen off the repro head, so you have it just timed between the chord head and the delay head. You send out an auxiliary back to the tape machine and that tape track. If you are on a longer delay, you go to another tape track and another tape track. Sometimes you can have two or three. You can set the delay, and if you use a separate tape machine with a pitch, you can do whatever you want with the delay… then you can bring it back to the board and feed it back into itself with the auxiliary again and make whatever kind of freaked-out sounds you want. So, that’s all tape delay and reverb. I do a lot of that in the studio, too, weird stuff with a tape machine. It’s kinda fun. We’ve gotten some weird strange psychedelic sounds and stuff. Mark is talking about the weird synthesizers and stuff, I want to show you another song. This is an instrumental that didn’t make the new Sharon record. We recorded 20-something songs and put about ten of them on there. It is kind of a weird chase kind of thing, but if I can find my way to the middle, there is a cool tape effect. (music: The Dap-Kings – “Thunderclap”) Gabriel Roth That weird “Booo.” It’s just a vibraphone, but when you record it, you get the pitch and you start it slow and you speed it up. So, anyway, it is a lot of fun, those tape-machine tricks and stuff. There is another one, is it interesting? I’ll play one more weird tape machine thing and then we will leave it alone. I dig it, man. You guys are stuck. [Laughter] I was listening to these whole Sly Stone records, these Sly Stone psychedelic records where he has two drum sets. I thought it was two drum sets and I listened closely one day and I thought, “Man, that second drummer is just a little bit off the beat, what is he playing?” And, all of a sudden, it dawned on me, it wasn’t two drummers, it was a delay. So I did the same thing on this one track, I thought it was freaky. Homer was playing the drums, and I put him on one side and I put on an eighth-note delay on the other side. (music: Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings – “Money” / applause) Gabriel Roth I don’t know. I thought it was freaky. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I have also been meaning to ask you, so in addition to you guys doing your thing at Daptone, some of your colleagues do a label called Truth & Soul as well, and I wonder if you can speak a little bit about the whole scene in New York, and everybody doing stuff that has some kindred spirit to it. Gabriel Roth It is definitely like a family affair. Basically, Philippe Lehman and I had Desco Records, and we kind of parted ways in 2000. We started our own labels, I started Daptone with Neal Sugarman and he started Soul Fire with Leon Michels, or El Michels, who was actually playing saxophone in the Dap-Kings at the time. He started working with him a lot, doing arrangements, and Homer also is playing over there a lot. Then he left, he went to the Dominican Republic to be a full-time cave diver – it’s true – so Leon kind of took over, him and Jeff Silverman. They got a label Truth & Soul, and it’s cool, it’s definitely a family thing. It’s not competitive. And now Tommy has got Dunham Records, too, which is an imprint on Daptone. Everybody is working on that stuff, so it is a family of like-minded people out there that came out of the same school. A lot of it came out of those early Desco years, when nobody cared about anything. We were just wild. So, there is a lot of people making cool music and, like I mentioned before, the whole Antibalas crowd and all those guys… And there is a lot of Afro beat music and soul music and people influenced by… people who want to make real music with real musicians. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I remember seeing a YouTube clip of you and Philippe after a Sharon Jones show, I think here in Portsmouth or something like that, and you guys just lamenting how everyone was so into it out here, but nobody cared back home. Gabriel Roth Man, it was kind of strange, because in 1999 or so, when we came here we were selling out shows and it was strange because it was kind of the deep funk scene here. It’s always strange coming from America to England and understanding genres. I had no idea what anybody was talking about, they are like, that’s northern and this is sweet and that’s modern soul. I just thought northern soul was like Detroit and Philadelphia, as opposed to Memphis. I had no idea what everybody was talking about, but there was a lot of people coming to our shows so we were really happy. It was strange, because everywhere else in the world we very slowly built up, and now, almost everywhere we go we can get a lot of people coming to see us. We are selling a lot of records. But England kind of stayed almost the same, relatively – we have not grown that much in England, which is kind of surprising for us, because at the beginning it was kind of our best market. And I wouldn’t say it’s our worst market, but we are always surprised the records aren’t doing better. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Everybody here is doing their thing, and a lot of folks obviously can’t devote full-time attention to the music. They might do as much as they can, but they might have day jobs. Can you talk a little bit about time management? I know you have a young family like myself, and we were talking about this in terms of time management and what you can do and how it affects your creativity. Gabriel Roth You have things together more than me, maybe you should talk about it. Jeff “Chairman” Mao No, you’re the guy. Gabriel Roth It’s pretty hard, it’s the hardest thing I do, trying to balance time with my family and work. And it’s the same thing. Earlier, I didn’t have to balance family, because I didn’t have family, but I had to balance making money and paying rent. Especially, in New York it is pretty hardcore with doing stuff that you like doing. That’s hard. I wish I had better advice to people. I didn’t do it the right way, I just didn’t sleep and ran up all my credit cards. And I’m sure that’s not the way you’re supposed to do it. Really, my whole career was in a way sponsored by Visa and MasterCard. [Laughter] I should really thank them in a way. At one point, by the time Desco was folding I was maybe $40,000 deep in debt, personal debt and credit debt. Not good debt, not business loans. I had nothing to show for it, and I was sleeping at the time on my sister’s couch. I made her a deal – she told me if I could afford to buy her a couch, I could sleep on it. She thought I would be there for like a week, and I was there for a year. I was sleeping on couches and during the day I was working crappy temp jobs. The temp agencies in New York, I would just do that and they would send me down to Wall Street and they would say, “Do you know how to use Excel and PowerPoint?” And I would say, “Yeah, sure, send me in there,” because nobody trusts the temp with anything anyway. That’s good advice – if you want to temp, you are definitely qualified. The worst part was, right when I was in my darkest hour, I was completely broke and everything was going to crap and my label had fallen apart, and I was temping and I hated it. I was trying to do music at night and I wasn’t sleeping. Everything was terrible. The temp agency, out of all the places, they sent me to Sony distribution to be a temp. All the other assignments before then had all been on Wall Street, it had always been money-management stuff. They sent me to Sony distribution, and it was just kind of like the most ironic, terrible, hellish place you could be. Coming out of basically an independent label, I was trying to do everything myself and do it my way, and everything crashed down on me, and it kind of failed. I was sitting inside Sony distribution, and they were trying to tell me, “Here is what you’ve got to do today. You have got to work on this spreadsheet to figure out how many crappy records we can shit out there.” They were just terrible, terrible records, and the worst part was the people there, the people at Sony distribution, didn’t like the records. They would have these meetings and sit around at these meetings talking for an hour or two about the new video for – I won’t say the name of any bands because I don’t want to get anybody in shit – but they would talk about this new band. “Here is their new video. What are we going to do? How about the video budget? Let’s put $1 million into this and $1 million into that. OK, we are going to ship out 300,000 or 900,000.” And this is before anybody heard the record. They’re talking about shipping out this many records; this is how it was working. This is in the beginning of the decade or the last decade, I don’t know, maybe around 2000. It was terrible. And then the meeting would break out and everybody gets into circles and talks about how terrible the record was and none of them liked it. It was really sad. Anyway, just being that deep in the belly of the beast gave me an even darker perspective on it. I’ve always been a kind of bitter dick in that way, but being that deep in it just made me… I was sickened by the whole thing. I definitely came out swinging, and I was not going to jump through any hoops at any marketing meetings or stuff like that. I’ve definitely tempered my attitude a little bit as we have gone forward. The hard part now is that I have a legitimate business and we have a record label and a band that is grossing serious money, and I have a lot of people making a living off it. We have full-time employees, we have a band full of people, people with kids who are depending on it to make a living. So, when somebody comes to me with some marketing idea or some TV commercial or something, unfortunately, that’s where I do feel a little bit trapped. I don’t have the freedom to say to Chase Bank, “Go fuck yourself, man. We’re not doing your commercial, I don’t like your bank.” Now, I have to say, well, if we do that commercial, I’m going to feed somebody’s little kids. So, that’s hard. Even though it is a different struggle now, it is very similar to when you are getting started and you’re trying to balance a day job and the music. There are always compromises. Compromise isn’t necessarily a bad thing. There are definitely bad ones. I made a couple. The other side of that, the Chase commercials, I’m going to bring that up again, I actually learned a lot. I have been hired a number of times to do replays. I’ve done replays for rappers, done replays for commercials, I’ve done replays for movies. Jeff “Chairman” Mao As a hired gun? Gabriel Roth As a producer. I have done them as a musician. People come to me and say, “We want to put this song in a movie,” but you guys probably know that to license a song for a sync or to put it on TV, there are two sides. There is the publishing side and the master side, and you have got to go to the writer for the publishing side, and you got to go to whoever owns the master for the master side. If you have a Stevie Wonder song, you have to get the publishing from Stevie Wonder, and you have to get the master from Motown, who is owned by whoever, who’s owned by Coca-Cola or something. So, what people do is replays, because for the 30-second Chase commercial nobody is going to know the original. There are some bad ones, I don’t know if it happens here as much as in the States, but in movies and TV shows, they do it. Also rappers, sometimes somebody won’t clear the sample, so instead of paying all the money, they try to recreate it. So, we got hired to do a bunch of those. I could play for you guys if you want to hear some of those. The thing I really, really liked about it was that it was like going to school for me. As a band, I always thought we should do covers. In the old days, bands always did covers of whatever the hit was on the radio. “Tighten Up” is on the radio and every band in the nation was playing it. It’s a different thing now. All of a sudden, in the ’70s, every artist had to be a songwriter and everybody had to do their own songs, and it became real cheesy to do covers. It was like, you’re a bar band or something if you do covers. But the thing about doing it is that you learn a lot from doing it, especially in the studio, trying to recreate the sounds. We had to do Motown songs and blues songs and we did a Fela song and a Gladys Knight song recently for Ice Cube or Dr Dre or somebody, but he didn’t use it. I don’t know, weird things. But you end up doing these songs and you’re listening to it in a different way in the studio. You’re saying, “Wow, listen to how much reverb is on the strings,” or, “Listen to how quiet the drums are,” or, “Listen to how bright the guitar is.” You listen to it differently when you’re in the studio, and you realize some record you always loved is not put together the way you thought it was put together. It’s put together real differently. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Can you just give a quick example of something. Gabriel Roth I’ll give you guys a couple. Here is one we did for Chase Bank. I’ll play this if I can figure it out. Is it playing? There you go. (music: The Dap-Kings – “Uptight”) Gabriel Roth Speaking about making replays for Hank Shocklee. Anyway, so we did a bunch of them for him. It was hard because he came and, ahead of time he was like, “OK, I want you guys to do four songs for me.” I thought we could probably do that in a day and then it was like, “OK, I want this one to soundlike Chess Records in 1950. This one’s Nigeria in ’73…” I’m like, “Jesus!” It’s not like we could just leave the stuff set up. Everything was just completely different sounds and different ways to get them and stuff. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Before we get to questions, I want to ask one last thing of you. You said that you had always wanted to be a math teacher. And it’s a legitimate question. I have read of you speaking and you’re very humble about your own musicianship, and you had to think of things in terms of mathematics, in order to be actually able to play how you wanted to play. Will you elaborate on that? Because we have musicians here but we have people who are also doing it themselves and I wonder if you can sort of elaborate on that? Gabriel Roth I can definitely elaborate on that. I know some gifted musicians and some people just seem to sort of channel music from the sky, and it just pours out of their heart and there is just melody and passion pouring out of them. That is not me, man. [Laughter] I do not have that going on. One thing Mark said, and people always say it sounds like I’m being humble and getting from being busted in an interview, but it’s true, the biggest resource I have ever had has been a family of amazing musicians. And I think, if I can take credit for anything, it is for the ability to help them get together and get along and get out of their way. As far as math goes, yes, I am definitely mathematic, formulaic, systematic. That’s why I really enjoyed those replays, because I take things apart piece by piece. It’s what I was talking about before, being able to really get outside of something and get far inside of it. Allow yourself to get outside of something and say, “Man, I love that Fela tune or whatever it is, it just feels good, I’m just going to listen to it,” to be able to get that far outside of it is important. But it is also important to get really far inside of it and say, “Why does the hi-hat sound like that?” Be willing to turn knobs all the way the wrong direction from the way you were taught that they should never be turned, and find those sounds and hear those sounds and put them together. And it has to do with arranging and engineering and everything. It’s like with Sharon Jones, one of the reasons why her and I work together real well, and we’ve been working together for many years, is because she is completely the opposite. We have this kind of Apollonian/Dionysian balance, where she is just crazy, passionate, singing from her gut, won’t do what you tell her, won’t do it the same way twice, won’t do two takes twice. And when you see her live, if she has a bad night, she’ll sit there brooding and she’ll hardly sing, and when she has a good night, she will sing her heart out and blow the roof off the place and people are going to leave there sweating and crying and bleeding. Because she is that crazy and passionate, we make a good team, because I am the opposite. I sit there in the cut playing the bass and I’ll be thinking in terms of, “OK, if we’re going to hit a change coming up, what are the segues, what are the systematic things I need to do to make this change happen? Who in the band needs to know what? What is going wrong? Who was out of tune, who was out of time? Who should play more, who should play less, who should be turned up, who should be turned down?”, all these types of details… I think, in that way, having a mathematical, analytical mind has helped me. But it has only worked because I surround myself with people who are incredible musicians and passionate people and soulful people. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Has anybody got any questions for Gabe? Audience member So, my question is, if you feel like you know a bunch of artists and music, or maybe even your own music that you think should be out there in an independent way, what it is the first step? Gabriel Roth The first step is the hardest step. I definitely don’t have any magic formula to it and I also have not had any huge commercial success, like a lot of people have, who are probably speaking to you guys. But for me, personally, what has worked really well is focusing on the music and having a direct relationship with the people. It is more important to go to a bar and play for seven people and blow their minds and have them have an incredible experience than to do some mediocre shit for 10,000 people. In the long run, it is those seven people and their friends. That is the connection that is important. For us, when we were on the road, people said, “How did you get so many people to come to your shows?” I wasn’t concentrating on promoting the shows, I was concentrating on doing a better show. “What can we do tonight that will be better than last night? What can we do on stage that would be the best thing?” When you talk about getting artists out there, talent is the first step. The first step is finding that sound, and I think, as far as what I did – and it may be different to some of you – it’s really defining success and defining your goals in a realistic and concrete way, so that you can do them day by day. If you come into this and say, “I want to be the biggest producer, I want to have a huge pop record,” you are going to be like a million other people who miss. But if you come into it saying, “You know what? I want to sell 1,000 records and pay my rent,” or, “I want to be able to go on tour and play shows every night and make a living doing that,” then you have a more modest, realistic goal. Those are the stepping stones to a real career in music. Those are the stepping stones to really build a foundation. Get people around you that you have faith in what they do and you like what they do, and work with them. I think it is more about baby steps, as far as I’m concerned. People send me demos and it is unbelievable. I get them in the mail from people who are doing country music or hip-hop stuff that I have nothing to do with. If they had spent five minutes look on the internet, they would know that’s not what I do, and they wouldn’t send it to me. But they send me these unbelievable press kits, much nicer than I have ever sent out, with photos and DVDs and CDs and it must cost them at least $5, $7 to make that. If they sent it to me, they must be sending them to everybody. So, you figure for these guys, this is somebody that’s independent and looking to start a career, and they just spent $5,000 or something sending promos to people. Don’t do that! If you have $5,000, keep it and pay your rent. Buy yourself a guitar or something. One of the biggest problems with the music industry is that there are a lot of people with stars in their eyes, and then there is a whole industry of people that take advantage of that. The reason why record deals are so shitty is not because musicians are stupid, it’s because they all think they’re about to be Michael Jackson. If you’re shooting that high, and you’re looking for that kind of success, that kind of celebrity, that kind of fame and fortune, it’s like playing the lottery. You’re better off, instead of putting all of your money into the lottery, or if you are going to take a gamble, then play blackjack or something you get some odds on. Do something that’s a little more realistic. I’m not saying don’t take risks or don’t spend money, but try thinking in the short term, step by step. Trying to connect people with music is the most important thing, and those are the things that are going to grow in a big way. Maybe some major-label guy with a bunch of money will come and like what you’re doing and be impressed, and maybe they won’t. But I think chasing that stuff is the biggest mistake that people make when they get started. Really chasing after big deals and things like that, either you don’t get them, or you get them and you get kind of screwed because you are so anxious to sign something. Audience member I just want to know how you met Lee Fields and Sharon Jones, and how you built a relationship through the years, because it has been quite a long relationship. Gabriel Roth It has been a great relationship. Lee Fields, by the way, if anybody doesn’t know who he is, I think he is the greatest singer who ever lived, an unbelievable singer. Anyway, the way I met Lee Fields was, Philippe Lehman we were talking about, my crazy partner who would do anything, called him. We were in the studio and we recorded this track and thought it was an amazing track and we should have a singer for it. Philippe said, “Man, we should get Lee Fields to sing this.” I said, “You’re crazy,” because Lee Fields did all these funk 45s in the ’70s and stuff, and I thought he’s an unbelievable singer. But it didn’t even occur to me that people like that still existed. Philippe said, “Yeah, I’ll look.” And this is before the internet, I’m dating myself. But he just called up BMI or some publishing rights organization and said, “Do you have Lee Fields’ number?” And they said yes. He called him and he was in Plainsfield, New Jersey. Two days later, we are in the studio with him. I was 19-years old or something, and I just had no idea what was going on. It was wild. And then a saxophone player on that same session who I used to work with a lot, I wanted to put background singers on this track from Lee Fields and he said, “My girlfriend can come down and sing backup.” I said, “OK, but we need two more girls,” and he said, “OK, I’ll bring two other girls.” He shows up the next day with Sharon Jones and there are no other girls. I said, “Man, I thought you were bringing two others?” And she said, “I’ll do all three parts, I’ll save you money. Why pay them when you can pay me?” And right from the beginning she was crazy, she is nuts, and she did the background vocals. Then we had this other track and we had this comedian friend of Philippe’s, who wanted to do this whole big weird kind of talk-rap spoken word thing about how he got out of prison and stuff. Sharon sang the backing vocal on it, it is called “Switchblade,” and she was singing this real nice chorus in the background and we said, “OK, this is what we’re going to do for the lead,” and she just started talking shit off the top of her head and I hit record. It was the funniest thing ever, and that was the first song I recorded with her, and it was basically her talking shit all about, “I got a switchblade and I’m going to cut ya, and I’m going to split ya where the good Lord slit ya.” It just went on and on and on and we were dying in the control room, and after that we have been working together ever since. Audience member One of the things you mentioned is that you went through a rough patch somewhere after your first label folded. What made you bounce back and why did you decide to do the same thing again? Gabriel Roth It was hard. Again, even after the first time, like I said, I didn’t intend to be in the record industry and, all of a sudden, I had a record label and that kind of fell apart. Not because the business fell apart, the business was doing well. But I had problems with Philippe, and we couldn’t work together any more and it ended up dissolving. The reason I kept going is because at that point we had some momentum musically. The band at the time was the Soul Providers, backing up Lee Fields and Sharon Jones and stuff. We wanted to keep going. We got an offer to do a residency in Barcelona with Sharon, and I wanted to go, so I said, “Let’s record a record so we can go.” I recorded a record in a friends basement and that is our first album with Sharon, it’s called Dap Dippin’. We recorded it in a friend’s basement real quick, and we didn’t really give a lot of thought to it. I just came up with the name of the label, “How about Daptone?” because we were the Dap-Kings and we made a fake label and whatever. Then I talked to another company, and this other company was interested and they wanted to do an imprint deal with me and they said, “You can make whatever records you want.” I said, “Great, I don’t want to deal with the business side of it. You put the records out.” We worked it out and haggled, and at the end of it I had all these terms that I wanted and they were going to give me 40 grand or something like that to make a bunch of records and stuff. I said OK, we shook hands on it, the lawyers all signed off on the deal, I signed the deal, and they said, “The check is in the mail,” and I said “OK,” and I am waiting and I just kept waiting. And I eventually said, “I’m just going to borrow some more money to make some records because the check is in the mail, right?” You guys know about this industry… Anyway, long story short, the check wasn’t in the mail, the company went bankrupt. It was one of about five major blows that I have had in the music industry, where I had something going with a bigger company and there was some check that either didn’t show up or somebody ripped me off. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You guys got robbed, too, right? Your studio got robbed? Gabriel Roth The studio got robbed last year. That wasn’t so bad. Audience member He asked my exact question, so I quickly thought of a new one for you. With new artists, especially when you go and meet more successful people or people that might give you work, there is always the feeling that if you say no to Clive Davis, or whoever it is, you are never going to recover from that and you get the reputation of being difficult, and you are not going to work in this town again. First, is that even remotely true? And second, how do you kind of balance doing what you want to do and what you believe in and what you just have to do because you have to make adjustments when working with other people? Gabriel Roth There is always adjustments. I have had to work with somebody else, when somebody comes in to the studio… I’ll tell you a weird one I did. There’s a singer called Michael Bublé, I did a couple songs on his record and the producer was Bob Rock, who produced Metallica. So this is about the weirdest phone call I could get. For months my manager kept saying, “They want to talk to you about the Bublé record.” I was like, “Are you kidding me? This is a joke, it has nothing to do with me.” Finally, he hands him to me and I talk to Bob Rock on the phone and then it was kind of what you are talking about. I didn’t want to be difficult, but I was very upfront with him and told him exactly what I do and how I do it. I told him three or four times… I said, “You gotta understand, if you want to make a record with me we are live to tape machine, the drummer doesn’t have perfect tempo, and there is not going to be a click track, it is going to be raw.” And he said, “That’s what I want.” I said, “OK, if that’s what you want, then come on down.” When I am working with someone like that I’m very happy to give them what they want, if it’s within the realm of what I am doing. The reason for that is that almost all the records I make, I make them exactly how I want to make them and I don’t have to answer to anybody. So when I have somebody come in there like that, it is really easy to me. It is actually enjoyable for me to step out of the driver’s seat and say, “OK, what do you want? Do you want it to sound more like this or like that? I can do that.” Working with Mark Ronson, I really like working with him and it is easy to work with him because he knows what he wants and he knows what we do. We come to the studio, like the Amy Winehouse record, he played demos of her playing acoustic guitar and singing the song, and we put an arrangement together and he would have some ideas together, and be like, “OK, why don’t we do it in this way or that way?” And I understood the references and he was talking about, Phil Spector, or whatever. It was fun doing it that way. I guess, like I said, the unique position I have been in is that I have never relied on people like that to make my career because I never wanted to be a record mogul or a record producer. And not having that aspiration gave me an unbelievable sense of freedom. If I wanted to be a major record producer, and that was all I wanted to do as a little kid, then when Clive Davis said anything I would have jumped at whatever he wanted me to do, or anyone else for that matter. I think it would have put me at a disadvantage. And the reason why, personally, I have been successful is because I have been concentrating on what I like, and if someone likes what I like, they come to me. Not the other way around. I don’t really have to please outside producers and outside artists in that way. I’m having a meeting in a couple of days with a producer here who is working with some young English singer, and they want to do this gospel record and they want it to sound like this Aretha Franklin kind of Muscle Shoals, Atlantic Records sound. I had the same thing, had a conversation with them and said, “Are you sure this is what you want?” If you come to me and say you’re trying to make a pop record or something, I’m just going to tell you I don’t know how to do it. I realize that might not answer your question, but the point is, I guess, what is it you are trying to do? If you’re trying to work within the industry then, yes, you are going to have to kiss some ass, and you are going to have to make some more compromises and you might have to change the shape of yourself a little bit to fit inside certain places. If you work for yourself and you’re outside the industry, you may not have to do that. Audience member I have a little technical question. Could you walk us through a drum recording session? Gabriel Roth Yes. The first thing I’m going to tell you is the most important and is the one that nobody is going to pay attention to. You need a great drummer. Not a good drummer, a great drummer. And when I say a great drummer, I don’t mean somebody that has chops and has a good sense of time. I mean somebody that, when they hit the drum there is a tone that makes you feel good. A thump when they hit the snare drum. Certain drummers get work because they have a tone on the drum set, they have a feel, and if you have a good feel and a good tone that is 90% of it. So, that is the first thing. The second thing is the drum set. You want the drum set to sound good. So, you stand in the room and you tune the snare drum, and you take a pillow out of the bass drum and then put it back in and tape up the tom and you put it in the other room, then try it a different way, all the stuff you normally do with a drum sounds. Experiment. You try anything until it sounds good. And it has to sound good in the room before you get a microphone. And the other thing, with a microphone, it depends on what kind of microphone use, but for the most part, microphones on a drum set is all about placement. There is no secret placement. When Ronson was in and we were doing the Amy Winehouse record, I had this old Shure 556, it’s an old Shure mic like an Elvis mic, and I had this one I used to love. It got stolen in the robbery. But I had this one I used to love, and when I say this one, I mean this one mic because I bought four of five other ones at different times and none of the other ones sounded good. People will tell you this is a good mic and this is a bad mic but they all sound different. There is no such thing as a brand sounding a certain way. I had that mic and I put it on the ground maybe a foot or two up between the bass drum and the snare drum, pointing kind of up underneath the snare, and I got a great sound that way. I think I ran it through a compressor and I did a lot of heavy EQing. In the room where I record drums, I tend to have to roll out a lot of low-mid frequencies. I almost always use one mic. Once in a while, I’ll use two mics if something has a lot of tom-tom or cymbal. And maybe I have a mic in one position that sounds great but I’m not hearing one thing and maybe you’ll add a second mic. But 90% of the time I use one microphone. Nowadays, as you guys know, a lot of people use 10, 15 mics on a drum set. The top of the hi-hat, the bottom of the hi- hat, the stool. They might have everything in the room, overheads and underheads, and at the end they try and mix it together to sound like a drum set. My take on that is to try and let the drummer sound like a drum set and just record it. I find, though, that, if I move a microphone one inch up or down or to the left or to the right, it sounds completely different. If I’m not getting enough bass drum, I can move the microphone down an inch and I’ll get a lot more bass drum. If I’m getting too much rack tom, maybe I can move it further, sometimes I move it closer. It sounds strange, but sometimes if you are closer to something that has a lot of low-end resonance, you will lose it just because of the phase of the resonance. Another thing I often do with drums, the high frequencies, 12 to 15k, I just cut it off. I go through a low-pass filter and just take it out, and I’ll find something just underneath there at 8 or 10k and push it really hard. Since that is where you get all that open, perfect, Phil Collins drum sound at the top of the cymbals, which is something that you hear when you like the drums. When you think about it, these songs on the radio we hear that use samples, the drums they sample are always the weirdest, rawest drum sound. They are all one mic on the drums. Nobody is sampling drum sounds with a bunch of mics. So, the kind of music that I like, raw soulful music, always has that kind of drum sound. We get some different sounds, but for the most part one mic and a lot of EQing on the tape. The other thing is hitting the tape real hard. Here is another trick for those of you recording drums to tape machines. Tape distortion is really different on different frequencies. Low frequencies, like a bass guitar or a kick drum, distort tape in this real fuzzy way and they do it real soon, because it’s a higher-energy wave. High frequencies get a nice crunchiness that, but if you have a mic on the drums and you try and hit the tape machine with it, you will find that the lower end will distort the tape. The kick drum will distort the tape before you get anything nice, before you get that nice compression and before your cymbals and your hi-hat and snare drum get that crunchy tight compression that sounds nice off the tape. So what I do is I roll the bass out going to tape, not all of it. But I will get 100 Hz or something, and dip it way down so the sound I record is pretty thin. I hit the tape harder and harder until the bottom end swells back up and the top end is crunchy and it all kind of re-equalises. And if it doesn’t on the playback, I turn it back up. Whenever I am recording, especially drum sounds, but most sounds, I’m listening to the actual playback of the tape machine, which is delayed and I’m really careful about how hard I am hitting the tape. I don’t really have any more good drum tips. A good drummer is the best one. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Alright, this concludes the talk. Please join me in thanking Gabriel Roth. [applause]

Title: Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short

Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short
With the kind of reputation that strikes fear in the heart of anyone entering a “name the rare breaks” battle, Gerald “Jazzman” Short has been running his online store and reissue label, Jazzman Records, for over a decade. Specializing in obscure US music from the ’60s onwards, he has researched and tracked down many slept-on tracks and the musicians that made them.
The crate-digging addict speaks with Benji B at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy about the process of uncovering forgotten gems.
Hosted by BENJI B [applause] So Gerald, for those people not familiar with what you do for a living, could you introduce yourself and tell us what you do? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah. It’s hard to make a living in music so I do three different things basically. One is DJing, second is running Jazzman Records record label, and third one is selling old records mostly via my website. Benji B Now, that’s a very modest way of putting it because Gerald’s known amongst crate-diggers the world over as a pretty well-known record dealer. And how long have you been doing that for? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Second-hand records about 15 years now or something. Since the early ‘90s for sure. Benji B And that really is a culture in itself, but from how you got into it, did you come at it from just a music fan perspective or was it a business decision? How did you find yourself being a record pimp for people, basically? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short In those days, it was hard to get records in London, which is where I’m based, and the only way you could do it really, properly, was by paying a lot of money to a lot of the record dealers and getting ripped off in the process. Or you could go to America and buy the record yourself. So basically, that’s what I ended up doing, I just went to America. I saved up some cash, went out there, and that was in the days when you could actually find a lot of records in quantity for pretty cheap. So that’s what I did. I just went out there because I really liked music and I just felt the compulsion to go out there and just do it myself and find the records. And once you find some, you see another one that’s worth some money. You might want to buy that so you can sell it and use the money to go and buy more records, it just multiplies like that. Benji B And when you say the music, what type of music are we talking about? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short This is mostly jazz music or funk music, or funky jazz, or Latin or fusion. Basically black American music from the ‘60s and early ‘70s. Benji B And when you’re talking about records that you can find for cheap that are worth I mean, who decides what a record is worth? Is it you? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short That’s a good question. I suppose, in those days some of the prices were set by record dealers. They had an idea of what they were worth and there were lists because some record dealers had been doing it for quite a while, so there’s a general understanding of what certain records are worth. If you found one that had never really been listed, or people didn’t really know about, you could sort of… well, you’d listen to it and use your own ears, basically, and get an idea of how rare it was, match it up against how good the record was. If it was really rare, and it was really good, then you’d put quite a high price on it because the demand would increase. It’s literally just supply and demand. It’s a s simple as that. The demand is much higher for the good records, and if the supply is low, it means the price is high and vice versa as well. No one really wants rubbish records and no one really wants common ones because they can buy them anyway so the price is quite low. So it literally is a classic supply and demand situation. Benji B Now, a lot of people, and producers especially, buy records from you for breaks and stuff, but that’s not really the reason you got into the music, right? You’re more about the actual content of the record itself? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I was just purely into the music like anyone else. I just wanted to get records because I just love the music and once you’ve heard one you want to hear another one. You hear another one and you want to find out about more and you just want to get more and more records and hear more and more music, because you’re just into it so much. I wasn’t the only one, a lot of people were in that and they’re the people I ended up selling to and I did that so much that eventually I could make a living out if it. Benji B To people that aren’t necessarily from that culture or from that generation, it can seem like a bit of an elitist culture, this thing of selling records for 250 quid or 500 dollars or whatever, and always trying to hide the label and finding the thing that the next man’s got. To what extent is it an elitist culture or is it something that anyone can get into? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short It can be elitist, yeah, and sometimes it’s a good thing, sometimes it’s a bad thing. It’s good in the ways that if a certain pedigree or high value is put on a rare record, it means that people are going to value it more and therefore they’re going to go out and look for it and they’re going to make new discoveries. And they’ve got an incentive to go out and try and find new things or rare things or expensive things because they can get the money for it basically, which means that new discoveries are going to be made. But on the other hand it can be bad that people buy the records, or the expensive records, for the wrong reasons. They do it to massage their own egos or to feel good about it or show off to their friends, which isn’t necessarily a good thing. But the best thing about the fact that it could be rare or expensive is that people will take the effort to go out and find the things. Otherwise, half the records that are reissued that a lot of people really enjoy would never have been discovered. Benji B So let’s talk about that, the other facet to your business. What you do mainly now is a record label. How long have you been running that and what’s it called? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Jazzman Records. The label started in ‘98. So eight years now. We started off with a 7” single. I didn’t bring one here but we put it out on one of the CDs. Kathleen Emery, maybe we can play it now if you want? Benji B Yeah, let’s play that. This is certainly the first record that you put out but I remember when this came out. How did you come across this record and why did you decide to re-issue it on a 7”? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short It was a record dealer in Boston, he’s sold everything now, his name’s Boston Bob, and I used to do a lot of trade with him and he first played it to me for the b-side which is a version of “Evil Ways,” a Santana song, and I liked the a-side a bit better and it turned out that when I brought it back, no one had ever heard of it in London. I DJed it in Munich and I remember it had a really good response, even though it’s a bit of a quirky one as you’ll hear, and I thought, “If I’m the only person who’s got this record and a lot of people really like it, then it makes sense to reissue it in such a way that everyone else who likes it will be able to hear it instead of just me in my bedroom.” So that’s why we put it out on single. And I put it out on 7” single because, one – that was the format it originally came out on and secondly, because I thought if no one wants to buy it I’m not going to lose too much money because sevens are pretty cheap to make compared to CDs and albums or 12"s or whatever. (music: Kathleen Emery — “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child”) Benji B So that’s Kathleen Emery “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,” right? And also you decided to do CDs as well? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I didn’t do any CDs to start off with, but once I’d done ten or so 7” singles, it just made sense to put some on CD because not everyone’s got a record player, simple as that. And also it makes business sense because you can sell the same records all over again and I have to stay in the business. Although I’m not a CD person, I’m much more a vinyl person, it does make sense to spread the music using whatever medium it takes. Benji B One thing that strikes me about the way you do your stuff is completely in respect to the artist. I mean, there’s amazing sleeve notes in all of the stuff that you do and I remember you saying it takes three years to put together one of these comps. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short The funk ones take, yeah, the last one took three years to do. The one before that did. Well, the reason behind that is a lot of research is original. We don’t look on the internet to get the information that we put about the artist on there, we have to meet each artist individually and interview them to get the information, and that takes a long time. Not just to find them but to go to America to meet them and do the interview, too. We see that as being really important because it’s the type of music that we’re putting out, it’d otherwise be forgotten about because a lot of it is so obscure and so rare that people otherwise would never know about it, so we take a lot of time and effort. One, to find out about it in the first place; two, to actually go and reissue the stuff properly because otherwise it would just never get known about it’d just get forgotten about completely and the only people that would know about it would be the collectors and the DJs. But we see the music that we’re doing as being of proper historical significance for the history of music in the States, not just in the States but the whole world, especially the funk stuff we’re doing because that’s the basis of a lot of modern music. It’s not just James Brown or Stevie Wonder or Aretha Franklin, there’s a lot of local artists that never got it big and we see it as being very important that they get some of the limelight that they deserve, that they never got in the first place. And that’s one of the main reasons why we do it. If you go to a record store and you get a CD on rockabilly or doo wop or reggae, you can get thousands of them and all the liner notes, it’s all been documented and you can read all about it. But the funk stuff was very, very little [documented until] a few years ago. If you bought a funk CD it’d just have Earth, Wind & Fire on it or Stevie Wonder or something, which is all very well but there’s a hell of a lot more to it than that and that’s what we’re trying to show by putting out the CDs that we do. Benji B The business side of it’s important as well because there’s a lot of comps out there putting out rare stuff and funk and soul, and it’s all from the perspective of wanting to share it with people, but I know that sometimes not everyone’s business is straight and sometimes it’s very hard to track down the original artist, especially in the case of people that have only cut one 45 or a couple of singles or whatever. And that’s quite important to you isn’t it, to make sure all of that is good? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short It is hard. It took us five years to find one guy called Arthur Monday, for instance. He made a couple of records released on a small Californian label, we tracked him down to a nursing home in Louisiana. I don’t do a lot of the tracking down, I’ve got to give credit to Malcolm Catto who does most of the work. It means staying up until the early hours of the morning and ringing 50 people with the same name in the phone book and finding out that even though you spoke to 50 people, none of them happen to be that person. It really is painstaking work, but he does do it. But it’s worth it in the end because when you actually do come across that guy and you go and meet him and you do the interview, it’s really good to meet someone who appreciates the fact that you spent all that time and effort to find them and they made a record, say, 30 years ago that they never ever thought would see the light of day again and you’re telling them that they’re going to get paid for it. Sometimes they think that they have to pay you to get it put on a CD but you say, “No, we pay you to put it on CD,” and they get royalties from it. And they actually get recognition for the first time in all that time because even at the time, when they released it, it may never have got a proper release, they might have got ripped off or whatever. So it’s very satisfying and fulfilling to meet these old guys, even if it takes a lot of work and effort to go and meet them. Like I say, I see it as an important part of documenting the musical history of the States. If we don’t do it, no one else will and I think there’s Stones Throw in the States and there’s another company, I forget the name, who take the effort to do it. Not many people do. But I suppose you could say there’s a gap in the market as well because we’re the only ones that can be bothered to do it like that. Soul Jazz do it as well to a certain extent. Benji B Have you got any particular good stories or any particular case studies of people that you’ve tracked down? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Well, that Arthur Monday one was pretty good after five years looking for him and being at the nursing home where he was and then he suddenly appeared in his wheelchair, and it was good to see the grin on his face. It was good meeting James Dole from the Highlighters because he did a song called “Funky 16 Corners” and he started doing a dance in his living room. It’s good meeting people like Billy Larkin whose Hammond organ was on the porch and it was all covered in dust and cobwebs and covered in tarpaulin and he ripped that off and started playing on it for us even though it wasn’t plugged in. If I think of one that springs to mind, I’ll let you know in a sec, but basically it’s great meeting those old guys who after having mostly had very little success and someone coming out of the woodwork and traveling from England they’re really pretty chuffed that someone has taken an interest in them again. Especially because the music they make, it’s actually properly good stuff a lot of the funk stuff they did. I mean, a lot of the funk music that was made in them days, a lot of it was pretty bad. A lot of it deserves never to be heard because it’s not really that good. But we just look for the really properly good ones and I think it’s a shame that a lot of them never got the success that they could have had or deserved back when it was first released. And a lot of the guys, they know it was good but for one reason or another the stories of which we put in the CDs, they never actually got the dues they deserved. Benji B Have you got an example of one of those type records we could play? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short We could play this one, Fred Williams. Some people might recognize this because Talib Kweli sampled it recently. Track number seven. (music: Fred Williams — “Tell Her”) Anyone recognize that? [Talib Kweli] used it recently, I can’t remember the song. [inaudible suggestion off camera] That’s the one. Benji B This is from an album called Midwest Funk 45s From Tornado Alley. I mean, all these CDs, there’s so much care and love gone into each one there’s almost a mini essay on each one, it must take you years to do these things. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, that one took us two or three years to do as well. That’s the American issue. Stones Throw released it in the States, but yeah, it takes ages. Like I say, we have to meet each of the artists or producers in their own right to get an interview with them and get the story from them, because there’s no information otherwise, there’s nothing on the internet, there’s nothing at all. We try and do it properly, otherwise the story never gets told. Benji B Now, in here there’s all of the pictures of all of the records, they’re all 45s, they’re all 7” records and people pay a lot of money for albums but the real money that people spend is always 45s, that’s where the real super-expensive buying market is. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short It does tend to be that way actually, yeah. Benji B Why is that? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Probably because if you’re looking at a 7” single, there’s just one song on it and it’s three minutes long. And a lot of these things are independently made, they’re quite rare. They probably only made a few hundred at the time, the band probably only made that one single. So that 7” single that’s rare and expensive probably encapsulates the sole artistic output of that band. It’s just been condensed into that one 7” single. They didn’t do any other singles, they didn’t do an album, they didn’t do anything else, just that one thing. So the concentration of that musical legacy is in that one little three minute song, and because it’s concentrated into that one little thing I think that has a lot to do with the value of the art that’s gone into it. If it’s a whole album or it’s loads and loads of albums, then it’s spread across a lot of output. So it means that I think the value of the artisticness is being spread over more, it’s more diluted. I think that’s why people value 7” singles a lot more, because of the concentration of the output into one specific little thing that’s just three minutes long. It’s a concentrated thing. Benji B What’s the most expensive song you’ve heard of? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Well, northern soul records tend to sell for more money than most things. Then garage records as well. There’s garage records and northern soul records, wouldn’t bat an eyelid spending thousands and thousands of pounds. Benji B Like for one song? For example? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I couldn’t tell you about northern or garage, but I know collectors and stories and look on those high prices on eBay. The funk things they don’t sell for that many, but it’s not uncommon to see a four figure for a seven inch single of funk music, which is the kind of thing I’m dealingwith. Fornorthern there’s a lot less recordsandmore people so the demand is a lot higher. And the supply is low, so it’s assimple as that. Supply and demand. Benji B You might not want to answer this but what’s the most you’ve ever paid for a record? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I’ll pay a lot of money for a record that I really want it, but I can make excuses by saying I want to reissue it or something, so I’m allowed. Benji B What’s the most that anyone’s ever paid you for one record? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I’ve been paid a couple of thousand pounds for a single before, on a couple occasions. Which, you know, it’s, that’s what the guy wanted to pay and that’s pretty much what it’s worth, there’s only one or two known copies in the world. That’s the price. Benji B And after 15 years or 20 years of buying records, do you still have that buzz of when you hear a record that you’ve got to have, that nothing’s going to stand in your way? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, I wouldn’t mind a copy of that Fred Williams you just played. I don’t have a copy of that. Sometimes if a record gets under your skin, it’s inside you, you can’t get it out your head, you just gotta have it. Having the CD isn’t the same, you gotta have the original artifact. It can take months or years to find it. If you’ve missed that opportunity you may never see it again, so you just gotta bite the bullet. There’s one thing about spending all that money on records, some people balk about paying those sort of prices, but if you don’t see it… Anyone can do it. Anyone can find some cheap records, sell them on eBay, put enough money on your PayPal account, do that enough times and eventually you’ve got enough money on your PayPal account to buy the records you want. It’s just a matter of do you want to do the work to find the records, and can you be bothered to do all that buying and selling stuff to get the money. It’s all about, you do need a certain amount of dedication, a certain manpower to do it. But the real trick, like I was saying earlier, is not to spend a lot of money on records. The trick is to find it cheap. There’s nothing clever about spending a thousand pounds on a record. If you can find that record for fifty cents or a dollar, then that’s where the cleverness is. That’s the way to do it. But having said that I must emphasize that, uh, it’s all very well finding a record like that for a dollar, a really rare one, but if we meet the office and they’ve got a rare record. One example for instance is James Bell guy I was talking about, he had this copy of “Funky 16 Corners” and it’s worth a thousand pounds or whatever. We said, “Do you want to sell it?” And he said, “Oh, yeah, you can have it for ten bucks.” And, um, I couldn’t take it for ten dollars because sooner or later he’d find out it was worth a lot of money, and then he’d start hating us, and we’d be taking advantage of him. We couldn’t do anything like that. Some people would but that’s not the idea. We do pay the artists a proper price for the records we get off them so that we’re not taking advantage of them. Benji B What do you say to people who say you might as well be collecting stamps or marbles or something? I mean, to some people that obsessive culture just seems like hoarding. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Well, for a stamp collector, they’ve got their reasons for collecting stamps. Everyone’s got their own reasons for doing stuff. With music I believe that the musicians created the records in the first place and the music in the first place to be able to express themselves, to get people to listen to it and enjoy it and dance to it. For a record collector to buy it and keep it for themselves or for a DJ to cover it up and not tell anyone what it is, I think that’s being disrespectful to the very essence of why the music was made in the first place. So I don’t cover any of my records up. Another reason why I do the reissues is to spread the music because otherwise it would not get the opportunity to be spread in the first place. That’s one reason why, you know, I do do the reissues. If I do anything with it. Everyone’s got their reasons for doing things but I believe in spreading it, that’s one of the main reasons and philosophies behind the label I do. Benji B I must say that 90 percent of the stuff I hear on your reissues I’ve never, ever heard before. Can we play a couple of things just to give an idea of what you do? How long has it been since ’98 and how many 7"s have you put out? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I think we’re just about starting on 53 or 54, what’s that, seven or eight per year or something? We’re trying to do one every month, but it’s not easy. This is a song called New Generation by the Universals, another funk one. (music: The Universals — “New Generation”) Benji B Now a lot of the beatmakers that are sitting in this room hear that record in a very particular way and certain bits of that record spring out. I know a lot of producers over the years always traditionally come see you when they’re in London. What are some of hte people who’ve bought breaks from you? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short They don’t really buy breaks from me anymore, they used to in the ’90s. It’s sort of changed a lot in the last few years. But hip-hop producers, a lot of them buy drums or have in the past rather. PM:Gong. He’s one of those guys who wants every single record that’s got a drum break. Even if it’s really rubbish record. Otherwise he’ll just pay whatever it takes for it. Pete Rock bought some records. Um, 45 King. I haven’t seen a lot of these people for quite a while now, you know. The guy from Public Enemy, I forgot his name, whose record collection burned up. It’s a bit grim, but anyway. Like the guy who was here before said, a lot of people don’t sample records anymore, they make their own beats. Benji B Are you into contemporary music? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I don’t really have much time to get into it. I’m stuck in the past basically. Generally not so much. Like I say, I really am stuck in the old days. I’m much more traditional in the sense that I like a band, I like to feel a big combination of a group of people playing together, musical instruments. Because I’m so busy researching, I just don’t have the time to get into new stuff. But I think my current favorite band is Broadcast, from Birmingham, England. Benji B It’s just interesting because a lot of people into the type of music you were playing come to it from a b-boy angle as well, a breaks angle. But that’s not a big thing for you is it? You’re into the record in its entirety? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, I can understand why people like things for reasons like that, but everyone comes at music from a different angle. Everyone’s got their own agenda. Me personally, it just depends whether you feel it inside or not, whether it gets under your skin. That’s the criteria for a good record to me, whether it’s new or old. Whether it gets inside of you and you can’t get it out of your head then you have to have it. That’s where I’m concerned. Benji B Do you just strictly play old music? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I only play 7"s, mostly because I can’t be bothered to lug LPs and 12s around. I only play old music. There’s some new things, but only if it comes out on 7” single. Mostly because I like to fit it in my box. That’s basically why I get booked, because people want to hear the 7"s, they want to hear the old music that I’ve got. They wouldn’t book me otherwise. Benji B How is the development of technology, MP3, people buying their stuff online, has that affected your business? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Um, I think it may have done, you know. Some of the records we have got, we have got the copyright to be downloadable, there is that element. But I think with most downloadable music they’re looking for modern things. It’s a more recent concept. I think people like the old music in a manner that we’re talking about here, people do like to hear it on an old format, a seven-inch single or an LP or even a CD. you can call that old now, can’t you? I”m doing OK still manufacturing 7"s. A lot of people buy them simply because they are different. Because it is, you know, a change from the norm if you like. People may seem them as novelty things. But I still make enough and sell enough to make it worthwhile, so I must be doing something right and people must still like them,otherwise no one would buy them. Benji B I mean obviously DJs have played a big part in keeping vinyl culture alive and healthy. As even DJing starts to move more in the realm of Serato and computer DJing, will there always be a community of people looking to buy rare records? Will that ever die, or will they become like 78s? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I think they will die, eventually, sooner or later, but there’s so many records out there, you know, there must be billions of the things and they can’t just disappear overnight. There’s literally so many of them, and even if most people do move onto computers or onto more modern forms of music storage, there’s always going to be people who like music regardless of the format. If it means they have to listen to it on a single, then they will. You can’t deny the fact that they’re on the decrease, but that doesn’t mean to say that they’re going to be gone forever. There’s too many for them around for that to happen. Benji B You hear of a lot of people who have hundreds of thousands of records and legendary collections but I know that a lot of serious collectors just have the what and no chaff. How many records do you have at home? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Um, singles, I’ve got about a thousand. Albums, probably three thousand or something like that. That’s enough. If I get more, then I’ll probably get rid of some. You hear of some people who have 30, 40, 50-odd thousand or more. In my head, where do you keep them? How do you know where everything is? I think I’ve got the right sort of size to manage. Benji B So people can do mail order off the Internet for the 7"s right? And the CDs. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, we’ve got distribution as well. They do get sold all over the world. We do have our own website where we sell them about a month before you can get them in the shop, a marketing issue we’ve got which works pretty well because you can get full value for them and you can get them a month before the shops sell it. They can have it before everyone else sort of thing. Yeah, we’ve been doing that since the late ’90s as well. It works out pretty good. Benji B And you’re DJing regularly? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Mostly gigs in Europe, yeah. Mostly clubs in Spain, Germany, France, Italy. Wherever. Not very much in England. Benji B Talk us through a couple of the projects that you did, like the Florida Funk because there’s different themes, isn’t there? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah. What happened was a few years ago DJ Shadow was around and he was playing lots of singles that he’d found in Texas and it suddenly dawned on me that we should maybe do a collection of them. So we did this album called Texas Funk, which is made of funk 45s from the state of Texas. And it wasn’t a great leap of knowledge to realize that we could do that for other states in America as well. So we did the Midwest one, which was the next one on the agenda, and we did the Florida one which isn’t released yet and that’s this one here [holds up CD cover], and these are the ones we saved for quite a long time. It took several years to get the copyrights for them and do the interviews and find the artists and everything. So this Florida one is the latest one and we’re pretty chuffed to be able to put this one out because that’s taken ages to get that together. Some of the other ones we’ve done, this one here is one of the compilations that Quantic endorsed for us, which is the World’s Rarest Funk 45s and this has got a lot of 45s on there which are really rare, where there’s one known copy in the world, or just a handful or something like that, and we put the best of those onto this CD. Like I was saying earlier, a lot of rare funk 45s or whatever 45s for that matter, they can be rubbish. There can be one known copy but if it’s no good, there’s no point in valuing it or putting it onto a CD. So these ones we take the best ones and the rarest at the same time and put them on to the CD and again we find the artist and get the photographs of them and do interviews with them so that the story is told. But that’s just one aspect of the stuff. We don’t just do the funk things, we basically try and represent a lot of that because no one else is doing it, but on the Jazzman label we try and put a variety of music in that label. It’s not just funk singers, we put some jazzy ones, some fusion ones, some disco-type ones, some ‘60s mod ones, some weird things that are pretty much uncategorizable and just put a massive variety of things on that label. So on that label we’ve got some CDs that we’ve done that compile the various a-sides and b-sides of the singles. So we’ve got this one, Soul Freedom, in fact I’ll read the blurb on it. “Madcap live records, breathtaking female songs, spaced-out cosmic jazz, heavy, deep funk and rarest of rare groove.” So it’s got a wide variety of stuff on there but the common denominator with all the singles is that they are all pretty obscure, they are all hard to find but they are all good. They are all worthy of being taken out of obscurity and released for the first time in a proper context in that sense. This is an example, this is some Egyptian music that was recorded in 1972 and this one is the next thing we are putting out. A whole album of this stuff has come out recently and this is a classic example of what I’m talking about where… what the hell is Egyptian jazz music doing? Who even thought that such a thing existed, especially stuff that is pretty listenable and danceable even? Let’s play this. (music: Salah Ragab & the Cairo Jazz Band — “Egypt Strut”) So there’s some Egyptian jazz for you. That was Salah Ragab from Egypt, and like I was saying, if obscure records like that never get reissued, then they’re never going to get heard and I think that musically is valid for a lot of people who are listening to music, not just American stuff but European stuff and stuff from all over the world. Because there’s good music from all over the world, it just takes a bit of time to dig the stuff out. The stuff we do it’s not just oddball stuff like that, we do some straight-ahead stuff too. This thing, “Hercules” by Aaron Neville, is definitely worth putting out on 7" again. (music: Aaron Neville — “Hercules”) I’ll stick something else on. This is another one. That was an example of some soul music, this is some New York Latin from Ricardo Marrero. (music: Ricardo Marrero — “Babalonia”) Latin funk from New York. One thing about that guy Ricardo Marrero, his master tapes were stolen from one of the employees in the studio and the whole thing was released without his knowing. It’s funny little stories like that that I find really interesting and they’re the sort of things we write about in the booklets. Otherwise, if you did hear the record you’d just hear the record, you wouldn’t know anything about the producer, the musician at all, and I think it’s pretty valid to hear the stories of the musician and what they say about the music they made as well rather than purely just the music that they made and not knowing anything about them. So it’s pretty important for us to write about this stuff on the CDs. Benji B When you find the music do they have the masters still or are you mastering off the seven? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short A bit of both. A lot of the time we have to take off vinyl. The tapes that they originally recorded on, they deteriorate or just get lost over the years. Once the records been pressed the tape’s superfluous, a lot of the time they’ve got rid of it or lost it for whatever reason. Bit of a shame, but anyway… Benji B You wanted to play this Letta Mbulu track, which we don’t have on vinyl but it’s off the CD, right? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, but I don’t know how to work that thing, you’ll have to do it for me. Benji B It was bootlegged quite a lot in the ‘90s but then you put it out legitimately towards the end, right? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah. We flipped it with Lorez Alexandria, we try and make a theme of the singles that we put out so that there’s… That particular one has got two female vocals on each side. The Ricardo Marrero one, we had a different version of that song on the other side so you get two songs on each side rather than most b-sides of singles where they just put on a filler track. Pretty popular one this Letta Mbulu, we sold quite a few copies of this. (music: Letta Mbulu — “What’s Wrong With Groovin’”) Benji B Question time. Any questions? Straight away. Have we got a mic? Audience Member Hello. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Hello. Audience Member Actually I also have the disease as you, but for disco records. Original disco records. I used to collect a little bit of funk also and Kapp Dodge is one of the real men who is very special in the area of funk collectors and disco lovers. There is a rumor that he with his biggest collection has started to sell his records because he got fed up with it. He said something like, “it’s time for me to get my living out of these records. I’m tired of it.” I think it would be great because he can sell every record and just go to Miami every week. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short He sold them already. He sold a lot of his records already, because I don’t know, I think he needed the money. He had just certain personal problems so he’s put a lot of his records on a new type of dubplate where it’s etched into plastic rub then lacquer. So a lot of his records he’s already gotten rid of and used the money to put the money to put his records onto these plastic vinyl dubplate things. So he DJs mostly off those now. He doesn’t really buy or spend his money like he used to. [He has a] notorious reputation for having raised the prices of a lot of records by just proclaiming to everyone, “I’ll pay more money than anyone else on rare records.” That’s one reason why he’s got the big collection and the rarities that he did. He was probably responsible for the huge price rise in funk records in the nineties. It’s all Kapp Dodge’s fault. And he’ll admit it. It’s all his fault. Benji B Is there amongst the community of record dealers and record collectors, do you help each other out or is it competitive? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short It used to be competitive. We help each other out now a lot more. There’s one time for instance when Kapp used to cover records up so that no one else would know what they were. So he could be the only person able to DJ it. Like ‘Jazzman’ was saying earlier. Then Malcolm Catto who also had a lot of rare records as well, went down to South and said, “Oh, what are they?” And he kept saying, “I’m not going to tell you.” Then Malcolm said, “Well then I’m not going to tell you what mine are either then.” So when you get two doing that you might as well, so they both took off their covers and revealed to each other what they were. They both win because they can both go out and get those records. The thing is because they are rare you can’t just walk to your local shop and just buy them. You have to hunt them down. It’s self-defeating really, covering things up, because if you do that and everyone else does that you are never going to learn. No one is ever going to make new discoveries. No one is ever going to find out everything. No one is ever going to play any new records. So by aiding people and showing people what you’ve got, it will help you as well. If you show one person your rare record or if you show ten people then ten people will show you, and you end up getting ten new pieces of information if you like. As opposed to none at all. It’s so much more sensible to share the knowledge. It really is and like I was saying before it’s the decent thing if you like. Like they say the artist didn’t make the music in the first place to give to one person so they could keep it a secret. It’s not really very respectful I don’t think. Audience Member With the settings that you are reissuing now what sort of run would you do with those? How many would you sell? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I would start off with a thousand now. A few years ago they were a lot more popular. I was doing two thousand. Now I just do one thousand and if I need to repress I’ve got an option to do that. Audience Member And of what proportion of those would you actually go into repress on? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Every three or four records I’ll put something out that’s blatantly commercial to pay for the ones which every three or four ones aren’t commercial. So, for instance, I deliberately did Marlena Shaw “California Soul” because I knew I would sell lots of copies. On the other hand soon after that I did some folky ones from Canada that I thought no one was going to buy this. I knew that the people that would buy it would be really, really grateful they had done it because they would be really into it. It’s just that they’re in the minority. The minority records are paid for by the majority ones. So I deliberately do some that I know I’m going to sell a lot of to pay for the ones that I know I’m not going to sell a lot of, but nevertheless still deserve to get released. I got the idea of that from Blue Note Records actually. They used to do the same. They would deliberately do something like “Sidewinder” or “Song for My Father” knowing they would sell loads and then use the money from that in order to pay for Ornette Coleman and the free jazz things that they knew wouldn’t sell hardly any, but they nevertheless thought deserved a place in the market. Because they were still valid pieces of music. It’s just that they weren’t going to sell those and those are copies. Audience Member I’ve just got one more as well. When you were going through mastering process, mastering to release it, how much or how often would you go through any kind of restoration sort of process off of the recording? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short If we take it from a tape it’s a lot easier than taking it from vinyl. If we take it from vinyl that can be difficult. Technology is pretty good now. Just program this to get rid of crackle. Program to get rid of hiss. Programs that get rid of pops. You can, if you’ve got a good engineer with a good ear, then you can get rid of all of that noise. A few years ago it was a lot more difficult, but it’s a lot better now. Once you got rid of that you can cue it to make it sound half-decent. There’s one issue of contention and that’s if you’ve got a record that originally sounded really bad because it was mastered badly or mixed badly, the question now is what do I do? Do I make it sound as true to the original as it was, even if it sounded rubbish, or do I try and change it now with the use of modern technology and make it sound how they would have liked it to sound back in those days? That’s an issue that I’m always trying to contend with. I never really get to grips with that. I never get a proper answer for myself. What would you do? Audience Member I don’t know. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Everyone’s got different ideas. I don’t know. You just, there’s no real answer for that, is there? Audience Member Official. Thank you. Audience Member Hi, thank you. I have a couple of questions. I heard a rumor when I first started collecting records just from thrift shops and stuff that if something says it’s an original release, but there is print through at the beginning, do you know what I mean? Does that mean is actually not the original release? It has been reprinted from the tape after it sat for a while. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short How do you mean print through? Audience Member Print through when you hear a tape has been wrapped the wrong way and a little bit of the original audio signal has been pressed onto the beginning of the vinyl. You know how sometimes you hear? Does that mean that that is not the original pressing? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Are you talking about singles or LPs? Audience Member Just anything that is pressed or recorded. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I think that happens just as a matter of the way the tape has been rolled up. Sometimes it doesn’t go through. Audience Member Doesn’t it take time for that to happen? Say something says it’s an original release or is that a second release of something. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Not necessarily because something could have been recorded and not actually mastered or cut until months after it was recorded. The tape could have sat on the shelf. I’ve come across records where it was recorded in ’72, but only released in ’76. That’s four years difference. In four years that may have had that print through time that you are talking about. On the other hand it could just be down to the conditions that the tape was stored in. I don’t think it really, I don’t think you can infer that something has been repressed just because you have that little bit of sound at the beginning on and off. Usually, things, especially singles, were never really repressed and if they did they would be done with a different color label or something or a different matrix number. You can look on the internet or look in various books. There is a Swiss book called Funk Lexicon written by a guy called Peter Wermelinger. You know that? He’s written actual matrix numbers around the labels so you can tell what the original pressing is of a lot of these records. Audience Member Thank you. Have you also started, do you go to record labels and stuff and go into the storage and go through their old tape and print? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Usually the people we are dealing with a lot of time are just individuals. They just happened to have been in a band 30 odd years ago and they’re usually private individuals today rather than record companies. Because the records we are interested in would be small labels. Independents that may have only had one or two releases. They aren’t really like record companies any more. Occasionally record companies will have archives of tapes, but they’re pretty rare. A lot of the singles we are interested in by their very nature of being obscure means that there’s only a handful of releases on the label. Because of that, they just never developed into fully-fledged record companies that have got a huge back catalog. If they did they would have been eaten up by someone like Universal by now. Audience Member Does the tape actually follow… Sorry I’m asking a lot of questions. Do you have a one-shot deal where the tape is going to fall apart by the end of it? Is it stressful? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, that’s happened. Where they snap or they stretch. They are very fragile. They haven’t been used in years and years. It’s actually tapes in the ’80s are the worse. The ’60s and ’70s ones are all right. It’s the tapes in the late ’70s or the ’80s that are worst for shedding. Having said that, there’s a process where you put them into an oven and you bake them in special places that do that. They bake the adhesive that sticks the actual metal particles to the actual base of the tape that comes apart. It bakes it so that it sticks it back together again. It can be pretty effective. You get a pretty good sound out of it in the end. Audience Member You have to cook reel-to-reel tape basically. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Not in your oven at home. There’s special places that do it. It can only be done once. Once it is done you have and you’ve done the transfer, it’s knackered. You can’t really use it again after that. Once it’s been done and digitized then it’s kept forever. It’s permanent. Audience Member Have you ever come across anything like a fake? Somebody’s just released something just recently, but they’ve tried to make out like it’s some really rare record? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short You mean like someone’s just released something now? Recorded now and pretended it was done years ago? I don’t think you’d be able to because you can just tell by the sound quality. The stuff that was recorded say 30 years ago was done on analog equipment with old microphones, old techniques. You can, I can tell a mile off if it’s been done now. I’ve heard so many old records. Occasionally I might get tricked a bit, but it would be pretty difficult I think now. At least, you’d have to record it in the, not just with the old equipment, but in the old manner, in the old techniques as well. It would have to be mastered and pressed in the old way. The sound you get now of doing things is totally different to the sound of how things recorded were done in the old days. A lot different. Audience Member Do you ever find that you hear a sample in a song that you know hasn’t been cleared and have you ever gotten into the legalities of that? Have people ever called you up and be like... Do you know what I mean? Because being with your incredible wealth of knowledge I’m sure you recognize samples a lot more than most people would. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Kind of. I mean, not that many people use samples now. They people that do are quite high profile and they’ll clear it. Like the Talib Kweli one we mentioned earlier. That was cleared through us. If he used that and sold a hell of a lot of records as a result of not having cleared it then I would’ve obviously done something about it, because it means that there’s people down the line that are being exploited for the music that released, that they’re not getting compensated for. If it’s just a local record or someone doing a mixtape or something that’s not really, in the great scheme of things, of huge significance, then it doesn’t really matter, does it? I don’t really think it’s an issue. Audience Member You’ve never sort of caught someone or anything like that? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short There’s some issues that we’ve had where people have bootlegged things that we’ve got an interest in the copyright in, and we have to call them up and tell them off. That sort of thing, yeah. There’s a few things where it’s gone a bit further than that. Generally, it’s in the past, those things. A lot of people that do a little bootlegs like that, they’re just small, fly-by operations or so, like 500 or 1,000 copies, you don’t know who did it. There’s nothing you can do about it. But people who try and sell thousands and thousands of copies and try and pass their reissues off as being legal, there’s not very many of them left, but they’re people that I’m not too keen on. I’ll try and do something if I can. Generally you can’t find out who they are, and if you can, there’s not a lot you can do about it anyway. I have actually had to do a few things like that, yeah. You’ve got to protect your copyrights, it’s as simple as that. I’m sure that everyone out there who makes music, if you’d release something on a CD and someone else put out without your permission, you wouldn’t be too happy about it. Especially if they’re making a lot of money out of it. You wouldn’t be happy about it at all. Regardless of how old it is. Even in 20 years’ time. If you hear your music that you made now in 20 years time being used by someone else, sampled or reissued, and you hadn’t heard about it and someone just told you, and you hadn’t been told, notified, or paid, then you’re not really too happy. Audience Member What about with someone who’s bought a really rare record from you that’s then put it onto the internet or something like that, made it available for download. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I know a couple of sites have done that anyway, and again, you know, it depends on the scale. If it’s a small scale, or it’s not making a hell of a lot of money out of it, then it doesn’t really matter. It’s just for the fun. Some of the artists, for instance, we’ve met, have pointed out the fact that there’s a site called funk45.com, and on it is just a database with lots and lots of sound clips. Some of them have said, “Look, we don’t like the fact that our record is being represented on this, but we’re not getting paid for it and everything.” We’re like, it’s just a one minute clip, and the guy’s doing it... He actually has to pay to do it, he’s not making any money out of it. He’s just spreading to the world the fact that this record is out there, and that it exists. It’s not doing any harm, it’s just like a library. That’s one end of the spectrum, where I find it doing more good than harm. But on the other hand, if someone’s literally done it just to make money out of it, without having paid any copyright fees or anything like that, and doing it on quite a large scale, then that’s the other end of this thing. That’s where I don’t think it should be allowed. Audience Member Are you pretty near and dear to the exclusivity of having these records be rare? Would you ever put them on the internet as a means to make money? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short You mean me put them on the internet? Audience Member Yeah, as opposed to selling records. Add to a part on your shop, like I saw on your website you can add to cart or whatever, would you ever consider selling singles as MP3s that are records? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Some of them we have got the copyright where they’re available for download on some service, but I can’t remember which one it is. The idea really is to make sure that the music that we’ve spent a lot of time to uncover is basically represented properly in the media, whether it’s on a record, or on a CD, or on a download, and the appropriate royalties filter down to whoever owns the copyright. The money that we get from making these CDs and the 45s is contractually obliged to filter down as proper royalties, the people that actually made the music, or producers, or the record company. Whoever owns it in the first place, regardless of whether it’s released on the internet or on a CD, or on a 45, makes no difference of the format, really. As long as they get their royalties and what to do to be paid at the end of the day, that’s the important thing. Audience Member Actually, I would like to put a small command. You’ve mentioned that maybe it’s not that smart to pay a lot of money for one certain particular record, just because you like it and you have to maybe try to find another place where you can buy it for two dollars. But you know what, just five years ago, I met those British guys, Karminsky Experience, maybe you know them? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah. Audience Member They are collecting ’60s strange, weird sounds, this incredible strange music. We went to the store in Moscow, and they actually found five records that they really liked, but the store was quite expensive. They didn’t buy it, because they said, “Wow, you know, I think I wouldn’t buy it for 50 dollars,” or something. I think, why actually you cannot pay some kind of a price for the record you really like, and you know that the record is very rare, and it is very difficult to evaluate actually the sound, the cost of the sound. I believe that if you really like something, if you really need it, and actually the sound is very rare, there’s a certain quantity of copies, why can’t you? This, I think, is not smart. Just to forget about the record just because it costs more than you expected. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short That’s true. Maybe they didn’t have much money with them at the time or something. Everyone’s got a limit for a record. Some people specifically say, “Right, I will not pay more than ten pounds or twenty pounds, or a hundred pounds for any record, no matter how much you like.” It’s just a means of keeping control of their finances. Everyone’s got a limit on what they want to spend on something. They may really, really like that record, but, like I said, it may have been over that limit. Or they may have liked another record just as much that cost half the price. Everyone’s different, everyone’s got their own means of assessing the value of how much they want to pay for something, even if something’s below market value. Supposing that record was a hundred pounds, but everyone in the world sells it for five hundred, that means what they’re getting is a bargain, in essence. It’s like four hundred pounds cheaper than what the going rate is. But they may still not have bought it because of the fact that it’s above their limit. On the other hand, they might have bought it knowing they could sell it for five hundred. Everyone’s got their own reasons for wanting to buy stuff at a certain price or not. Usually if people say they’ve got a limit, say a hundred pounds, whatever, to buy a record, then it doesn’t really mean much. You only have to offer them something that they really, really, really, really want for 103 pounds, and they’ll probably buy it for three pounds more than their limit. Then it just never stops, and it could be 110, it just goes on forever. Especially if it’s worth a lot more, and then they could buy it, justifying it by saying they could sell it for a lot more. Everyone says they’ve got limits, but I don’t believe it really, for that reason. Audience Member Last thing, I actually have to thank you for putting Marlena Shaw “California Soul” on your label because now all my friends are so into this tune. It’s incredible. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short It is a good one, that’s for sure. Audience Member Thanks. Audience Member Question, while you were researching the music of this time frame, did you discover anything about studio techniques or micing techniques? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, Malcolm, who works with me, he’s a drummer. He did one of the Red Bull workshops a couple of years ago. He’s actually built himself a studio using a lot of old gear from the ‘60s and the ‘50s. Whenever we go together to meet a lot of the guys, especially the producers, he asks a lot about the techniques. Sometimes he’s bought some equipment from them and found out about how to do it. Personally I don’t have too much of an interest in it, because I’m too busy doing other stuff as well. But he’s learned quite a bit about it. Especially about drum placement, mic placement for drums, because there’s definitely an art in it that is being lost I think over the years. Just because basically people don’t record bands so much in studios like they did in the past. People obviously don’t use tape these days like they used to, and a lot of the other equipment, whether it’s compressors or RDQs, or whatever. There’s so much stuff now that it’s all done on computers, so a lot of the techniques are being lost these days definitely, yeah. I wish I knew a bit more about it myself, but I never really need to know it myself, so I just sort of gone a bit over my head when they’re talking about it together. Audience Member With this whole resurgence with Quantic and stuff like that now, coming out with that sort of ... Trying to trace back that sort of sound, do you think it’s renewed interest in 7”s again? I know a lot of friends who maybe in the last two to four years started going back to seven inches because they sort of learned to discover true music by Quantic and Tru Thoughts, stuff like that. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I think there is, to a certain extent. A lot of people maybe have heard a seven inch for the first time, or an old funk single for the first time, and they’re captivated by... Because it is a different sound. You don’t get the dynamics that you get on a digital sound, or a CD. To some people, they may not like it as much. Other people, they’re like, “Wow, I’ve never heard anything like that before,” it sounds really fresh to their ears. They’re really keen on it and they’ll start looking into trying to get that sort of sound and trying to record like that now. I think that a lot of the benefits of that sound have been lost over the years. I don’t know, in a lot of ways it sounds quite authentic and... Audience Member Nostalgic? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Nostalgic, in a way. It’s only nostalgic if you’ve heard it before. If you never heard it before, then you’ve got nothing to compare it to. It just sounds new in a way, because a lot of people now they’ve only heard music that’s been done digitally or through a computer. If you’re hearing an analog recording for the very first time, hearing it on vinyl, then it sounds totally different to you, and it does sound fresh, it does sound new. Even though it is being done before, it’s been done for years and years before. It just hasn’t been done in a modern context. It’s the old, from the ’60s, ’70s, being played now and coming into for now. Audience Member I wonder how it for you, when you listen to all of this at home, the sound quality of all of this and then when you switch on radio and you hear all this digital stuff, how does it feel? For your ears maybe? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short A lot of it sounds really, really good, but it doesn’t get inside me. A lot of it, I think... I listened ... A friend of mine, he’s put this new system in his car. The bass is so deep, it’s like under the ground. The treble is, it sounds awesome. But it doesn’t... For my ears, it doesn’t get inside my bones. I don’t feel it as much. I just think, “That’s technically pretty good.” But I don’t feel it in terms of I would do normal music, where I try and imagine the band playing. I can’t imagine a drummer playing a kick drum or a bass player playing the bass so low that it’s like that. It doesn’t seem real to me. For me personally to appreciate music properly, I’ve got to imagine it being real, played by people. That’s just my personal viewpoint. The music that I really like and enjoy, and feel passionate about, is the human touch of music like that. Music that is artificially created, if you like, I just don’t... It sounds nice and everything, but I just don’t feel it. Audience Member It’s obviously very important for you to give back to the artists, their dues and everything. Has there ever been a situation where you may have sort of reopened some old wound or something like that? For example, some artist is being ripped off by their label, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, something like that, and when you’ve come along and re-released their stuff, and the label owner says, “Hey, I want my cut of that,” or whatever? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, it can be tricky sometimes, because on some occasions you do open up a can of worms, where you’re talking to someone who says, “Oh, I’m the copyright owner,” and, “Pay me the money.” Then you talk to the guitarist, and they say, “Oh no, it was me,” and you talk to the drummer and they say, “No, it was me.” They all start arguing and everything. On other occasions, for instance the record we played earlier, the Universals, the “New Generation” one, what happened with them is they saved up the money together, they made the records, and the records got sent from the distributor to the stores, but somewhere along the line they got lost. The records never actually turned up, so they spent all this money for nothing. They just disappeared somewhere. They don’t even know if they were properly pressed. That’s a band that didn’t have a hell of a lot of money to start off with and wasn’t really commercially successful, and they put all their money into this venture for nothing. They, in effect, got completely stitched up and ripped off by whoever was making their records for them. They’re pretty tough for 30 years on to actually get released again properly. Like I was saying earlier as well, some people expect that they are thinking I’m trying to get them to pay me to be able to have record put on a CD. They just appreciate to have had it put out in the first place. Audience Member Is that maybe indicative of more of a Wild West attitude back in the day? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Yeah, it was pretty bad back in the day. There was just no rules back in those days. The music business, it really was a tricky industry to be in. There’s a lot of sharks out there. I mean, it’s still bad now, obviously, but in those days there were a lot less collection societies, and there’s a lot less regulation going on. It was normal to pay the DJ backhanded to play your record on the radio. You had to use your wit and imagination, hustling skill, whatever, to get your record out there. Or to get pressed in the first place. It’s a tricky business. Just like it is now, to get your record heard as opposed to someone else’s. A lot of hustling going on. Audience Member Sorry I’m hogging the mic, sorry people. Just another question, have any of the artists that you’ve re-released... I know you said you found them in nursing homes and stuff like that, but has it maybe reignited an opportunity for them to tour or to come out of retirement or something like that? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I wish I could. I’ve tried to organize some things like that, there’s one band it brings to mind is the Soul Tornadoes. They were based in Akron, in Ohio, it was two brothers. One played bass, the other played organ. We said, “Look, why don’t you get together? We’ll bring you over to England and record.” I paid for some of them. One of the other guys is in California. I paid them to get together, to the hurdles and everything, but the main problem is it’s all about money. This, at the end of the day, is minority music. It’s not going to sell shitloads of copies, they’re not going to make millions of pounds doing it. To be able to get a band and afford for them to fly all the way to the UK, and get gigs there to make it cost effective, it’s not easy at all. I’ve tried to do it, but the sums don’t really add up, unfortunately. You can get maybe one person over, say a singer, but even then you’re only going to get one or two gigs. My forte is not promoting, that’s another cat and the fish altogether. I do enough as it is. To be able to promote concerts and bands and gigs and what have you, is something else entirely. So much as I’d like to get people over, a whole band or even not a band but just a singer, is quite difficult thing to do. The best I’ve been able to do is basically pass on the details of some of these people, to Adrian Gibson at the Jazz Café, because he’s one of the main people interested in doing this sort of thing and saying, “Look, if you want to get so and so over, here’s the number, give them a call and get them to come over.” This November we’re getting Robert Moore, who’s a soul singer from Florida, he’s coming over to perform. To help pay for it, Adrian’s getting him to record with Speedometer, to actually put a single out as well, and trying to get him two gigs instead of just one. As much as the intentions are, it’s not easy, especially, you know, mostly because of the plane flights and everything, and the expense involved. Otherwise, I’d love to get more people over. Some people it has worked really well, like Marlena Shaw, she comes over regularly now. People like Spanky Wilson, that Quantic’s getting involved with. Gwen McCrae, she comes over quite a lot. So some of them do get quite a good reputation and are able to come to the UK and do a little mini-tour, or go on Europe. Like I said, it’s not something that I’ve got the time really to get involved with. Audience Member I’m curious to know, over the past number of years we’ve had quite a few of the mess of old jazz labels like Impulse! and Blue Note and Verve and the like, open up their back catalog for remixes and stuff. Just wondering how you are with that as a concept or are you happy to let it go, or is it sort of sacrilege? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short I haven’t actually heard any of them, so I would really... I don’t really know. If it’s anything to do with keeping the music alive, then I’m all for it. Just because the records are made 20 or 30 or 40 years ago doesn’t mean to say that they should be overlooked. If you haven’t heard it before, then it’s new, as far as I’m concerned. Whether it was recorded yesterday or 50 years ago. A lot of people complain about old music, they say, “It doesn’t sound new, it doesn’t sound modern or anything,” but if you haven’t heard it then you can’t really say that, because it’s not old music, is it? It still would be new to your ears. If it does need a modern touch to be able to get it to people’s ears, then I think it’s a good thing in the sense that it’ll certainly make people realize that there is old music out there, even if it has been modernized. It may turn people on to looking back into the past and seeing what other stuff has been back then and appreciating it for what it is as well. Especially if you hear them both side by side. Audience Member Have you had any situations where the material that you put out on Jazzman has come up with master tapes that people have been interested in stepping up to that? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Quantic did a remix, the very first song we played earlier, the “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,” Quantic did a remix of that. That’s the only thing we’ve done in that sense. Some people have asked us to do things like that. Generally I don’t really have the time to follow it through, quite honestly. There’s so many things going on, and these projects where people say, “Can I remix this?” Or what have you, is not really top of my agenda. I’ve just got too much other work to do to keep putting new things out, rather than remixing old things and I’d have to think of a whole new format and label to put it on and what have you. If they want to do it, then they can do it, but I’m not really... I don’t really have the time to go in that direction myself. Audience Member Cheers. Audience Member I imagine you’ve been involved with some pretty serious record trades over the years. Have you got any good stories? Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Record trades? Well, trades by their nature, they’re not really... There’s some good record buying stories, where you find hordes of records and they’re going really cheap because the guy doesn’t know what they are or something. But trades, most people know what they are in the sense that if you’re trading records, you pretty much know what you’re doing. You’re not going to trade a really rare record for something that’s rubbish, and vice versa. Probably the best record find ever was a master tape of Mickey & the Soul Generation, which we found in Texas. No one even knew it existed, and got pulled out and it said “complete album” on there. That was just one of those things that makes you sink to your knees and your heart start pumping, because it’s like I found a whole album by this legendary band that no one knew existed. That was a pretty good find, for digging. That’s amazing when that sort of thing happens. Buying records and what have you, I don’t know. I’ve been ripped off, just like everyone else has been, but for every time I’ve been ripped off, I’ve had a good result myself by finding stuff, something worth a lot of money that the guy only wants five dollars for or something, too. When it comes to the ethics of that, like I was saying earlier, if the artist is selling his own records, you can’t pay them cheap money for stuff, you have to give them proper price. The way to do it is if the guy is actually in the business of selling records, like if he’s in a store or if he’s a dealer and he wants five dollars for a record that you know is worth a hundred dollars, then there’s nothing wrong with that as far as I’m concerned. That’s his business to know. But an artist, it’s not his business to know the value of his records. Most people are pretty clued up anyway, the internet has changed it. The internets and pop cycle of eBay have sort of leveled the prices up for a lot of records. Benji B OK, Gerald ‘Jazzman’ thank you very much. Gerald ‘Jazzman’ Short Thank you.

IG Culture
IG Culture has been a leading figure in the UK’s underground since 1990, when Dodge City Productions’ “accidental” deal with Island Records catapulted him into the spotlight. Following those early forays IG established himself as one of London’s most reliable producers, a man with an ear for classic sounds that is equally comfortable twisting up new styles, producing for the likes of Monday Michiru and Roots Manuva. In the early 2000s, he became part of London’s short-lived but influential broken beat scene, producing and releasing tunes under the New Sector Movements project alongside fellow local luminaries like Bugz In The Attic.
In his lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, the man born Ian Grant discusses his roots in hip-hop, the London warehouse scene, early mistakes and the influence of fusion on his style.
Hosted by BENJI B What do we call that? IG Culture London bruk boogie. BENJI B IG, welcome. Thanks so much for getting on the plane. IG’s just been here for an hour, just
touched down an hour ago. Thanks a lot for making the effort to join us this evening. IG Culture Thanks for having me. I actually found out about it Sunday and they said, “Can
you make it Monday?” I said, “It’s too early, too soon.” So they got me on on
Tuesday. So this is straight off the cuff. I haven’t got anything prepared, just raw. BENJI B Do you want to introduce yourself - name and where you’re from for those who
don’t know? IG Culture My name’s IG. I’m from London, I’ve been involved in many movements in London over the past 15 years: hip-hop, soul, funk, rare groove, the broken beat movement. I’ve been involved in sound systems as a youth. I’m also involved in New Sector Movements, Son of Scientist, Likwid Biskit, Quango, I’m a part of the Co-Op club and the Co-Op label. The list goes on. That’s some of the few things I do. BENJI B And whereabouts are you from originally? IG Culture I’m from West London, Acton. Pretty much grew up in Acton. Now I reside in Ladbroke Grove. BENJI B Musically speaking, you just listed so many pseudonyms people might be
familiar with, but what was the first thing that got you interested and why? IG Culture The first thing that got me started was writing lyrics, and that was through
reggae, listening to the DJs from Jamaica, I was into the sound system thing,
got involved in sound systems. That’s basically where I got the name IG
Culture. The youths I grew up with called me IG, so that name kind of stuck with me. Now I’m a big old man, and they still call me IG Culture. BENJI B It’s fair to say a lot of contemporary music from London the last 25 years
is influenced by sound system culture. Can you tell us when you got involved in
sound systems and how it shaped your musical journey? IG Culture Living in London is basically like this: so much music comes into London, it’s
like a testing ground for so many sounds worldwide, and we absorb all of it.
As well as being into sound systems, I was also into electro and soul music and
even pop music at the time. We listened to all of it. As a youth, I used to go a place called
Hammersmith Palais and dance to a DJ called Steve Walsh and Tim Westwood, who
used to play soul music at the time. So, even Tim Westwood’s roots stem back to
soul and reggae, though you wouldn’t know it now because it was Tim Westwood who
brought through a London MC named General Levy. It doesn’t seem like it now,
but he has got some roots. BENJI B Talk to me about the early days of the British hip-hop scene because
obviously, that had a big influence on your first group, Dodge City. IG Culture There was a lot of good things at the time. There was Gunshot, IQP, which ended up being Roots Manuva, I think that’s correct. We had so many groups. Americans probably don’t know it, but way back, t was on a par with what they were doing. If you weigh it up, cheesy rap for cheesy rap at the time, it was the same. It’s just that America had the backing and it’s history now, it just went sky high. I guess, we kept it more real. [laughter / applause] BENJI B So tell me about Dodge City. IG Culture Dodge City happened by accident. I was doing parties with a guy. At the time
we had a thing called the warehouse party where we’d go to a warehouse, kick off
the door, jack some electricity from somewhere. And he used to rap some verses
that he knew from records and I used to do the same. We’d take the piss out of
each other. I hadn’t seen him for a while and we met up again. He was doing a
studio course and I’d just bought a W30, which was a really old sampler, which
had about ten seconds sampling time. We decided to get together and see what
we could come up with and within six months we had a record deal with Island
Records. So it really happened by accident because I wasn’t going to be in a group
with him. I just said, “I’ll make some beats for you.” It just happened really
quick, next thing you know we’re doing shit. BENJI B What period was this? IG Culture This was 1990. BENJI B Have you got anything on your computer you want to play from that? IG Culture No, no. [laughter] BENJI B Come on, I know you have. IG Culture No, I haven’t actually. [looks through computer] BENJI B How was the experience of being thrown into the major record label thing at
that age at that time? IG Culture I was a ghetto youth at that time. I didn’t have any experience, came into it
with all my ghetto-isms, was a little naïve, done things in a very naïve way,
made a lot of mistakes, fell out with a lot of people and learned a lot. It
was that learning curve at that period that’s taken me here. A lot of groups
from the time - and in London at the time, there were so many black groups
signed on major labels - when you check the groups and follow their careers,
none of them has lasted. It’s tough to keep going, reinventing yourself and
feeding the public. It was a tough lesson to learn. After Dodge City got
dropped I had to decide what I wanted to do. Do I want to carry on the way I’m
going or do I want to be serious about it? The Dodge City situation wasn’t
really about us doing great music. We were really naïve. In hindsight, it was about learning. BENJI B And then in 2003, your New Sector Movements got signed to Virgin. That was
coming full circle back to the majors again, you could apply that learning curve to that experience. IG Culture Well, I was ready. Between Dodge City parting company from Island to getting
signed to Virgin, that’s a good eight years. I spent the whole time in the studio reinventing myself, basically. I was originally a rapper, an MC, and by the
time I got signed to Virgin, I was a producer. OK, I’m going to have kick some ass as a producer now. Benji B What’s the One Drop thing in the middle, talk to me about One Drop. IG Culture When I parted company from Island Records, actually it was a subsidiary of Island Records, it was 4th & B’Way, after I parted company I was vexed, and I was vexed about a lot of stuff. I don’t want nothing to do with the industry at all, I just want to do it myself. Just like, I got cold-hearted and ignorant about it. And that’s another learning curve cos you can’t do it on your own. So I started this label called One Drop and the whole point was to hook up with young MCs and give ‘em a opportunity to rhyme on better quality productions, that’s what I thought at the time, and basically give them a outlet through the One Drop label and I ended up doing four albums with that label before Virgin started paying attention to what I was doing. BENJI B And you were doing remixes all the way through. IG Culture I was doing remixes from Dodge City right through to the start of New Sector
Movements. I was remixing Gang Starr, The Luniz, Heavy D, Digital Underground, that kind of thing. BENJI B How did you end up with New Sector Movements and what is it? IG Culture The positive that thing I got out of saying, “I don’t give a shit about what’s
going on out there, I’m just going to do my thing,” was the fact that I got into music.
I really got into buying… going to record fairs, checking out stuff I never
heard before. Got into fusion deeply, jazz, even more reggae, even more soul, even
more hip-hop and I started paying attention to artists on the records. I started paying
attention to what they were actually playing, so I ended up buying a Rhodes, buying
some Arp’s, a Hammond, Wurlitzer, I bought the lot. I bought an SP-1200, I
just got all the tools that I needed to say, “OK, I’m going to be a producer.” BENJI B When we have discussions, it always comes back to jazz and reggae. Are there
any artists from those periods you still like to play now? IG Culture This is just totally random, I’m drawing tunes from my iTunes. This tune blew
me away when I first heard it, I found it at a record fair. (music: The Heath Brothers – “Smilin’ Billy Suite”) That’s the Heath Brothers. BENJI B Any particular artists - I know there are so many - any artists we should run down that are major, major influences, turning points? IG Culture Yeah, one of the main influences for fusion is George Duke. There’s a few
albums, Feel, I Love The Blues, She Heard Me Cry, then there’s another one, I can’t remember the name of it, I think it’s the first album on MPS. But yeah, George Duke is a big influence. [looks through computer] BENJI B Anyone else? IG Culture Herbie Hancock. I’m into Norman Connors, Horace Tapscott, the list goes on,
Chick Corea. I could just reel off names and their albums deep. That’s the good thing about those artists. They didn’t just do one or two albums and fizzle, they’re 20, 30 albums deep. They’re not temporary. BENJI B What’s this a loose cover of? IG Culture This is a group I’m involved with called Likwid Biskit, which is me and a
character called Kaidi Tatham, and this is a tune called “Herbs and Spice” and it’s basically, yeah, licking a shot to Herbie Hancock. (music: Likwid Biskit – “Herbs And Spice” / applause) Thanks. BENJI B You’ve got another one lined up there that you wanted to play. IG Culture Yeah, I was talking about George Duke earlier, and I did a cover of a tune he
did called “That’s What She Said.” I tried to do a bruk version of it. (music: Likwid Biskit - That’s What She Said / applause) BENJI B Is that one coming out? IG Culture That’s been out. That was about ‘94, ‘95, I think. BENJI B All drums programmed, yeah? IG Culture Yeah. BENJI B You mentioned that pretty much everything you do, the drums are programmed. IG Culture Yeah. I’ve actually had drum lessons, so I’ve got an idea of jazz or
something. But yeah, if you can say it, you can play it. BENJI B You mentioned Kaidi playing on that piece. You’ve had the good fortune
to work with some amazing musicians. Why don’t you tell us about some of them? IG Culture I worked with Kaidi Tatham on that. He’s not widely known, but he’s a genius,
I think. I also do a project with a cat named Pino Palladino, who I’ve been
working with lately on some stuff and he’s dangerous. Sometimes you’ll just
sit watching him. Yeah, I’ve been working with Pino. On another project, there’s a cat named Eric Appapoulay, another cat out of London who’s equally as deadly. There’s a lot of unknown cats who can really throw it down. So that’s three names; Pino Palladino, Kaida Tatham and Eric Appapoulay. BENJI B Is Eric on the album? IG Culture Yeah. BENJI B Shall we play that? IG Culture Benji’s getting into his DJ mode. BENJI B I think we should bring it up to the New Sector Movements era, then we can
take it into the broken thing. Do you want to talk to us about the first New
Sector Movements album? What was the idea behind that whole collective? IG Culture New Sector Movements started with me and a singer Bembe Segue and it later
developed into Eska Mtungwazi, Kaida Tatham, Chix With Stix, Julie Dexter.
These are all people from London. Virgin said, “You’re getting a lot of press
at the moment, so we’ll take anything, any project.” The A&R man was going
to the boss with stuff a lot, but they weren’t really feeling it until we
were in The Face magazine; that’s when the boss said, “OK, let’s do an album.”
They didn’t actually understand what I was doing, but they said, “Just do an
Album. Don’t worry about doing anything commercial, just do what you feel.” So
that’s exactly what I did. I mixed New Sector Movements up with Likwid Biskit,
just some left-of-center madness. I called the album Download This, and it
came out in 2001, according to Benji. BENJI B I think. What’s this tune? IG Culture This tune’s off an EP, which was released at the same time on Virgin. We got
totally arty about it, we got Doze Green to do the artwork; we just wanted to
do a great piece of work with great artwork, throw it out there and see what
happens. This is off the No Tricks EP, and this is called “Para.” (music: New Sector Movements – “Para” / applause) IG CULTURE The last lyric of that bit was supposed
to be, “I’m fucking paranoid,” but I said, “No, Eric, let’s tone it down a
little.” But that’s just London slang - “para” means you’re paranoid. BENJI B I think it’s fair to say the focus, the rhythmic focus is always the
central focus. IG Culture Well, yeah. This thing called broken beat… BENJI B That’s where I’m going. Who came up with that? IG Culture I was doing this stuff. Phil Asher, who’s Phil Asher from Restless Soul, for
those who don’t know, and Orin Walters, who’s also known as Afronaught from
Bugz In the Attic, another London group, they started to call this kind of groove, “that broken stuff.” And there’s a paper called Echoes who asked me what this stuff was called, and I said, “It’s going to be called broken beat.”
Next minute, in another magazine, it said, “Phil Asher and IG Culture: the
inventors of broken beat.” So that’s how the term came about. Further down the
line, some people disassociated themselves with it. It just became a thing to
do like house, just do a broken groove which is a standard
pattern now. But at the time broken was anything you wanted it to be. It
wasn’t meant to be [makes broken beat with his mouth]. So that’s basically
the story of broken. BENJI B A lot of people going to your club are now expecting to hear exactly that
beat. How do you feel about that term and has it boxed you in? IG Culture We probably created a monster, because when we started the Co-Op club in London, there
would only be a few people in there. People were like, “What are they
playing?” and just staring at us. BENJI B When did it start? IG Culture Co-Op started early 2000, so we’re in our seventh year now. Nowadays, you play
anything else and people won’t dance. They come expecting to hear broken beat
and it’s developed in such a short period of time. It’s pigeon-holed itself.
It got to the point where it was only being influenced by itself. BENJI B How do you get around that? IG Culture By going back to the beginning and saying, “Fuck it! Let’s make some music
again.” Because it’s not about just being standard so a DJ can have 16 bars to
mix in a record. It’s that side, but it’s also about keeping music out
there to give people ideas, keep them inspired. BENJI B Those first two years when it was at Velvet Rooms was some of the most
inspiring times musically. What was your vision for taking it into the
future with the DJs you set it up with? And who did you set the club up with? IG Culture I set it up with Dego from 4Hero and a guy named Demus from a band called Two Banks of Four. I knew Demus from the ‘90s, he was the producer behind Young Disciples, and he came round my flat and played me 4Hero. We sat down and we were talking, and he was interested in what I was doing and this new sound. I
said, “We’d do something,” so one of the things I did was I got him an advance
to do the Numbers album, which I released on Main Squeeze, the label I was
running at the time. And we also talked about setting up a club because at the
time all these records are appearing; you’ve got Dego with his 2000 Black
thing, Bugz in The Attic with Neon Phusion, me with New Sector Movements and
Likwid Biskit, Domu, Seiji, G-Force, a lot of these cats were starting to do
this music, but there was nowhere you could go to hear it. So we decided to
set up a club, and when we set it up, there was just a few people in there in
the tumbleweed. But it kind of just grew and went from strength to strength.
We got a couple of awards out of it, though that’s not the important thing.
But yeah, it really grew. BENJI B: What was the musical ethos as a club? IG Culture: At the time, Dego was involved and he wanted nothing earlier than, like, ‘95 or
something. We wanted to play all our music, but we wanted to play everything
we thought that was good; we didn’t want to play just one thing. On the flyer, we put broken beat and future jazz, whatever that is. So at the early Co-Op
you could expect to hear all kinds of stuff. You wouldn’t know what to expect
because it was all fresh at the time. Benji B There’s definitely a strong open-mic thing at the club as well right? IG Culture Yeah. I think I brought that reggae element in it where I would let off reggae soundsystem sound effects, and I would chat on the mic yard style. We had the whole mix, we had the dubplate thing where it got to a point where every track was a dubplate. It’s just like the same thing kind of happening again. It’s happening in so many different scenes. It’s happened in the drum % bass thing, and it started to happen in the broken beat scene. It got to a point all you’re hearing is dubplates. If it’s not a Domu dubplate, it’s a Dego dubplate. If it’s not a Dego dubplate, it’s a Kaidi and Bugz In The Attic dubplate. Half the audience loved it, half the audience was frustrated because they would come back to the club to hear that tune they heard a few weeks ago and they’re hearing something fresh. We just kept moving so far ahead. At times, certain DJs left the club and went to the studio and made tunes because they heard something on the night and it blew their mind, so they just went to the studio and made music, and that was a regular occurrence. It got so intense. Some DJs would come to the club like a guest and panic just because, you know, the crowd was intense as well. It was a crazy thing. Benji B Still is. IG Culture Yeah, still is. Benji B Even more packed. And where is the club now? IG Culture It’s at a place called Plastic People in London, certain mans know. [laughs] BENJI B: And how have you seen the crowd change over the years? IG Culture This is real, right? When it started, it was just us. Then, the crowd was trendy
and white. Then, it was trendy white and Japanese with some sprinklings of
black. Then, it was more blacks. Then, it was black, white and Japanese. Now,
it’s black with some whites and a sprinkling of Japanese. [laughs] No, it’s
just a mix, everyone comes to the club and mixes with each other, which is a
good thing. BENJI B Talk to me about that “heads thing,” because I know that does your head in.
The heads that come down and wants to hear certain tunes, certain types of
tunes, and wants to put you in your box. IG Culture Well, last Co-Op, Sunday, there’s a crew called the Laser Crew, the infamous
Laser Crew. I call them that because they always came and fired the lasers.
Back in the day, I used to say, “laser,” and they’d fire their lasers off. It
was crazy in there. One of the guys, his name is Cartel, and he’s got this thing
he spins round that sends messages in laser light. So he’d go, “Peven Everett,
Peven Everett.” And I just ignored him, and said, “This is for the Peven
Everett.” There’s a lot of heads in there. There’s a term, they call it “man
beat.” Man beat is tunes only men listen to in the dance, like [yanks hoodie over his head]. [laughter] But actually, the girls do like it, though. The women do like the man beat. [laughs] BENJI B What’s man beat? IG Culture Man beat is… [Benji looks into his computer] Yeah, play man beat. (music: Bugz In The Attic - Future Rage / applause) That’s a big Bugz In The Attic tune. BENJI B It’s great when you can create an environment so inspiring that people are
making tunes especially for the club, with that dancefloor in mind. But how do
you take it beyond that and make it bigger than that, transcending the
boundaries of a club in London and taking it around the world, making it into
something larger? IG Culture The Bugz have definitely been flying the flag for that sound. They’ve been
DJing everywhere. Last year, the year before, they’ve really been flying the
flag of the broken beat thing. Me, for instance, I feel that broken beat was just an accident. I
was never really trying to make a genre called broken beat, I was just trying
to make some music. When I got signed to Virgin, I was in the process of making
a hip-hop album. I had to stop doing that to do this. Seven years later, I
resumed what I was doing before, but it took me down a whole different path. Benji B Around the same time you set up the Co-Op Club, you’re also were involved in People Records and setting up a different type of co-op, a co-op amongst various label heads and musicians and producers and conveniently based in one premises as well. Can you talk to us about that and the strength that gave you as a collective? IG Culture Well, we were all under the same roof, basically. Alex Attias, The Bugz, me, all our music was coming up through a company named Goya Music. At the time Goya Music was really backing what we was doing and we decided we were going to do the Co-Op label, which originally was not linked to the club but it was just a way of us to kind of be under one umbrella and push our music together. Benji B Can you explain the ethos actually behind the term Co-Op and how that, you know, how that translates into the label thing and how you cooperate to make that happen? IG Culture There you go, it’s a cooperative. You know, hopefully the idea is we just cooperate together, help each other out, and when we can’t afford to pay, well, you scratch my back, I scratch yours. Things like that. Benji B You’ve been involved in People Records, Main Squeeze Records, what are the other independents you’ve done? IG Culture The One Drop Label. People, Main Squeeze, Co-Op. I did a label called D Below, which came out with two singles and that was it. Benji B You’re still releasing records now. Tell us about the independent record game and how that’s changed over the last few years. Ig Culture It’s completely different. From... I linked with Goya to now, the whole internet things has taken off. People ain’t even buying records any more. Things are completely changed. I was saying to my mate, “You gotta be a label, a producer, a DJ, and a band.” Benji B If we’re thinking about starting record labels or wanting to put out our own music tomorrow, you know, is there any one thing that you’d say? IG Culture It all depends on what you want to achieve, really. If you want to make records just to make money or you want to make records to make some statements musically. Benji B Do you find... Earlier on, you were saying you’ve recorded under Son of Sciencist, New Sector Movements, Dub Basement, Liquid Biscuit, Kwango, Age of Selfishness, Zuzu, various others. Do you find that that’s, over the years, is that just been a bit of a hindrance, the fact that no one’s really known it’s you. You’ve done so many different projects that people find it hard to keep up? IG Culture No, I don’t think so. I think you’ve just got to be, you’ve got to be a mini industry. That’s the same way labels operate. They throw loads of stuff up and whatever sticks, so I think I just use that same kind of thing. I throw loads of stuff up, and maybe New Sector Movements is sticking. Yeah, or something like Liquid Biscuit. Mainly it’s New sector, but it’s just not carrying all your eggs in one basket. Benji B The last New Sector album was called, you changed the name, right, to NSN? IG Culture Yeah. I wish I didn’t, because I started getting messages from another NSN, was like a Nazi party. They’re coming up on MySpace saying, “You nigga, you nigga.” It’s kind of blending back into New Sector Movements. Benji B Should we play something from that last record? IG Culture Yeah, this is a tune featuring a vocalist I worked with, Eskimo Tungwazi, and this is me with my downtempo head on. It’s a tune called “Don’t Say,” off the last New Sector Movements album. (music: New Sector Movements - “Don’t Say” / applause) BENJI B So I know you’re a man of tunes with a serious record collection, ridiculous record collection.
What kind of stuff was influencing you at that time, things that went into the melting pot? IG Culture Well, clearly, you know what I was listening to at the time. I was influenced by Dilla. [applause] He was just a massive influence. And before Dilla, Pete Rock. I learned
everything about hip-hop from Pete Rock, basically. It took me ages to just work out how he did those filtered basslines. I didn’t know he was filtering out the tune just to leave a rumble. When I realized, I was, “Yeah, right.”
So, Pete Rock, Dilla, Tribe Called Quest. BENJI B Talking of filtering out, what are your weapons of choice in the studio? IG Culture At that time, I was using S5000, Logic 4.7, MPC, SP-1200. They were my main
things, and around that time I was using a Hammond organ, Rhodes, Wurlitzer
and all kinds of vintage drum machines, like Sequential Circuits and even an old
Hammond Bontempi box. There’s a lot of other things I used. On one track on
the first New Sector Movements album I used one of those old RMI electrapianos, like Fela [Kuti] used to use. That kind of equipment. BENJI B Generally using Logic as the main sequencer for all this stuff? IG Culture: Now, I’m using Logic 5. BENJI B Logic 5? IG Culture Yeah, that’s all I’m using. BENJI B: They just installed Logic 8 outside. IG Culture They upgrade so often, but we never really get deep into what we got. I
think I want to stick with 5 for the time being. My mate Venom says he’s going
to install 8 on my system, but I like 5, it’s taken me a year to get my head
‘round it. Benji B What’s changed for you? You were saying that you’ve changed your process, your working process. IG Culture Well, I used to turn up to a studio with a car full of equipment and it’s just long, turning up to a studio with a computer, all kinds of equipment, and now I’m turning up with my iPod with the track on it. It’s crazy. There’s a danger of someone’s sound suffering because of how easy it is to make music, and I’ve really had to keep my eye on that and watch that. Benji B How have you dealt with that? IG Culture By not depending on kick and snare off of EXS because the waveforms are that thin. It’s just like a snapshot of a kick. You hear the kick but you don’t feel the kick. It’s the same with the snares and the hi hats. You’ve got to find ways to beef it up. BENJI B Has your music changed as it’s gone completely digital? Have you had other
people telling you your stuff sounds different now? IG Culture I’m getting more work since I’ve gone digital. [laughs] I’m here, aren’t I? I’m getting more work, but I’m still being real with it, I’m still doing my thing and I’m still, as far as I’m concerned, not compromising. I’ve got this far by not compromising, so why change now? BENJI B: So musically, you’re starting everything inside the box and you’re mixing
inside the box too? You’re not going through any boards? IG Culture Well, I mix through ProTools. I do all my mixing through ProTools. There will
be some projects I will mix on a board. I’ll use a Neve Desk, but I still find
a way to make it sound warm through ProTools. BENJI B Any tips for us? IG Culture Don’t use reverbs. BENJI B So everything’s still dry when you’re using digital as if it was in analog.
You’re not tempted by all those space designer plug-ins and stuff? IG Culture No. OK, I might use a little slap here and there, slap reverb, just to give an
illusion of space, but I pretty much want to my stuff to hit hard but dry. For
instance, this is just my personal opinion, I hate when a vocal is slicked up
and prettied up and the meat of the vocal is hidden behind reverbs. I want to
hear the real artist. That’s why when I worked with people like Eska Mtungwazi
and Les Nubians, I did it bone dry, not a reverb in sight. BENJI B Have you got anything new from the new IG era, a dubplate to play us,
something brand new? IG Culture I’m doing a project for a brand new label in Japan. Their name is Freedom
School. They approached me to do a concept album, they wanted me to do a piece
that’s 20 minutes long that goes through all the eras of spiritual black
music. Let’s say, how you would hear some jazz on a label like Strata East? I
don’t know if you know the label, but the music was very conceptual, it wasn’t too
concerned with hooks and stuff. OK, there were hooks, but it was more about
just the feeling than the chorus. So I’ve just done another mad excursion.
This project I’ve called Zen Badizm. That was one of the other things they
Wanted. They wanted it to be very black. [laughter] [imitates Japanese accent] “The Japanese-oh, very black-oh.” So I went very
black, this is a piece featuring Pino Palladino on bass. [starts track then
quickly stops it] In fact, I won’t play that one. I’ll go further in. The
next section of this is influenced by bebop and Sun Ra, then it goes into one
of my all-time classics, “Girl You Need a Change of Mind” by Eddie Kendricks. (music: IG Culture – “B Free,””Girl You Need a Change of Mind” / applause) Thanks. Cheers. The vocalist featured on that is a cat named Bilal Salaam from DC, so he’s a name to look out for. BENJI B When’s that coming out? IG Culture It was supposed to have been this year, but I took my time with it so I think
it will be early next year. BENJI B So IG Culture, the end of 2007 and beyond, what have you got coming up? IG Culture Well, next month I’m off to the motherland. I’m off to Senegal and Uganda to
continue a project I started to commemorate the abolishment of slavery. It was a
project started by the British Council. They invited visual and musical
artists from all over Africa, and they brought them all together, put me in the
Roundhouse in North London over a period of two weeks. We’d never met each other before and we had to create a show. After a nightmare two weeks, we had a show in place and we’re
taking it to Africa. So that’s one of the things coming up. BENJI B Is it going to be online or in a video? IG Culture No, the information is online. We’ll see. BENJI B Album-wise, project-wise, label-wise? IG Culture The Zen Badizm project is imminent and I’m doing an album for a label in
Chicago, Deeper Soul, and I’m doing an album under my Quango moniker as well.
I went to Chicago for five weeks and recorded the album, working with a lot of
musicians there like Tortoise, Corey Wilkes and a lot of jazz musicians. That’s the tale of my travels. BENJI B What does IG stand for? IG Culture “Instant Graphics.” BENJI B Where did that one come from? IG Culture There was a young MC I was working with called Kid Co who sadly passed away,
and he used to call me Instant Graphics. So I kept it in memory of Kid Co. BENJI B At this point, it’s time to open up the floor. If there’s any questions you want to ask IG, don’t be shy. I know we’re all going to want to know the answer. Brandon’s got the mic. Audience Member Hey, man. IG CUlture Yo. Audience Member Have you always played keys on your tracks or is it you playing drums? IG Culture It was something I just picked up along the way. I started off by just playing one chord, and then another chord, and then I bought some books to learn a couple of scales and stuff. That’s how I picked it up. Audience Member Was that you playing keys on the earlier tracks, the Herbie Hancock? IG Culture Some synths, but the main guy on those tracks is Kaidi Tatham. Audience Member Yeah, I was thinking about the broken beat scene. I was really into that a few years ago, and I haven’t really gotten much of a clue what’s going on, but I was thinking about, you talked earlier about that the sound has gotten a bit standardized. There’s a basic groove and a lot of people use it. In the beginning, there was always just about the beat being broke. Is there still any upcoming producers or producers that you prefer that are still really trying to progress the sound of broken beat? IG Culture Well, it’s difficult when you’re not 100% focused on it, like if you’re doing that plus your day job, then you’re not going to really just make it out of desperation and do something off the hook just because you’re focused on it completely. There’s a few producers who are kind of doing some things. There’s one guy named Johnny Miller. I like his stuff. Simbad’s doing some stuff. I haven’t really heard a standout producer. There was a kid a few years ago, a guy named Hefner, who was doing some crazy shit, and then he disappeared. He could have been up there. Audience Member At least I recognized the names, so I can check it out. IG Culture OK. Audience Member Thanks. Audience Member Hey, do you think the interest you have in jazz has helped you to keep pushing what you’re doing and not sort of settling in one style or whatever and keep searching for stuff? IG CUlture Yeah, definitely. Yeah, because jazz, you can’t pinpoint it. It’s just always moving all over the place. Yeah. It’s always an influence. Audience Member Hi, my question is, coming from London as well, what kind of made you step away from the crime and the kind of down parts of it and kind of move away from the scene, like grime for instance, what made you... I know that’s probably not in your era before, but what made you kind of get away from all the bad stuff and made you turn into the direction that you went into? IG Culture Because I’m a good heart yout [applause]. I love music more than shit, you know. Most of my friends were into that, but most of them are in jail or ended up in jail, so I wasn’t really into that. I was more into the music. Audience Member My other question is because of the software, basically everyone got access to it, what can you do to kind of stand yourself out from other people and other competitors? IG Culture Just do what everyone else ain’t. It’s just like turning away... Audience Member How? IG Culture By turning away. Everyone’s facing the other direction, you turn and face the other direction. Audience Member Hi, you mentioned Freedom School, and it’s interesting because I know Mark de Clive-Lowe who’s also kind of associated with broken beat heavily in London. Do you think now jazz is connecting with broken beats, is it kind of a good sign for the label, the broken beat, is this where it’s going to evolve into, that kind of Strata East, black jazz sound? IG Culture No, no, that’s just one of the things that broken beat is involved in. I mean, there’s hip-hop connected to it. There’s drum & bass connected to it from Dego, Seiji, and Mark Force and Domu. There’s reggae connected to it. As I said earlier, London was just like a melting pot, a testing ground for so many styles of music and so many styles of American music as well. We just absorbed everything. Audience Member Where do you see broken beat evolving in the future? Do you have an idea of where it’s headed? IG Culture As long as producers just want to make... If they don’t expect that it’s going to make them loads of dollars, if you want to do a big tune, just write a pop tune. Don’t do a broken beat tune if you want to do a pop tune. BENJI B Any more?

Joe Bataan
Growing up in East Harlem in the ’40s and ’50s, Joe Bataan had to learn street smarts. Time spent with the local gang led him to prison and upon release he turned to music, making his first steps into a life-changing direction. He soon formed his first band, blending the local boogaloo and doo-wop sounds. The release of “Gypsy Woman” in 1967 was his first success and lead to more albums and production work. In 1973, he combined salsa and soul and co-founded the Salsoul label, one of the most memorable imprints of the disco era. He left Salsoul later in the decade due to financial disagreements, but not before a chance encounter in a community center led him to record one of the first raps, “Rap-O Clap-O.”
In this lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy, this giant of NYC Latin music recalled his childhood, the first recording sessions and how the boogaloo proved a cultural changer in NYC.
Hosted by Jeff Chang We have with us today one of the giants of Latin music and music from New York City over the last four decades. In fact, this is your 40th anniversary this year of making music, isn’t it? Joe Bataan Thanks for reminding me. Jeff Chang Mr. Joe Bataan has been making pioneering sounds since 1966. He began with the doo-wop soul sound, moved into boogaloo, was a pioneer of salsa and one of the first artists signed to Fania Records, moved on and pioneered the Salsoul Records label, which many of us know, and have their records in our crates to this day. And then he made one of the first rap records. Before “Rapper’s Delight” he made a record called “Rap-O Clap-O.” So please join me in welcoming the legendary Mr. Joe Bataan. Joe Bataan Before I do that, let me explain to everyone here, because a lot of times you come and meet an artist and you don’t know anything about them. I’ve learned to share with my audience, my life, what I do, and how it affects my music.
You might be a fan of my music and not know anything about me. It goes hand in hand. When I thought about coming to Australia, I was talking to my wife, who’s with me, saying, “Wow, we’re going all the way to Australia, another continent. Think we can make the trip?” It was very difficult, and yet when I decided to come here I asked, what do I have to offer? I always ask myself that question. I’m a self-taught musician, but gee, I do have 40 years in the
business and all I can show you is my world experiences and how I was involved in music and the roads it took me down. That can help you only if you’re interested in a career in music and in knowing the pain and the struggle involved in the past. Like anything else, you must know your history, what was
involved then and what’s involved today. They talk about selling records out of the trunk of your car, rap artists do that, I was doing that in the ’60s. I learnt about the business of sales, and getting your records played on the
radio. I went through the whole payola bit and the gangsters who said they wouldn’t play my records. I went full circle like Morris Levy, the same thing Frankie Lymon
went through. I want to share that with you so you know my story wasn’t a fly-by-night thing, that I wanted to do this and I went to school. No, I couldn’t afford to go to school, I did a stint in the reformatory, I did five years for being a bad boy. I was the neighborhood tough kid with aspirations for doing something and, of course, being from New York, you always try to find
short cuts. Being a minority at that time, you had only two ways you could make it in life, either as an entertainer or an athlete. I struck out as an
athlete, I was too short. I couldn’t be a basketball player, I couldn’t reach the rim. Then music came along and saved my life… the universal language, God blessed me and I’m happy that I’m here today to speak to you about it.
Nevertheless, I was very fortunate in being able to accomplish the things I did in such a short time. After being released, I went to the neighborhood, and you have to realize back then our form of entertainment was radio. TV
wasn’t really a hot issue back then. We grew up every morning listening to the hit parade. What played was Patti Page, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, The Four Lads and once in a while we’d get Nat King Cole or Pérez Prado. And that was the extent of my upbringing with music. So, as you can see, my first influences were with white singers. That influenced my style, my diction and how I
pronounce the words. You have to understand when you listen to records, not everybody will understand if you really have to bend your ear. If you’re from
a native tongue, some people muddle their words; it comes from a lot of soul sometimes, and it comes from a way of growing up. All these influences, I found myself actually pronouncing these words. That was important. Jeff Chang This was ’64. Joe Bataan It was ’64, I was looking for a band and prior to that I’d sung in the hallways but nothing serious. I found this group of kids that were at William Ettinger Junior High School in 106th Street. This was way after my gang days. I was a member
of The Dragons; the neighborhood gang, we had rivalries for years with The Viceroys. That was a way of life, we didn’t come to your neighborhood, you
didn’t come into ours. So, despite all these different things you had to fight with this peer pressure, where people didn’t like you because of what you wore, or you were from a different nationality. So, you couldn’t walk down our block
because you were lighter skinned or you were darker, we didn’t like the way you dress. All those things, surviving and trying to make it in life was very difficult. Jeff Chang And the other thing was you’re of Filipino, black, African-American descent, but everyone thought you were Puerto Rican. Joe Bataan Well, that was the whole argument. It didn’t make any difference to me, I grew
up without a prejudiced bone in my body. I went to school with Jewish kids, Japanese kids, that’s just how I grew up, not everyone else. Being from Filipino heritage, my father was from Manila, my mother was black, she was from Newport
News [in Virginia], but here I was in the midst of Spanish Harlem so I had to learn the language. All my friends were Puerto Rican, they spoke it, I spoke it and I blended right in. They would fight you and take you downstairs and chop your head off, if you said I was anything else. That was the argument for years. After people heard my
songs on the radio they’d say, “Yeah, that’s the Latino guy, he’s great. That’s Joe Bataan, he’s my man.” And then a brother would come up and say, “What are you talking about, homeboy? He’s a brother, his mother’s from
Newport.” That argument went on for years. Back and forth, back and forth. “What is he?” I tell everyone I’m universal, I’m rainbow, I’ve got a little bit of everything.
My kids have even more. I married a Puerto Rican so they have Puerto Rican, they have the full spectrum. Jeff Chang But the music you were listening to back then? Joe Bataan I told you, I want you to get that feel of the transition. I was listening to Patti Page and then along came Alan Freed and he introduced rock & roll and
it was something we’d never heard back then. Who’s this kid singing “Why Do Fools Fall In Love” with this high voice like a girl’s? Boys wouldn’t sing
like that, you sang with a lower register. Jeff Chang Like the Michael Jackson of that time. Joe Bataan Exactly. We tried to imitate these groups. Then along came The Limeliters and The Heartbeats and I went back to prison. I violated parole and was sent up there and tried to polish my music while I was up there. I was under the
tutelage of Mark Francis, he was a graduate of the New York Conservatory in Manhattan, which really had nothing to do with me, because he couldn’t get me
to read a lick. When it came to theory I could never, never follow it. There were theory notices, he wouldn’t let you pick up your instrument if you
couldn’t read or didn’t know your theory. Knowing a minor six or a major third was always Greek to me. I finally got out of there and got a band. The group of kids who were in that auditorium then were 11, 12, 13 years old. It was a bit of history, they were the youngest band in Latin music, it was unheard of for a group that young. I was 19, the oldest. When I walked into that
auditorium I stuck a knife into the piano because I was the neighborhood thug. They all knew me, knew my reputation. I said, “I’m the leader of the
band.” They all said, “Yeah, you’re the leader, no problem.”
It’s like a Cinderella story. These kids didn’t know their left foot from their right, didn’t know rhythm or how to dance, they just knew their
instruments. We learnt together as an entity. The singer we had, he had a Spanish accent and at that time the boogaloo was starting to
happen. There’d been success with “Watusi,” “Bang! Bang!” by Joe Cuba, “I Like It Like That,” “Boogaloo Blues,” and he was attempting to do this song in English. We tried to explain to him, “Look, you need to pronounce the words a certain way.” He got upset and said for me to do it my damn self. So, I did and the rest is history, I haven’t stopped singing since. They all said: “Joe, you do the songs.” George Goldner, who was responsible for Roulette Records, said, “You don’t want to sing, you sound too sweet, we need someone like James Brown.” And I’m glad
I didn’t listen to him, because we walked away from him and got a contract with Fania Records and recorded “Gypsy Woman” at Beltone Studios on 33rd
Street. That day is interesting, you’ve got to imagine, here’s this 19-year-old with a bunch of kids, and we had no charts. All the music was inside our head. Every break, every beat was in our heads. The discipline that was needed, I can’t imagine. If I flinch this way [gestures], they knew what that meant. If I said, “Give me two,” they knew. That’s how intense the rehearsals were. You could only do it with that group of youngsters. You couldn’t get a bunch of adults to do that, me telling them: “You’ve got to do this, dance this way.” It
was because those kids were young I was able to do that. When we got into the studio, I don’t know if you know how they record, but you normally do the rhythm section first, then you bring in the horns, then you bring in the strings. Well, we sat there and the recording director was Johnny Pacheco, he said, “Are you ready?” I said,
“Yes.” I sat down and sang every song of that album while playing the piano. That was unheard of, you normally overdub. And everyone else played. They were
so nervous they were going to tell us to leave, and this was our great opportunity, that we finished the whole album in four hours. The guy was amazed, “Don’t you want some more time to come back?”
“No, please sir, please.”
By the ninth song, I started losing my voice and you could hear the raunchiness which I have now, it stayed with me and eventually became a style. Jeff Chang What song was that? Joe Bataan That was on “Ordinary Guy.” I was on my last breath because I didn’t want the guy to throw me out the studio. Jeff Chang Why don’t you play that? Joe Bataan OK, play it. Jeff Chang This is “Ordinary Guy.” Joe Bataan 1966. (music: Joe Bataan – “Ordinary Guy”) Joe Bataan That’s how I like to identify myself, you can always find me talking to my audience at a gig, as you’ll find out if you come tomorrow, that I like to share. I enjoy this business, most people should bring something to the table, there’s no sense of doing it just for the love of money. Forget it, you could
go broke. If you don’t have the proper timing for a hit record, if you don’t know the proper people, you’re going to get ripped off. If you don’t know the business of music, your craft, the business end of this whole magnificent world of music, without it you won’t relish the rewards and you’ll be
sorry. You’ll be crying the blues for another 30 years, wondering what happened to the talent and the financial element you didn’t get. Jeff Chang That’s some truth. Let’s talk about the style and the stylistic changes. You
had “Ordinary Guy.” Actually, I didn’t hear the raunchiness in the voice. Joe Bataan It was there [laughter]. Jeff Chang It was beautiful. The other stuff you guys were working with included boogaloo and the sound that became known as salsa. Tell us about all the other
influences that went in. Joe Bataan “Gypsy Woman,” everyone knows was a Curtis Mayfield song. I turned out to have another style where I could pick songs. I knew songs that had the potential to
be something, even though they were before. I knew songs that I could attempt to do differently so people might get a refreshing ear. That’s what I did with
“Gypsy Woman.” I took the same song, put different music to the same lyrics and we had what we call a cha-cha with a backbeat. It was “Gypsy Woman.” This was one of the first that crossed over into the American charts. (music: Joe Bataan – “Gypsy Woman”) Joe Bataan That was one of my first songs and it really put Joe Bataan on the map. I was really gearing for the Latin community, but it got a big black audience also.
For a long time, you had people who loved Latin music, but they couldn’t understand it. If I said… [says something fast in Spanish], you wouldn’t know what I was talking about. What it did was allow the other masses that normally wouldn’t listen to Latin music, because it was done in Spanish, to listen to this. Some people called it boogaloo, I preferred Latin soul, and that’s probably why I survived those other boogaloo artists, because I had the mindset to change and say I was doing Latin soul and that’s what I’ve been known for 40 years. Jeff Chang You’ve said something very interesting in interviews, which is that boogaloo as a style, whose heyday was pretty much ’66 to ’68, ’69, was actually run off the air, was suppressed. That’s really interesting. People might think kids were dancing to it, but then a new style came along, they did something else. But you said the mambo folk, the mambo kings, the purists suppressed the music. Joe Bataan They chased us off the air. It’s taken 40 years for people to know what happened and if they ever do a movie about it, people will know the truth. The
boogaloo saved Latin music. There were times when a lot of Jews and black people would go out dancing. When the boogaloo came about, it was so tremendous
it was like the twist, people would come and see people dancing, stomping their feet and clapping their hands in harmony, that allowed those purists in
bands that had been playing – like Pérez Prado, Xavier Cugat, Tito Puente - couldn’t follow in the same vein. You probably know this when you play to people, but you can take a black person, who normally has a history of soul and doesn’t listen to
Latin and you attempt to get him to play it, he doesn’t know it. The same thing is true for the Latino who has grown up listening to mambos or the cha-chas, he has no knowledge of the backbeat. So when you put those people in your group, there’s a teaching process. I’ve been able to do it. If you find the purists, they keep to their own people. That doesn’t happen anymore, but it was happening like that for a long time in the business. It was very difficult to find bands who could play both authentically. That means doing on clave and then to really hit it back and do harmony and doo wop or disco. The story goes, back when it came to prom time and they’re having their
graduations, the black kids would say, “We want Kool & The Gang,” and the Latinos would say, “No, we want Tito Puente.” Because they couldn’t agree
they’d get Joe Bataan. I was able to do both, so because of that I’d get a lot of the work. I was fortunate [laughter/applause]. Sometimes it doesn’t work for you. I mean, this business is a tough business. I’ve always been on the outskirts, of almost always making it big time. Maybe it’s a blessing, and I keep missing. Someone wrote in England, “Yeah, he’s an ornery cuss. He’s always fighting with the record producers and the companies.” That’s partly true. The only part that he said, “That I was still pumping gas in East Harlem,” that part wasn’t true. Nevertheless, I did have a lot of arguments, because I felt what’s right and what belongs to me, that comes from my mother. She was 4’9” and she used to fight for me in school, all right, and I believe that if I’m right about something, there’s no damn way in hell that I’m gonna succumb, to sell myself out short of making a dollar. For a long time, Joe didn’t make any dollars, I’m barely making a couple of dollars now, but I’m very wealthy. I’m wealthy because I have my health and strength. I have a family. I got my home that I had, and I’ll tell you that story, and a lot of other things that people who did end their lives successful, are not here any longer. I’m not a youngster. I’m younger than the sun, but I’ve seen a couple of decades. I’ve been through the ’50s, the ’60s, the ’70s, the ’80s, the ’90s, and here I am here today. God has blessed me and I want to bring you the message, so you’ll here that tomorrow. As I said, it was very difficult. I was able to make those transitions because, after that era, when the boogaloo came, I believe it was... Jeff Chang Well actually, can I stop you? Part of what I think is really incredible about your story is that you ended up trying to fight for artists’ rights all the time. You were working with
some of the most – well, you don’t want to speak ill of the dead, or people you don’t know – but some of the most notorious for their deep exploitation of
artists; people like Morris Levy of Roulette Records, the
Tico folks. You didn’t sign with them because you figured out a way to work it. Joe Bataan Let me tell a story. Here I am in New York trying to grab a recording contract and everybody’s trying to get hold of Joe Bataan, everybody’s trying to rip me off silently.
One thing you should know, Bataan is not my real name, it’s my first name; my last name is Nitollano. The Joe came about when I was about to play in a club one day and a business card I had said, “Call Joe Bataan or Carmen,” so a businessman thought that was my name and he started calling me Joe and advertising me all over the place. It sounds great, Joe Bataan, whooh, a new identity, it changed my life. The gangster guy, the guy who was always causing trouble, they didn’t
know he was the same guy. So people came to see me play, they’d say, “I know him, he’s the guy who took my coat in high school.” I’m going to tell you a
funny story, it’s embarrassing now, a guy called me up from a venue in Las Vegas, “Joe, we’d like you to play in Vegas.” “Great, I haven’t played down there.” “I used to know you from up in East Harlem.” “Yeah, what’s your name?” “Winston.” “Yeah, great.” “I remember the old days, you know? You took my coat once, but you gave me back my hat.” I was so embarrassed. Those stories come about, life was a little difficult. Jeff Chang You were talking about the record labels. Joe Bataan The record labels. I was going into Roulette records, which was notorious at the time. If you’ve seen The Frankie Lymon Story, the guy with the big cigar, that was Morris Levy. He was a gangster. I walked in there and I was with José Curbelo, who was a band leader. He said, “Come here son, I’m going to show you how to do this. You know what publishing is? [whispers] I’m
going to get you your publishing.” Morris was sitting there with his big cigar, “Alright, what do you want?” This was when they first had intercoms on the telephones. He said, “Mo, the kid wants to record, but he’s scared.” “What’s he scared about?” “Symphony Sid says he won’t play his records unless he signs with them.” “That faggot” – excuse my language – “get him on the phone right now, put him on the phone.” Phones him up. “Sid?” “Yeah, what do you want, Mo? I’m sleeping.” “You faggot. You told this young kid you won’t play his records because he won’t sign with you?” “What are you talking about?” “I’ve got this kid over here, named Joe Bataan.” He says: “I don’t remember.” “Well, you little fuck. You work for me, you do what I tell you, you hear me?” “Yeah, Mo, yeah.” [Gestures slamming phone down.] Jeff Chang Symphony Sid is the biggest radio
guy in the city. Joe Bataan So, he said, “What else do you want?” So I whisper, “Well, I’d like to get paid for the session?” “You got it. What else do you want?” “Well, what about publishing?” [Shouts] “Publishing! What are you, a wise guy? Who told you about publishing?” “I write songs.” “OK, we’ll talk about that. What else do you want?” “I’d like some money up front.” “Get out of here, get out of here!” Then lo and behold George Goldner walks in, whose responsible for The Chantels
and a lot of big R&B groups and says, “I know this kid, I’ve got him signed to a contract.” “What? Get the hell out of here!” Another guy walks in and says, “I know him, too, I’ve got
him signed!” So he says, “Well, you little wise-ass guy.” Jeff Chang You had three different contracts? Joe Bataan They were trying to rip me off, that was the only way I could protect myself. I signed everything Joe Bataan, that wasn’t my name. I didn’t know anything about the legal side, but I knew one thing. I knew if I signed my name but it wasn’t my name, they didn’t own me. They could kill me, torture me, whatever, but if I found out you were trying to crook me, you didn’t have a binding contract. So that’s what I did, I signed with everybody. They tried to rip me off. They said: “You’re a wise guy,
we’re going to fix your ass. Get out of here, you’re not going to record with no one.” So, I walked out with my tail between my legs. “Gee, I really blew it.” Then someone called me up about a young guy, ex-cop, who was
starting a record label with Johnny Pacheco. “I’m going to send him down to see you, and if he likes you, he’ll give you a record deal.” So he came down,
he was very nervous, probably as nervous as I was. He asked what I wanted. I said, “Publishing.” He didn’t know what it was either. He paid me for the
session and the rest is history. I started making records. It wasn’t the greatest deal, but at that time it was probably the only deal. Jeff Chang What was the name of the label? Joe Bataan Fania Records. Today it’s owned by Emusica, and there’s a resurgence in boogaloo around the world. Records are selling like hot cakes in the market, from the UK all the way down to Italy, you name it. Emusica is part of V2. Jeff Chang You ended up becoming one of Fania’s biggest lights. They had Willie Colon and you and Ray Barretto, and
the three of you were the top sellers consistently. Joe Bataan We were young, fresh and wild, like one of my songs says. We had no inkling about tomorrow, we were living for today. We did everything under the sun and
at that time you’ve got to understand the Vietnam War was going on and there were girls left behind in the neighborhoods, so there was an abundance of sweethearts that we had because everyone was over there fighting. It was just
one of those things with the hippie movement, LSD and all those things came into play. It was a growing experience. I did go behind the Iron Curtain, I don’t
know if you want to go there yet. Jeff Chang Let’s stay with the music. You recorded a song called “Riot” and I want to play that song. Joe Bataan “Riot” is a song by Smokey Robinson. I started getting good when I listened to songs. I’d change the music around and keep the words. Smokey is one of the greatest lyricists the world has ever had, one of the most prolific. When you listen to his lyrics you’ll know what I’m talking about. He did that as a B-side, he never thought he was going to use it. It’s called
“It's A Good Feeling” and when I incorporated the sounds, the conga, the cowbell and everything else, I called it “It’s A Good Feeling (Riot)” This song was so successful in New York in 1968 that it outsold every artist four-to-one. It was my first gold record. We used to play this song and no one could follow us on stage, because of the emotion and high energy it had. I played this song for an hour straight on a boat ride and when we did the conga line, which we’re going to do tomorrow, the boat was rocking. They begged me, the Coast Guard came, because the boat was going [gestures boat rocking side to
side] and we wouldn’t get off stage. The ”Riot“ song had that much energy. If you ever danced to a song you didn’t want to end, that was “Riot”. Jeff Chang Here we go. (music: Joe Bataan - “It’s A Good Feeling (Riot)”) Jeff Chang So, how long were you playing this song on the boat? Joe Bataan We played for an hour straight. When the band really came together it’s like a baseball team or a soccer team, when you get everyone on the same wavelength. The routines we had for dancing, the audience participation, was unheard of at that time in New York. It was the thing to do and I’m just happy I was blessed to do it. Jeff Chang You can hear the emerging sound of salsa. What did that mean to Nuyoricans in New York? Joe Bataan Well, the term hadn’t been coined yet. That was in the ’70s. It had always been around. We called it the mambo, the cha-cha-cha, boogaloo, but salsa, the main name, hadn’t evolved yet until later on, after the Yankee Stadium concert.
“Salsa” means “sauce,” but somebody coined the word and it became a household name. Then everything that followed with Latin connotations was called salsa. Jeff Chang But it was basically a catch-all term? Joe Bataan Yeah, just like rap had to be identified because nobody knew what it was. They would say “Clap your hands,” at first, or “Stomp your feet,” with the first rap songs I heard. No one even had a name for it. I think I was the first with “Rap-O Clap-O,” after that they started naming it. They had rappers, but
nobody put the name to it. Jeff Chang I want to play another record to show how you were developing your sound in this era. Then we’ll come back to the story about East Germany. This is “Nuevo Jala Jala.” (music: Joe Bataan – “Nuevo Jala Jala”) Jeff Chang If I remember right there was a dance back in the ‘60s called Jala Jala. Joe Bataan Right, that was Richie Ray that made it famous. I think he took it from Colombia and brought it back to New York, like a lot of those bandleaders did, like Willie Colon brought the “Che Che Colé,” that was instantly successful in New York. What you see is that a lot of those phases and crazes were brought from other countries and people modernized them and put that to music and something was created again. Just like the clothes keep returning, everything
has a cycle of repeating itself. We’re waiting for Beethoven. Jeff Chang You’re waiting for Beethoven to come back? You might have to bring him back next year. Salsa actually describe a wide range of sounds. Joe Bataan It wasn’t their intention but that’s how it is. If you spoke to someone in Italy and mentioned salsa they’re going to take the full spectrum, but those purists that did it in New York, they only meant their particular music, they meant salsa as their heritage. But it got bigger than them and everyone else. It’s over three-quarters of the world, Latin music. Jeff Chang If you go out and get these records that have been reissued on Fania, like Riot has been
reissued and Saint Latin’s Day Massacre has been reissued, you hear a lot of styles, which was always your thing, of presenting all these kinds of music. Joe Bataan Exactly. Jeff Chang At the same time salsa is becoming the sound of a new generation of Nuyoricans, expressing brown pride and all that kind of thing. So this has led you to do some other work, like going to East Germany with Angela Davis as a representative of that heritage. Joe Bataan I’ve always been a person who didn’t follow the norm. I had played for a Young Workers’ Liberation Party at a dance once, and some of the youngsters
approached me – I guess I was naive at that time politically – and said would I like to go and play in East Berlin. I said, “East Berlin? No one can get
in.” They said, “We’ve got a way to get in, would you come with us?” And they were going to take me on to Moscow, and this was in 1973. And when I found out
I was going with Angela Davis, it was a great opportunity. Of course, I was discouraged from going. They said, “Joe, if you go on this trip you’re going
to be blackballed.” Like in the McCarthy era. I thought, “Wait a minute, that’s not my political views, I just want to play music.” They said, “Yeah,
but you’ve got to be careful, some people are going to follow you.” I said, “Get out of here with that cloak and dagger stuff.” I traveled with these kids who became good friends of mine through the years. There’s no place I can go in the US without having somewhere to stay. These people that I travelled with, that festival was sort of a melting pot like this. This is a great idea what Red Bull is doing, bringing the minds together, it’s so important, don’t lose it. And I’m glad that I did it when I made that trip to East Berlin.
Those people there are still my friends; they tried to educate me, but maybe I was too ignorant at that time because I was a musician first, not a political
activist. But when I got to East Berlin, you’ve got to understand I was going across Checkpoint Charlie and I was with Angela Davis who was notorious at that time, she got locked up, the prison break. A brilliant lady, I had no idea she spoke nine languages, was so well versed in political science, I really got an education in what was going on in the world besides East Harlem. When I made that trip someone remarked about a young lady who was on the run from the FBI, called Assata Shakur. She went to someone’s home looking for refuge and they turned her away, not knowing what party she was, and it turned out to be a question. I said, “Gee, you’re telling me you’re the Young Workers’ Party and talking about women’s rights and these things that have been done to you, why did you turn her away?” They said, “I wasn’t involved in that, I can only go a
certain distance and that doesn’t involve us harboring someone who was wanted by the FBI.” I said, “Would you do that to your friend?” And that was the question. Would you turn someone away for fear of being damaged yourself, even though they might have ideals that are right? So, I was pulled by the same kind of questions, but nevertheless I made the trip. When I got off the plane, I noticed something curious; here I was in a country that most people couldn’t get into. When I went through West Berlin it
was very colorful, just like the United States. But when I went through Checkpoint Charlie everything was drab. There was no red, there was no blue, only grey. And as I walked down the streets, I started to notice the people; everyone was young, there were no old people. Everybody greeted me, everyone was so warm, I couldn’t understand. It was the time of the Afro. I guess the East Berliners hadn’t seen so many blacks, not with Afros. They’d come out and touch my hair, I was signing autographs, man, not because I sing, but because of my Afro. They didn’t have a lot of things, man, they had no ice, refrigerators, modern equipment, which they were closed off to. But they said to me they had signed a law to outlaw racism. I said, “Why?” “Well, after what happened in the war, we thought we’d outlaw that.” This is not at all like I thought it would be. They said, “No, they keep churning the propaganda out there. We want you to come in
here. They don’t want us to go out of here.” I made a lot of friends. I brought Joe Bataan albums and spread them over communist Germany. Jeff Chang You brought Riot out there? Joe Bataan I was stopped at customs, because the Riot album depicts a lot of violence, a gang having fights. The guy at customs said, “Why are you bringing this into
our country? Are you sure you should be giving this out to our people?” The rest is history. We had standing ovations everywhere we went. They were so appreciative of my music and I found that was something that happened throughout my life. Same thing in Moscow when we went there. That was an experience that I hold onto, meeting people from around the world just to see what was going on. Now, we don’t have any great wall any more, but that’s a part of history that I have and I can tell everybody about. Jeff Chang Now, you’re also beginning to have a lot of issues with Jerry Masucci and Fania Records. What were those issues and how did you deal with that? Joe Bataan Well, everyone likes to get paid. I found myself having to change a flat tire in East Harlem and I didn’t have the money to pay for it. “What the hell? Joe Bataan, my ass. I can’t even pay for a flat tire! Who was making the money?” I was so popular, everybody knew me, I was a household name. I said something’s wrong here and I went up and asked for my reviews, and he said, “You’re still in the red for money you
owe us for the recordings.” Things I was ignorant about, which you should know about in the business. After that I read about the Brooklyn Dodgers, they had two pitchers called Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale. And they told the Dodgers to kiss their ass, they weren’t going to pitch for them anymore. I took a
little from them and said, “Kiss my ass, I ain’t making no more records.” He thought I was joking and he made me starve for a year, but he eventually sent
someone out and we settled on something, and I got me a little co-op. Jeff Chang But before this you were talking to the other artists. Joe Bataan Yeah, I was trying to organize a lot of the groups there, a lot of them sold out. I’m sorry to say that. They were satisfied with the crumbs or their
picture on the billboard. I wasn’t, that’s why you’ll never see me in the movie Our Latin Thing because I refused to be on it. Those guys didn’t get paid. To this day a lot of them don’t have benefits. They have no medical insurance, they have nothing. It’s time for people to organize, you youngsters, when you get into the business, make sure there’s something. We’re
in the, what, space age? It’s unheard of. Everybody’s got a union. The musicians have nothing. Even the DJs should organize and get a union for
protection. It’s a shame. It’s like that guy said, I saw him on TV, David Suzuki, he said, “We’ve got a lot of responsibilities, but we go around talking about Paris Hilton, Michael Jackson doing this, or this guy throwing this girl off the window or this guy beating this guy in the bathroom. And we got issues, we got a water problem here in Australia, we got all different things and we don’t pay no attention to it.” Same with music. I know one ingredient David was missed – spiritual, which I believe very strongly has a big part to play in environmental things that are happening today because we’re on a collision
course. Hopefully, you people will come together. There’ll be some of you with ideas about changing the scope of things to be done and bringing people forward. Jeff Chang Thanks for that Joe, thank you.
Joe Bataan After breaking with Fania Records and Jerry Masucci, I’d finally had it. I said, “You’ve got to let me go.” It was sort of the gangster coming into me, I said, “You’ve got to let me go, you hear what I’m saying?” And I guess he knew we weren’t going to hit it off any more, because he was ripping me off and I wasn’t going to make any more records for him. His interests were going nowhere, so finally he gave me my release one day. I’m sure he regretted it, thinking that I wouldn’t be able to do anything. And as I said before, it’s a lonely feeling once you’ve left. Once you leave high school, you’ve got to go someplace else, you start thinking about that next institution you’re going to. You’ve been used to your friends for four years; I was used to the label, now I’m looking and I’m searching. If you’re searching, like my teacher said
some time ago, by the time you’re 30 you better know what you’re doing for the rest of your life. Music is the same thing. If you’re going to pursue it, you better damn well know what you’re doing by that age, you can’t keep waiting and waiting and waiting for something to fall off the ceiling. He let me go, and I did some research. There was a little label called Mericana Records, they did pantyhose and selling things down in Florida to the mafia, I don’t know. Jeff Chang There was a record label that did pantyhose? Joe Bataan Yeah. Don’t ask me why [laughs]. I’ll tell you, there’s so many stories. They were just involved in anything that made money and the record label was
just a side thing. When the pantyhose was bad they’d try to sell some records. So I walked in and saw the guy. “Yeah, what do you want?” “Well, I’d like to
make records for you, this is what I think I can do.” Similar to what happened with Fania. He said, “OK, I’ll take a chance.” And he gave me a few grand and
I went in and recorded this album. Of course, they had no idea of how to promote an album, what to do, where to go. I said, “I’ll take care of that end.” And there I was again, at the forefront of this music business. I had to promote that record, and I got it played on the radio. That’s not an easy
thing to do, to get a record played on the radio. First of all, you’ve got to get an appointment and if you’re an artist they don’t want to see you. There’s always the risk of payola. “Why are you coming up here? Don’t you have a
person to bring that record up?” There’s a load of things you’ve got to learn at that end of the business. Finally, I got them the record and I didn’t know
that Frankie Crocker would play the whole album, which he did. He played the whole album, and I think at that time I sold about 15,000 records, which was unheard of back then. They were so excited, the record company, they said, “Let’s finish the album.” That’s when I had them. I was able to ask for the money I felt I was entitled to, and I got it. I gradually grew there and I told them I wanted to start my own production, I wanted to work for the record company. Similar to what I’m going to propose to Red Bull. That was a joke!
Anyway, he finally bit and I signed to that label. He said, “What do you want to call the label?”, I said, “Salsoul Records.” He said, “Why do you want to call it that?” “‘Sal’ meaning salsa, ‘soul’ meaning soul. And the
combination of the two is going to grow into something bigger than you’ve ever known.” He said, “What do you mean?” “It’s going to be the Salsoul of Motown, it’s going to be similar to Motown but its own genre. It’s going to be Salsoul.” He said, “OK.” That first album did so well that I recorded with
some of the great studio musicians of the world, Cornell Dupree, Jon Faddis, the Brecker Brothers, we had Richard Tee and, lo and behold, we had Marty Sheller who did “Watermelon Man”. I did all these songs for the album and I had one particular song that a friend of mine, Gil Scott-Heron recorded called “The Bottle.” He had sung it and he had a problem because he didn’t have the finances to release the product. I sort of knew that and I said, “I won’t
touch the record or try to emulate what he did singing because he did such a terrific job, but I will attempt to do it instrumentally.” This is another
phase of the business I was learning to get good at. I had Marty write the arrangements, I showed him what I wanted. As we went into the studio... Jeff Chang Who was the arranger again? Joe Bataan Marty Sheller, who’s responsible for “Watermelon Man.” We went into the studio, I believe it was at CBS Studios, and as I said before, normally the
rhythm comes, then the brass, then the strings. But everybody showed up at the same time - unheard of! - and it was three o’clock in the afternoon, I had a bunch of people just like this living room here today, and I said, “God, what am I going to do, everybody’s here?” And they all looked at me, “Joe, what do you want to do? We’ve all got things to do.” These guys charge by the hour. I said: “Do you
want a hit record?” “Yes!” “Well, let's do this!” Oh, shit, how do you attempt to place all these guys for one session. But the engineer said he could do it. So he set up everybody, they’re all looking at me. Then this little white guy, he’s
supposed to be playing lead on the saxophone. I looked at him, and said, “Who’s this, Marty?” “That’s the guy I told you about. He can blow his ass
off.” The kid sat over there. He warmed up his horn and we got ready to start the song. What happened that day has never happened in my life since. We did that song in one take. After it was completed there was total silence, the seats were on fire, the horns were smoking. This kid turned out to be David Sanborn. We knew we had something here in “The Bottle,” which we named “La
Botella” – that first week when we played it went on to sell 80,000 records. That was top 40 nationally and the rest was history. He’s had a fabulous
career since then, David Sanborn. (music: Joe Bataan – “The Bottle (La Botellita)”) Joe Bataan I don’t know if you caught it, but you can see there are parts of my life where I was able to change. This is important with anybody in any business, you can
get outdated if you don’t stay in touch. I still go out to clubs to see who’s dancing, because if they’re not dancing to it, it doesn’t make any difference. You might like it, I’m the last judge of my own music and there’s always a testing ground, like DJs testing on the crowds when they come into their clubs. I do the same. Jeff Chang One of the interesting things is when you were trying to reinvent yourself, this is now the mid-70s, right? And you... JOE BATAAN Wow. You’re probably wondering how old I am. Come tomorrow, and I will expose that… Jeff Chang He’s about 25 right now; experiencing his 40th anniversary, and he’s 25. The whole way that you switched up in the mid-80s, or mid-70s excuse me, is very interesting. JOE BATAAN Yeah, I had to. Jeff Chang You told me yesterday you were listening to a lot of Philadelphia International Records, Gamble and Huff and that kind of thing, and that when you sat down with the folks at Mericana you were saying, “I can be your A&R person, and this is what I would do. I would bring in Cornell Dupree. “I would bring in Jimmy Young, Jon Faddis, Richard Titus,” all these folks to bring in, and yet you would also add on to it your own kind of flavor. JOE BATAAN Right, the Latin flavor, which is the conga and the timbales, which it had been done before, but nobody coined it. The Temptations were doing it. They used the conga in, I forget them songs ... Jeff Chang “Message To A Black Man” and stuff like that, yeah. JOE BATAAN Right. They were doing that all the time, and when I noticed it I said, “Wow, check that out. It’s some Latin there. People are not even really identifying it, but it’s there. Dennis Coffey, a lot of the guys. Ah yeah, and I did do that. The Philly sound was very instrumental in Salsoul, without a doubt. After a while, they eventually used the same guys. What they did to embellish it was to bring in Latin percussion. Of course if you had a good song, that only could help. Jeff Chang The sound of disco really is interesting because I think the Latin influence in disco is always kind of understated. JOE BATAAN Back then, you gotta understand, I’m growing up. I’m getting older. I’m going through different phases, and you gotta try to work, right? If somebody tells you, “This shit, there’s not work for your band.” Everybody was doing tracks, so I got out there and got my tracks. Traveled to Germany. I went to Italy, everybody, and I was singing disco. I was able to survive, while other groups, that still had their bands, just stayed dormant. They either broke up, they couldn’t follow the disco trend, or they didn’t want it. That’s why a lot of them hate the disco. That’s why they hated the boogaloo. You always had haters in every type of music. They hated the twist, but it’s there. It’s gonna be there. You gotta know how to get through that wave of influence, and keep going on and hold whatever you have together. Jeff Chang Can we play some of the other Salsoul music that you made? JOE BATAAN Sure! Jeff Chang Yeah? OK. This is one of my favorites, this is “Latin Strut,” and we can talk a little bit about the history of this afterwards. JOE BATAAN Yeah. Okay. Jeff Chang That was from that first record that you had done for Salsoul, called Salsoul. (music: Joe Bataan – “Latin Strut”) JOE BATAAN Latin Strut actually was Deodato song, and it was called “Soul Strut,” but because I was in the Latin market, I changed the name to “Latin Strut.” Of course he still had credit, I put his name there and everything, but that’s what that did. It got a resurgence after the UK picked it up on Soul Jazz, and they started playing on their compilations. So you never know. I think somebody wrote in England, he says, “You know Joe Bataan had no idea what he was doing when he coined the term ‘Salsoul’.” It’s true. I was a young kid, and I say, “Salsoul,” never knowing today I would be talking about it 40 years later, about my music. Sometimes, some of the things that I visualized and felt when I was writing songs, cause sometimes I cry… I’m a very romantic person when it comes to my songs, and I start to think about all the effort and the things that I went through to put that song together, I said, “Nobody’s gonna understand.” Then here it is 40 years later, somebody writes something about a song that was obscure. He says, “Look what this guy wrote back then. What the heck was he thinking about?” Then you start to see, “Man, you mean really, I’m gonna get appreciated?” Because nobody said nothing for 40 years. Then here somebody writes something, and it’s worth the wait. It’s worth the wait, you know? Jeff Chang That’s wonderful. You were always keeping you ear to the ground. All the new sounds that were coming out. I wanted to play two more tracks, actually. First, just play this one, and then there’s a little bit of a lead up to the next 1 that I want to play, but this was “Aftershower Funk,” which… JOE BATAAN Let me ask you something. Jeff Chang Oh, OK. JOE BATAAN Do you have any slow songs? Do you have “My Cloud”? Jeff Chang I bet you I do. Let’s see… JOE BATAAN The reason why I mentioned that is, in New York, I’m notoriously renowned for my ballots, but every place else that I go, I never get a chance to sing those romantic songs. There was a time that people used to ask for my phone book, because all the girls would be lining up there for these songs that I used to sing slow. Nobody ever asks me about the slow, only New York and California, when I do the oldies’ show. You gotta understand, that when I play with my band, I have different avenues that I can go. I can play pure Latin all night for you, or I can do Latin Soul, or I can do the thing where they do with the groups with harmony, four-part harmony and the groups singing like R&B. Sometimes I get called to those shows. Where I don’t bring a band, they have a band already. We go there and we play with The Moments, The Stairsteps, you name it, jazz bands, all those big groups. It’s amazing how I’m able to step into to different areas and meet different people. I guess that’s what’s endeared me to a lot of people, especially the underground. Jeff Chang That’s actually a really important point to make, because in the dances that you’re playing, they don’t just want to dance, they want to slow dance too. Joe Bataan I would hope so. Jeff Chang … with your partner and that kind of thing. Joe Bataan How do you know? How do you know? Jeff Chang Oh I don’t know, I’ve never experienced any of that kind of stuff. I found it. I found “My Cloud” so you hear this? Joe Bataan But you know that I’m married, right? So I can’t dance with you. We’ll do it later on… Here’s “My Cloud.” (music: Joe Bataan – “My Cloud”) Joe Bataan Thank you. Jeff Chang You had taken a big break actually between 1975, 1976 or so and 1980. You, actually… Joe Bataan I made it to 1979 that’s when “Rap-O Clap-O” came out. Jeff Chang Let’s talk about that, because Salsoul took off, but it ended up taking off without you in a way. Joe Bataan Yeah, it left me in the dust once again. We had our arguments, I couldn’t get along. I think I had some vices, I used to like to gamble. I guess it didn’t go hand in hand with what happening. Living the fast life, this business can be cruel. One day I went to get my check and there was no check. I guess they said they didn’t need my services anymore and I didn’t have any type of agreement that would have binded them and I was in the street again. Of course, having my pride, I would never go back to beg for anything so I just went about my way. If I would have known then what I know today, that there was help always for me, it might have been a little easier. I guess you learn by trial and error. I went along and started to raise my family. Actually, we were involved with karate a lot. All my kids are black belts. My wife also. I carried the bags for 11 years. Actually, I wanted to join. Every time I went to join, one of the family members jumped in front of me. The last one was my wife. She said, “No, I want to do this!” Finally, I ended up carrying the bags. I knew everything about karate, I knew how to speak Japanese, the whole doggone shebang. People thought I was a grand master when we would go to the tournaments. They always be bowing to me. “Oh, sensei!” They wouldn’t know that I didn’t know the first thing… It was one of my dreams to get the kids into the Olympics. We studied Shotokan. Wouldn’t you know it - that particular year, after 11 years - when the Olympics came along, it was Taekwondo. So, we didn’t even qualify. Eleven years went down the drain, everybody was mad at me. Jeff Chang Before that though, with the Salsoul thing ... You had a quarter, I understand, you had a quarter of the Salsoul ownership… Joe Bataan Yes. Jeff Chang At one point. Joe Bataan What had happened was, I made an agreement with Salsoul, I was getting up there with popularity. I said I wanted to start my own label. He said, “Well, what are you thinking of doing?” I said, “Well, I got a name called Salsoul that I want to incorporate and start.” They said, “OK, fine.” They would have did whatever I told them to after the success I had with “The Bottle” and everything else that was happening... When they started to get the notion that there was something advantageous to owning part of this name, they sort of convinced me, for a few dollars, that they should be partners with me in this label. Of course it was divided between three brothers; the Cayre,
brothers and Joe Bataan. Actually, after that – and I’ve done this a lot in my life, not proud of it – I always found myself selling whatever I created. Always with the notion in my mind that I could always do it again. That’s very dangerous. In life you probably can, but faith might not have it that way. You might possess the talent to do something continuously, but your lifestyle and what you do might not allow you to do it. That’s what I didn’t figure on. It’s like I have a closet full of Joe Bataan records ... I gave all my records away. To people that came to the house. “Hey, can I get one?” “Yeah!” Never thinking that the closet would be bare today. I can’t even get my own records. I got people that bring my records to me, collectors and stuff. They say, “Hey Joe, here’s a copy.” “Oh, thank you.” That’s how I got my collections. I gave everything away! There was no difference with the label. When that happened, I had no idea that it was going to develop into the monster – yes, I did. But, never going to the point of financial end. So, I didn’t follow my dream fully, and I left her. I said I’ll do it again and I’ll start again. Actually, I did start another label called Ghetto Records, and that’s starting to come out now. Jeff Chang The flipside of it is that you ended up working with young people again - Joe Bataan Yes! Jeff Chang In Harlem, in the late 70s, you started hearing new stuff. Joe Bataan I worked in a community center in Harlem, right in the midst of 110th Street and it was called Hell’s Kitchen, and it was hell down there. Everyone sat down on the stoop outside that center and you’d have to sweep the people away too. Everybody hung out there with hangovers from the night before, or shootings. Everything you might expect in a neighborhood like that. One day
while opening up, someone wanted to rent the place, bunch of young kids. That night I stood at the door collecting the money, all these young kids come in, setting up with turntables, this was 1978, ’79, and I looked – there was ten people on the dancefloor and the next thing you know, it’s packed. I said, “What the hell’s going on here? I don’t see no band playing.” Someone said, “They don’t have no name for it.” And you could hear [makes shuffling
noise] their feet shuffling on the floor and it was a sound where you knew something was really going to transpire. Then in the middle of the record
everybody’s clapping, someone’s talking on the mic. I said, “What the hell’s that shit? How much did they pay to get in?” One dollar. There was a thousand
kids in there. I thought, “Let’s see if this is just a fad.” Someone said, “They do it all the time.” “All the time? Is this on records?” “No.” I had a brainstorm. “Whoa, this isn’t out on records, I see something big.” So, I was not the creator of rap, but I talked to these guys, the guys were Jeckyll &
Hyde. One became CEO at Motown. Jeff Chang A boy named Andre Harrell. Joe Bataan Right, right. I spoke to them and said, “How would you like to put this on records?” They said, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” I guess, they didn’t believe who I was, they didn’t care. I hadn’t done anything for a while, they thought I was full of shit, but I went out and borrowed some money, got RCA Studios, got everybody ready. At that time they weren’t thinking about using musicians for rap songs, I got these four guys. I put down the music and had everything done. There was a young lady named Jocelyn Shaw, who you might know as Jocelyn Brown, lives in the UK now, tremendous singer. Gordon Edwards said: “Do you want a singer who sings like I play the bass?” He brought her, just another David Sanborn, and she sang her ass off. She sang on one of my records. She did the background and I had the chills. “Clap your hands everybody.” “What have we got here?” I waited and I waited three hours and nobody showed up to the studio. Jeff Chang Jekyll & Hyde were supposed to come and record? Andre Harrell didn’t show up? Joe Bataan None of them. I guess they thought I was bullshitting them. I’d spent all this money, how was I going to pay these guys, how was I going to pay the studio? It was RCA. Luckily, I had a little line of credit. So I thought about Jocko Henderson – if you don’t know, he’s a DJ back in the ’50s and he used to talk on the mic, similar to Frankie Crocker. He would say smart things like, “Whoo whappa-do, how do you do?” And I started thinking I could do this myself. I test silently in the back, I didn’t want nobody to see, maybe I’m too old. I was about 39, a 39-year-old rapper. I was hiding in the toilet. I tried it with
all kinds of methods, and then when the music played I just sort of walked through it. It was like it was made to order. When I got out there, I was really gun-shy. The girls started clapping, I tried that. Then I did the song, “There’s a new thing out.” Boom! The rest is history. I took that around to all the record companies. They all threw me out. “Get the hell out of here, Joe, you don’t sing any more?” I said, “This is something new, you’ve got to listen to this.” “Don’t give us that shit.” Then I took it to a guy named Luigi at Prelude, I believe, and there was a young kid in the back and Luigi said, “What have you got here?” I told him it was something new. He said, “OK, I’ve got to get this guy here. He listens to everything we do and we listen to what he says.” “I don’t want no young kid telling me about my music.” He said: “Then it’s not going to happen because we all listen to him.” Turned out to be Larry Levan from the Paradise Garage. Still nobody for music like Larry, to this day. Larry came out and we played the record and he started jumping up in the air like this [moves hands up and down very fast]. I said: “Holy shit!” And he’s smiling at me. I thought this might be good for me. The guy said: “What do you want?” I said: “I want an advance.” “We don’t do advances.” “Goodbye.” I started walking down the stairs, Larry came after me, “Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go. Bring it to my club, let me play it in my club.” “Fuck those guys, man, they don’t know about music. I’m trying to show them something new and they don’t even have the insight to see it. Hell with them, they don’t want to pay no money.” So, I kept going and met a girl named Denice, and she was working with Salsoul. I was still in touch, even though I wasn’t with them
anymore and she said, “You’ve got to let Kenny hear this. He’ll be raving about it, this is great.” I said, “No, me and Kenny don’t get on.” “Look, I’ve
talked to him, I’ve told him that you’ve got something great.” And the word started filtering around the industry, Joe Bataan has something once again. One DJ summed it up, “This guy comes around every two or three years with something new, and we’ve got to listen because he’s always bringing us
something.” So Kenny said, “What do you want?” “I want to release this.” “I’ll put it out tomorrow.” I didn’t know he had a distribution deal with RCA – he could do that. I didn’t have no money. I thought I better not end up losing this because everybody’s going into get wind of this new stuff, everybody’s
going to be doing it soon. Sugarhill Gang already beat me out. Fatback Band beat me out. Jeff Chang Actually, Sugarhill came out after yours. Joe Bataan No, they came out first. It looks like that because I had the big hit in Europe and we were following each other, doing back to back tours, and they
had it on first but New York wouldn’t play me. Rap was taboo at that time. He said OK, and finally we agreed. The brainstorm I had is that when I signed the contract I put a small notation in the bottom which he didn’t read. I finally
got back at him. It said, “This record is only released for domestic purposes.” If it’s being played internationally, they must seek my permission.
The record started selling like hot cakes. Larry Levan was playing it, he sold 20,000 copies the first week through playing it in a disco – not radio, a disco. It was unheard of. People didn’t know that discos could sell records. This was a novelty back then, but they all know it now. What kind of club could generate this amount of sales? That was Larry Levan and the Garage. He released a record, and of course RCA had no idea what they had, they sent it around the world. Glen LaRusso and Saul Whitman called me up. “Joe, they want you to go to Holland. That record is a hit.” “How the hell can the record be a hit? It’s
only been there a week.” “Believe me, I know the business. If Holland says something, so goes Europe.” “A little country like that. What do they know?” “Joe, they want you to fly over.” “Get out of here. For what?” “To do TV.” I’ve got no home, I had no money, I was struggling for money, I’d lost my paycheck from Salsoul. I went down and bought myself a black t-shirt, similar
to this and I put a disco model of a girl dancing on roller skates, cost me $3. Then I got a gold star which cost 50 cents and a fake diamond and I pasted on a $1.50 pair of red suspenders. I put those suspenders on and I went to Holland. They said, “Joe Bataan, Joe Bataan next.” I was ready to go on stage and I realized I forgot my shoes in my hotel room.
“No, I didn’t do that, I didn’t do that!”
I looked around. What do you do? All these kids are jumping up and down waiting for me because the record’s a novelty, they didn’t know about rap. I found this old pair of track shoes, I put them on and went on stage. It
became the rage of Europe, I found kids all over Europe imitating that dress code. Everywhere I went it was “Rap-O Clap-O.” I was signing autographs in every country, from Luxembourg to Belgium to France. In Belgium it was No 1, Holland it was No 2, France was No 3. And the sorry part was I’ve been trying to get to the UK for 40 years, and they keep keeping me out of there. The UK people said, “What are you talking about, Joe?” Let me tell you a story. “Rap-O Clap-O” was selling in the millions, I never got home. I stayed in Europe for six months going from country to country selling records. No pay, but never knowing the money I was generating, because you see
in Europe, as opposed to America, the residuals are seven times that which you’d make in the States, especially if you owned the publishing. They would
literally kiss your ass if you own the publishing to a big record. You could retire. I lived off “Rap-O Clap-O” for 10 years, still living off it. It’s
the biggest record I ever made and it’s one of the records I’m not known for. So, “Rap-O Clap-O” is going on and then here it was… the UK really could have put us over the map. They were playing the record across the DJs, they don’t want to hear nothing, if it’s something that they like, they’re going to play it. But, to get it played on the air, I had difficulty. I didn’t know the politics at that time. Someone in England, I don’t know who it was, got word back - if he gives up half of the publishing, we will play his song. Of course you know that I told them to shove it. The record was never played to full potential that it could have. Joe Bataan could have been a household name by now. Of course, as you see, all through my life I kept missing. I kept missing. Everywhere I went I was second in this. When I threw a concert at Shea Stadium, I was second to that. They just happened to go to the moon that day and the whole stadium was rained on… So, here it is… 40 years later, I’m set to go to the UK. I’m going to the - What the name of that club in England? Jazz Café. So, they got me settled, it’s on the Internet. Everybody says, “Joe Bataan’s coming!” I’m sorry to say, they wouldn’t pay me the money that I requested. Not a lot of money. Nothing in the Madonna scale. It was very cheap, I’m sorry to say. Joe Bataan didn’t go. Once again, I told them, I said, “Let me tell you something – I’m not going to the UK to whore myself to satisfy you, because you’re gonna sell a few tickets and you’re gonna make some money on me coming there.” I said, “I’ll wait.” I said, “Eventually, I will be in the UK.” When I thought about coming to Australia, I know my next step is the UK. With God’s blessing, tomorrow when you come there, we’re going to make history. If you do come, you will see what I’m talking about. Eventually I will get to the UK. Those purists, I will tell them, “Kiss my ass,” and I’m finally going to play the music that I want to play for those people over there that do love my music. That’s just a little part of my story. Jeff Chang Why don’t we play “Rap-O Clap-O” and then take questions from the audience? Joe Bataan Sure. Jeff Chang One thing I did want to say is, you did come back and make an album in 2005, a great record called Call My Name. Actually, do you want to talk about that before? Joe Bataan Let me just skip back a little. Eight years ago Joe Bataan died. I literally physically died. Let me tell you what happened. I was working my job, I’m a tour commander in a prison. See how funny life is? The same place I was locked up as a kid, I’m in charge of running now. I give back to the kids that get into
trouble and I tell them my story and it gives them some feeling that there’s a possibility they can get out of the rut that they’re in, similar to what I
did. I’ve been doing that for 25 years, I’m getting ready to retire next year. I was there working the night shift and I started feeling something in my
head. You know that feeling you get in your body when something changes? And I started twitching. What the hell is this? I guess it was tension. I went down to the infirmary and I told the guy, “Hey, take my pressure.” He said, “Joe, your pressure is 190 over 110. You know what to do? Go upstairs, turn the lights out and start rubbing your neck.” The guys, when I told them, started
laughing. “What kind of damned diagnosis is that? You’ve got to go to the damn hospital.” I didn’t listen. You know how you are when you first start taking
medicine. I was taking medicine for blood pressure and sat back, turned the lights off, and started rubbing my neck. Made it through to the morning, got up, I’d just got paid. I carry a bag all the time and my whole life is in that little bag. Right now, I’ve got it in my hotel room with my wife guarding it.
But anyway, I called my wife up and said, “Let’s go and see Star Wars.” Just
like a kid, I wanted to be one of the first in the neighborhood to see the movie, so I could tell everybody about it. We went to see Star Wars and I started buying the popcorn, the franks, soda, lemonade, everything. The movie is on first thing in the morning. We got there about seven o'clock, it started at nine o'clock, it’s about 11 o'clock now. I approached the car, started it up, grabbed the wheel, rolled my window down. I reached into the back seat to make sure my bag was there, because it had my pay, I just got paid. Everything was intact, except I started bleeding out of my mouth. Now, you might bleed
sometimes but this blood, this was different, it was flowing in abundance and I started getting dizzy, and everything was going blurred. I spat the blood out
of the window and I reached for my bag. Shows you how life is, you love material things. I reached for the bag, here I am about to die and I’m looking
back for my paycheck. I got back some sort of sense and my wife was having a conversation with my daughter and I started choking her [gestures throttling action], literally choking her. She didn’t know what the hell was going on. When I analyze it now, I was mad because she didn’t know what was going on, that I was about to die. I had no control over it, if it ever happens to you,
you’ll know what I mean. I was choking her and she got out of the car to get help. I jumped out and started banging the hood. Boom! Security guard came, I punched him, took 12 people to restrain me. The rest is what I’ve been told. I woke up in a hospital 10 hours later, unconscious… What are the chances of your whole family being called to your bedside? Because while I was in the bed, in a coma - I had one of those tubes they put down you - my wife, my daughter, my grandkids were all around the bed. And this is what I like to say happened, I do use this in my testimony when I play every time I perform. A hand reached down while I was drowning in my subconscious and said, “Joe, you keep running away from me. I gave you so much talent but you’ve done nothing with it, you haven’t helped anybody. I want you to stop running away from me and do my work.” The hand pulled me up and back into life and I opened my eyes and saw my family, but I couldn’t talk. If you ever get on that bed, you’d better pray for a pencil and paper so you can say, “Get that damn tube out of my throat so
I can talk.” And my daughter said, “He’s trying to say something, he’s trying to say something.” And I wrote, “Get the tube out of my throat.” They finally got it out. Whoosh! [gestures pulling tube out] “What the hell’s going on
here?” Everybody kept quiet but they wanted to tell me I had had the last rites, I had a brain tumor. I don’t know what went on, but I have the shirt with all the blood over it and I keep it in my car to remind me, if I ever get too big for my britches, what the real meaning of life is, that I’m here on borrowed time to do something. I’m secondary, I’m nobody. The Lord is my master, he’s teaching me, he’s guiding me and he allowed me to come to Australia to talk to you. If you have someone you love and you haven’t told recently, call that someone and tell them you love them, whether it’s a grandmother, a little kid, even a little dog. Nothing’s promised, we don’t
have to be here tomorrow, as you know from the tragedies you’ve had here in Australia. So, I’ve been dedicated to that in regards of what I do with my
music. I’m trying to let people know about the goodness in life and what we can do to build a world that is pleasant and peaceful. So, I thank god that I’m here. [Applause] Jeff Chang Thank you, Joe. Some music and then questions? Let’s play “Rap-O Clap-O.” (music: Joe Bataan – “Rap-O
Clap-O”) Jeff Chang [To audience] This is your time now… Audience member [Inaudible – asks Bataan to play] Jo Bataan Now, you have to remember that I had no musical training. Everything I did was by the seat of my pants or what I saw other people do. I was very good at watching people. [Playing the electric piano] First three chords I ever learned on this were C, C minor and E minor. And I was able to find out a little secret about myself because I didn’t have all the other tools to work, so what do you do? I
loved the piano but we couldn’t afford a piano when I was a kid. I couldn’t afford music lessons. I learned how to sing, but mostly by ear, and when I learned those three chords I wrote my first song. When people started coming into the audience to listen to what I was doing I thought, “Maybe I really
have something here.” What I recommend is, anybody that writes, learn an instrument. It really helps you and I guess it took me in another direction
because I was handicapped by the only three chords that I knew. I had to embellish upon it and do things that were not conventional, things that other people do. When you write a song you always have A, A, then you have the bridge and revert back to A. So I tried to start a song in B, start with the bridge, and when I learnt about modulation and I found a lot of people weren’t using it. I had to find out how to do that on the piano so I could go into another key, because I knew that would broaden life. And when I finally found out the difference between minor and major, about being sad and happy, that brought another element into my writing. I’m still learning. After a while I got so good I was able to take short cuts. There was a time in my life when I was broke and I didn’t have a piano and I still had to write. I had a contract to do an album. “How the hell do you write if you don’t have an instrument?” And God blessed me, because what I did was put on the radio, and I actually listened to the radio and all the songs that they played, and I took excerpts from them and placed them in my mind. Finally, when the piano came along, I
was able to translate that into the music. The first way I learnt how to sing is that I read a newspaper. This is great training, I don’t know if anybody does that. If you notice some of my songs, I have a habit of saying too many words.
Instead of saying “Baby, I love you,” I say, “Whaa, whaa, whaa, whaa, baby I love you,” and put too many words in there. But it takes training to do that, I didn’t know I was developing a style, so what I did was I’d read a newspaper and challenge myself. Whatever was in that paper I would sing. So there was probably a war somewhere, or an uprising, and I would sing about it and play these three chords.[Plays piano and sings] “There’s an uprising and I don’t
know what to do / But darling I love you.” And I would do things like that and then I’d say, “Well, gee, I keep playing the same song,” so I would change it
around and I’d play it fast. [Plays faster and sings] “Can’t you feel it, can’t you feel it?” And then I’d start getting into the cha-cha vein and I could change the rhythm of songs. I found out whatever I did slow I could do fast, and that became a style of mine. One song I wrote recently, maybe in the ’90s was “The Good Old Days”. We wrote it in the car before I had a piano and we didn’t know how it was going to sound, but we’d open up with it some time and it would go like this… Joe Bataan I really enjoyed that. Jeff Chang Joe Bataan. Joe Bataan So, as you can see, that was a growing up experience that I wanted to share with that. If you come tomorrow, you will see how a lot of the songs I incorporated that way. I’m just so blessed by the Lord and finally realizing it in my old age is what’s making me enjoy this so much more. You have no idea that you could really become alive again. See there’s no reason for me to be here. I’m 64 years old and I feel like a kid. I do all the things that the kids do, all the things that you do. Try to do my exercise, the best that I can do. Ride my bike. I play ball. I got a hell of a jump shot. I do these things and now I got the opportunity to play my music, which I love so much. This is not an accident. I’m here because he sent me. Got a question? Audience member Yes. I was saying how amazing you really are. Joe Bataan Thank you. Audience member Just wondering if you ever license some of your music to film or television? If you could share some of the business side of it… Joe Bataan Sure, OK. The first thing, there’s a book called The Business of Music. Get it. By Clive Davis. I think they have several editions since then. He goes through the spectrum of things you’re supposed to know as far as your publishing, contract, signings, when you need to get an attorney. All those things that you do know. The merchandising part of it is also mentioned in there. I know that book was what guided me and that was some time ago. I know there’s probably better editions now, but you do need to read up on the business that you’re going to get involved in whether it’s film or whatever. I recently did a little part in Liberty Kid. That’s going to be released. They’re going to use some of my music from what I gather and I guess we have to go through the ropes. There’s a law called rear view window law. If I can put it into effect. I have all the product, all the songs that Joe Bataan ever did are going to come back to me. As far as I’m concerned, I’m a rebel. All those songs belong to me. Come and get me. All right. I’ll re-release them if I have to. They said, “Wow, you can’t do that.” What do you mean I can’t? Take me to court and I’ll get you for copyright infringement. You know that after a 28- year period, you’re supposed to put in your agreement with the copyright office so that those songs will come back to you. Well, I didn’t, but also in my contract there’s a clause for hire. If that’s in there then that’s all they had. They don’t really own me. You see? All that stuff belongs to me. They’re not going to fight me. They’re not going to come looking for Joe Bataan. But I got to look at it spiritually also. I’m blessed. Most of the guys who did what I’m doing are not here any more. I’m still here to carry on a legacy and to teach people about what happened to us. Before me there were others. Read and wrote. Before them there were others then. I think it’s only until recently that a lot of the artists are getting paid. Believe it. It’s a lot of the rap artists. A lot of the people singing up there today. They’re getting paid. They don’t blow up the studio, but they’re getting paid. I’m getting paid. I’ve done a lot of deals. I mean I hope I get paid. I’m getting paid. People are not doing what they did years ago. You’ll find that the big companies don’t have time to teach you. If they have to go public, they have to answer to a lot of people. So you’re better off with a large company, I would say. Unless you independently try to get into a company that you control yourself. Open up a publishing company. The first thing you should do… It’s not that difficult. Find out how. Copyright your songs, your ideas. Mail it to yourself, don’t open up the envelope. It’s legal. Get an attorney. Get on the internet. I never had an internet to find information. You have a world at your feet. There’s no reason for anybody to be ignorant about the music business. The hustle part, that has to be learned on your own. If you have the gumption you got to keep yourself in shape. I believe if you have these three ingredients you’ll meet success. That spirit. You must believe in something that’s going to guide you. You must take care of your body, your health everyday so that you’ll have the energy to do what you want to do. And knowledge. Do not let one day go by that you do not learn a new word or a new something. Do not waste your time idly with not learning something every day. It’s only going to enhance the other two and they work together to hopefully let you get what you want to achieve. Yes? Audience member Is the microphone on? You said your kids were experts in karate. Joe Bataan I didn’t say they were experts. I said they took it. That’s the difference. I tried to be humble. Audience member Did you ever teach them music? Or did they ever express any interest in learning? Joe Bataan It’s like anything else and you’ll find it. Are you a parent? Audience member
No. Joe Bataan Okay, you don’t have any kids. Let me tell you. Take your time before you get married. Make sure you know what you’re doing and what you’re getting into. We have too many kids raising kids. You got to know that this is a responsibility. You have to take care of those kids. Kids don’t always follow what their parents do. My kids are no different. They had all the tools there for them to follow in the line of music, but my first thing was physical with them. That they had to learn how to walk up the stairs. I didn’t want any lazy kids in my house. We ran track when they were three years old. They were doing cross country running… yeah, or we leave you behind! Let me tell you why. I got all girls in my family. I got one boy and for a long time me and him sat on the couch every time my wife went to the hospital to have a child and we would wait to see what was coming. When we heard it was a girl he said, “Not again.” Nothing has changed. Now these kids have had kids, and it’s still girls! And we say, “Not again.” But it’s a blessing because the girls don’t leave you. I’m going to start a singing group. I will make them play a band. Those girls can do everything a boy can do and they’re not tomboys. They took up karate because they had to defend themselves. I knew that my son was going to have a hard time. He said, “Dad, I can’t keep running out there defending them. They’re always getting into some argument.” So, I had the girls learn and it turned out to be pretty good. We studied Shotokan and they can take care of themselves. You got to be very careful with the martial arts. You got to learn what it’s really about. That it’s open hand. That it’s only for defense when you need it. You’re not supposed to go around using it. You’re not supposed to boast about it. You’re not even supposed to talk about it. That’s something that’s instilled in the way of life. All it does is it’s supposed to help you with the other things that you want to do. Unfortunately that didn’t happen in my family because some of them were sore losers and they didn’t want to lose. They would come in second and they didn’t want to lose. We had to get out of it. Yes? Audience member At some point in your life you were able to see that rap was going to be the future of music, the new thing coming. What do you think is going to be the new thing in music nowadays? Joe Bataan OK, well I grew up through a lot of phases, from rock-and-roll, before that it was rhythm-and-blues... Actually my first love of music was show tunes. The Gershwins, Cole Porter, things like that, that’s how I grew up. Annie Get Your Gun, Carousel, stuff like that I love. Especially “Rhapsody in Blue” is my favorite. I saw these changes, I saw the Twist come, I saw Chubby Checker get that from Hank Ballard. I saw that craze come, I saw Elvis Presley come through, I saw Frankie Lymon with rock-and-roll, then I saw the disco era come through, and then when the rap era came through… [and then] reggaeton was happening. How long that will last, I don’t know. I’ve always been at the forefront of bringing something back, which I’ve been trying to do for 40 years, I haven’t been successful. What I want to do is I want to bring back the squaredance, but I want to bring it back hip. So hip that I have to get somebody to help me put it together because I’ve got to have the right exact music. I’m thinking about R. Kelly. He might be the right guy. I think I made some notes, because he’s really a genius. Listen to the stuff that this guy does. I believe that when he did that reggae “step, step,” this is what I see with the square dance, but the square dance we will definitely do “do-si-do, grab your partner,” and I’d see all these people having fun on the dance floor, but it would be done hip. It won’t be like “Get your partner [shrill],” no. It will be like Get your partner [gruff],” and it will be hip. That might be the next wave of music. Audience member Hello. Actually thanks, first of all, for your music and when you mentioned Salsoul record label. I was so happy because [inaudible] by Salsoul Orchestra is one of my favorite records. So I actually really appreciate it. How does it relate to the Salsoul Orchestra, which were a large band to your record label, because it was a gold mine. Joe Bataan Well, let me tell you. Salsoul wasn’t existing when there was nobody there. I was the only one there on the label. There was no artists, they were dealing in Mexican music, guaracha. Songs like that that they were importing and selling cut-outs. When I introduced the word Salsoul as a company, my first album was called Salsoul. The concept was to bring together, merge Latin and soul. Later on, when I had my arguments with Salsoul, and they felt that they picked my brain for everything that I gave them, I showed them the Philly Sound, I showed them Jimmy Young, they actually got some of these musicians to come down from Philly to play for Salsoul. The end result was a Vince Montana that came down. He wrote a lot of those songs, he became the leader of the Salsoul Orchestra, but he did not start Salsoul Records. The whole concept was mine. He was very successful, so were a lot of the other artists, so was Kenny Cayre. They did this in the absence of me, when they actually booted me out of the company. Audience member How was it to have those singers, related to most important disco hints in that era, and did you ever meet Patrick Adams or any producers like that? Joe Bataan Yeah, I don’t remember all their names. Patrick was a good friend, he was a very talented guy. He was always understood, he was at the forefront of bringing a lot of those acts. You’ve got to understand, Ken Cayre, at that time, let everybody come up to the studio. You’ve got to understand, Salsoul was like Motown. Everybody and their mother wanted to be a part of Salsoul, so everybody came up there. There’s no way in hell that you’re not going to see everybody. Every DJ in the country was calling Salsoul. Every producer from Tom Moulton to Patrick Adams, but they all went up there and they all brought their products, and some of it got paid and some of it used, some of them made a few dollars, but the essence was, they didn’t start it. They came in after, to be a part of the Salsoul family. That’s the only inkling that I have with the Salsoul record label, that it was my concept, my idea, and my name. Patrick Adams, all those guys, I’ve worked with them and they’re very talented. You got what’s his name, Patrick – oh, boy, I forget all these names, all these groups… BT Express, the guy that did with him, all those guys, they had different labels and they had made different deals with different record companies, at that time. Disco was a wide-open market, so if you look at those records, you will notice that most of those records were played by the same guys, like Bernard and those guys, they were the hit-makers during that era, similar to Motown. That group that played all those hit records, they never got credit. Until recently, when they made the movie, that you knew that these guys played in all those big hit records for all those R&B artists. The same thing holds true for disco. The Babbits… all those guys and the Cornell Duprees… They all played on those songs, but, of course, they were in the background. They were making money as side-men but they weren’t in the forefront of their own records until some guys like Bernard [Edwards] did Chic and stuff like that. Audience member You had said something Gil Scott Heron and I just wanted to know how was that experience for you? Joe Bataan In the UK, they had that hit record, “The Bottle”, in New York, and it was on a label, I forget the label. Salsoul? Right. and it was an independent label, I think something from Harlem, and they ran into financial trouble. One of the hit, biggest disco record of that time, and when they were playing it, they didn’t have the money as you know. If you don’t know, you can go broke with a hit record. Let me explain. It takes eight weeks to break a record. Now, if you want to have any kind of luck, you got to get this record played all over the country at one time. There’s very few people who can do that. RCA, Sony? But a little label like Salsoul, back in that time, it couldn’t do it until they got bigger… They’re not going to do it, they don’t have the manpower, they don’t have the money to put that record. Just to produce that record, you know how many records you would have to make? Suppose you don’t get it played, you got to eat the records, then you go broke. That’s why you’ve got all these record stores going bankrupt. I believe somebody just went bankrupt now – Tower Records. I’m probably not going to get paid, I had some records in there. They knew what they were going to do, they started selling everyday cut-outs, started selling them for a dollar. You watch any of these record stores when they start selling things for a dollar, because they’re getting ready to file Chapter 11. So, there’s no difference in the industry. They had to put out this record, they had no more money and they sold about $50,000. Great. So, when it came time, the stores were demanding more records, they had no more money. That means the record was going to die and they were going to go broke. That can happen to a lot of people. So you have to be on time. You have to know exactly your market. For instance, if I came to Australia, and I wanted to play a record and I wanted to make sure everybody bought it, I would have to have a nucleus, what would be a nucleus that everybody would enjoy before I take a chance. I wouldn’t bring here a merengue song thinking that everybody was going to buy it, and they didn’t understand it. So that’s where you can go broke. You should be the last one to praise your work. You should always ask others, outside interest, so, that you know you’re getting some sort of help. Jeff Chang Did you actually bring in Gil Scott Heron and Brian Jackson then when you were doing your cover of “The Bottle”? Joe Bataan No, he was gone. Jeff Chang I just happened to… I met him later. He was so happy and proud what I did to his song. He mentioned it in his last documentary I hear, he calls me the mayor of New York. Hopefully I’ll meet the guys when I go get to the UK. Jeff Chang Do another question? Oh, back this way. Audience member Were you ever involved with the Latin freestyle? Joe Bataan I’m sorry I didn’t hear that? Audience member Were you ever involved with freestyle? Jeff Chang Freestyle, you know… the freestyle sound. Joe Bataan Oh! Yes, well I did “Shaft.” It might not be a record that was recognized at that time, but there was a Francis, who played at the Sanctuary, and that was one of the discotheques over at Cemetery that we used to go to. The first time I went there, I went ... Jeff Chang Francis Grasso? Joe Bataan Yes. Yeah, and he was one of the first DJs to play Joe Bataan, and a lot of us weren’t even thinking about their records to DJs, and I had found a gold mine when I was allowed to come into the club, you know? I went up to him, he introduced me, he listened to the record, and he played it. Then I was finding out a source of energy and sale marketability that no one else knew in New York, and that was the disco. I was on the forefront of the club scene before most artists, promoters. They didn’t recognize it. They didn’t know what could be generated out of a club, and Francis played that “Shaft” I’m telling you, he played the hell out of it so much that I was selling records before it was even played on the radio. They forced the radio to play my songs. He was one of the first and of course then there was Larry Levan. Jeff Chang During the 80s, when they had the freestyle sound, like Nocero or Noel or, you know, Exposé, different groups. Did you do any work at that time or was that more of a Miami type of thing? Joe Bataan Well, I did work, a little, traveling to Europe, you know, doing tracks, you know what I mean, with “Rap-O Clap-O,” and things like that, yeah. That’s it. Jeff Chang By the late 80s, not ... Joe Bataan No, no, I was sort of in a self-induced retirement. Jeff Chang Uh-huh. Nice. Other questions, comments? Joe Bataan Guess everybody wants to save their energy for tomorrow. Jeff Chang Yeah. I think so. Well, ladies and gentlemen ... oh, right here. Mic, okay. Audience member [Inaudible] Joe Bataan No. That was done in 1969. That story was actually about me. When I write my songs, I used to challenge myself, as you will notice if you look into my song, I rarely mention the word love, because I tried to describe the emotion in love with other words. I wanted to be known for something that was different than every other artist, because I know I didn’t have the great voice, so I had to bring something else to the table that I would be remembered by, so I tried to adapt my songs so nobody could copy them. I would take it someplace else, or I would use a lot of words, where it wasn’t natural, and that was my only protection beside of copyright of anybody trying to steal my songs or something and then it developed into a style. “Young, Gifted and Brown,” as it starts, as you could see, and then you could tell my age, “On a rainy Sunday morning in 1942, my mother was blessed with a son who grew up to be young, gifted, and brown.” Audience member You mentioned that song is about the attempts to change the world around, and that’s… Joe Bataan Kind of funny, I mean, when I wrote that, a guy told me about “My Cloud,” he said “Joe, you were preaching back then and you didn’t even know it.” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Listen to the words of Mike Cloud, and look what you’re saying. ‘Thank you, Lord, for the clouds you made for me,’ and it’s a testimony… it’s the Lord.” I never wanted to be alone. I always had to be with somebody. My wife has been with me for 35 years, and we’re inseparable. We got our problems, and things like that. It got so that when I stopped playing, she actually took me out of the business. There were a lot of women, and things like that, you know what I mean, and I finally had to psych her into joining the band. I got her to learn how to play the maracas and sing, and now she performs with me, so I’m allowed to go everywhere. Jeff Chang We’ve got one more question… Audience member [Inaudible] Jeff Chang Great question. Joe Bataan Let me explain. I think I understand what you’re saying, but let me round it out into my story. Here I am, 9 years old, and I’m looking in the mirror on a tenement in 104th St, and I’m saying, “What the hell am I?” I look at my hair, and I touch it, and I say, “Why can’t our hair be like this?” You’ve got to understand growing up at that time who our heroes were. We didn’t have black history. The music that was played wasn’t our own, and I was looking for identity. I was the only kid on the block that was part Filipino and black. Most everybody was Latino, and going to school I kept thinking that I was short-changed in life that I wouldn’t be allowed to go here because of the racism that existed in the world. I couldn’t go here, and I couldn’t do this, if I didn’t do this, so right away I was sort of handicapped. It wasn’t until later on that I was able to appreciate my heritage, because I grew up with Latinos and they all thought that I was Spanish, and I would give you an argument. I could speak Spanish. Then I had that part of me being black. My mother… you could see it, we’d go down to the neighborhood. She was from Newport News, Virginia. There was no mistaking my mother was black, all right. Here growing up, my friends were of all different races. I never had a racist bone in my body until I grew up, until I started seeing the world, until I went down South, and the guy looked at me, and I got on the bus, and I sat where I wanted to sit, because all I know is what I grew and how I grew up in New York, and they say, “Joe, you’re crazy, you can’t do that.” Then I say, “Shit, ain’t nobody telling me nothing.” I had this attitude. Maybe it was a mistake. Nobody bothered me down South. I don’t know why. I said I went to the movies, ain’t nobody touch me. I was waiting, I was hoping somebody’d say something to me. Having grown up in New York, being free to do what I wanted to do, I didn’t realize I was ignorant about things that they were throwing lye in the pools in St Augustine in Florida, they were hanging people, they were shooting people in the back, I had no idea until later on, until I started to become self-conscious in civil rights in the things that were being done to us. Then, I was angry, and it wasn’t until 1976 that I recorded an album, and I said, “What the hell am I now? Shit, I’m tired. I keep identifying myself. I’m a human being. Why the hell do I got to be anything anyway?” I named the album Afro-Filipino. Nobody took notice of the album. The guy asked me to do the song for Chico and the Man with Freddie Prinze and Jose Feliciano beat me out. Jeff Chang My family did. Joe Bataan I found that out later, when we heard about the yellow seed, and all the different things that it involved, with Filipinos nowadays. I found that there were a lot of Filipinos like me, that were of mixed heritage. In New York, in the barrio we don’t see no Filipinos. The few that we saw used to gamble upstairs, you know. Asian people love to gamble. When I went to California, then I started to get a consciousness because I started seeing a lot of Filipinos, and they were just like me. Then I started to realize, “Hey, I’m part a Filipino,” and be proud of being part Filipino and black, and then it came out and lo and behold I have a following now with the Asian community, which is a blessing because it’s coming forward because now, if you will see, when anyone comes to see Joe Bataan perform, there’s no telling who’s in the audience. It’s been like that for some time, and I like it like that. You don’t know who’s in that audience. You can’t depict that it’s one particular nationality. I’m known for a song in every different country. Somebody has a favorite of mine. When I went to Colombia, South America, they made me get off the plane, and they made me sing to prove that I was Joe Bataan, because they said, “You look like his son, and Joe Bataan has got to be about 92 years old in a wheelchair. You’re not going to fool us out here and take our money,” so here I was singing a song that was three octaves higher than what I did when I was a kid, and they let me come into the country. Japan, I think I was known for “The Bottle.” New York, “Ordinary Guy.” California, “My Cloud.” UK, I don’t know, they’re starting to play some of the Spanish songs, from what I hear. They’re playing me all over the old radio last year. Italy, it’s “Rap-O Clap-O,” “Latin Strut,” “Ordinary Guy.” Bossa nova style, so I’m just so gratified and blessed that I’m able to say that, that I’ve lasted this long and I hope it’s just the beginning. Jeff Chang Joe Bataan. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. [Applause]
[Laughter]
[Applause]
So, Joe, you’re from Spanish Harlem. Tell us something about Spanish Harlem; some of us have been to it, a lot of us have not. Tell us about the musical
and street vibes about growing up in that area.
[Applause]
The first thing that Jeff said, growing up in East Harlem, there seemed to be a mystique. I hadn’t done anything for maybe the last 10-15 years, I was
stagnant. You know how you lose your confidence if you don’t do something continuously? And I was no different, it happened to me. I had had all this success with different forms of music, and here I was, I was idle. The music business was changing, I had seen it change maybe four or five times, but I didn’t know anybody, my contacts were all gone. It was different, younger
people creating the music, the same doors you went in before are not open anymore. So, growing up in East Harlem it was a constant struggle to find what
exactly you do. I came out of prison. I was always an advocate of singing in the streets and hallways, having a hand cupped over my ear to get an echo in the subway stations so you could do harmony by ear. I could do harmony before I could even read – that ear training
is so important. I don’t know how I would’ve developed my style if I’d been a student and had those opportunities and the absence of the emotional feel.
[Laughter]
They all looked at me and I said, “If you follow me, I’ll take you onto achievements you’ve never dreamed of in your life.” I had the spiel, the gift of the gab. The only problem was I had to convince their parents; because I was the neighborhood thug no one wanted their kids with me. So, I walked them home every night after rehearsal. I’d have to convince their parents: “Look, let them play with me, I’ll bring them home every night. I don’t do that stuff any more, I play music. I want to do something with my life.” I had made these promises to these 11 or 12-year-old kids. The second-hand horns had holes in them, we
patched up some drums, we had cans. Whatever we could get. We were practicing three hours a day for six months. After six months, we were making records.
[Applause]
So, you’d actually recorded about eight albums for Fania Records in a course of five years and they couldn’t figure out a way to give you what you were worth.
You’d really helped build the label up, but you decided to break off. You held out for a year, but you decided to set up your own independent label, which was unheard of for an artist at that time. You helped start up a little label that became known as
Salsoul. Can you tell us about that?
[Applause]

Title: John Dent (2008)

John Dent (2008)
The go-to guy for anyone seeking the analog dream in a digital world, mastering engineer John Dent started in the glory days of the industry, working at Island Records in the ’70s, and placed himself at the heart of London’s sound world, seeing the birth of the CD and the explosion of digital.
In his lecture at the 2008 Red Bull Music Academy, Dent explained why digital sound is inferior to analog and why MP3 doesn’t even register while taking us through the mastering process step by step.
Hosted by Benji B Today we’re going to be talking about the final stage in the recording
process, mastering. There are few people better to talk about that with us than the man on my left. Please welcome John Dent. [applause] John Dent Thank you very much. Benji B To kick off, what exactly is mastering? John Dent Mastering is about making choices. You’ve recorded the tracks, you’ve mixed the tracks and, in theory, you want to do something with them. The world out there is very competitive, lots of professionals making really good recordings, so if you don’t do something with them they may sound weak, lifeless and insignificant. It
may not seem like that while you’re working on it, but in my room in my studio in the west of England sits a pile of gear and a reference monitoring system, but you can tell in stark black or white whether something has got something or it hasn’t. I get a lot of material in the studio now, especially recorded and produced in the digital domain that actually doesn’t sound that clever. The files that I get in are probably seven to eight dB quieter than they need be. I’ve got the skills and the tools to create much bigger sounding files. But I don’t actually do it by just
hitting it with an L-2, which is kind of what happens in a workstation. My approach is a lot more subtle. I tell my clients I’m the plugin. I construct a signal path with this equipment and out of it comes some wonderful music. And I can give some demonstrations at some point. Benji B When you master a track, what exactly are you trying to achieve? John Dent There’s a number of factors. At the end of the day, someone is trying to say something
musically and that has to override everything. You also have to look at the type of musical style, the genre someone’s fitting in. There will be people who invent new styles, but there’s always a ballpark area that someone’s fitting in. In the real world we all listen to music that’s been finished and we accept what we hear. That music may well be a really good sound, a really good level and it’s an imprint, which becomes the identity of that music for its lifetime from then on. Once you know the tune, you hear it everywhere, and that’s the tune. Before you get to the mastering stage, I would say that’s not necessarily the case before you get to the mastering stage. I would say somewhere between five and ten percent of what I receive is approximately right, somewhere close to a good level, an ideal. Out of that five and ten percent, most of them would be the analog tapes that I get, not the digital recordings. I still have a very sound client base that works primarily in analog, but uses digital technology for the benefits it offers, the quick cut and paste and some of the effects they can use. But when you get a tape with a PJ Harvey track on it, sometimes you just record that into the digital system at zero and it automatically sounds fantastic, you don’t have to do a lot to it. The yardstick I use is I have a large database of
finished, mastered recordings I have, and I will always as a matter of course I compare what a new piece of music sounds like to this database. As an engineer I’m not actually in a rush to hit the knobs or tweak peoples’ sound until I’m sure what it is they’re trying to say. I have been known just to spend all day not doing any mastering, just playing the tracks for the project, trying to work out which tracks sound the best before you start – that’s quite an important one. Often the clients know that before they come in, they’ve been playing them around people, they get a feel for one
particular track that as a mix for some reason stands out as sounding better than everything else. So you can use that as a yardstick for the album and nudge everything else up until it sounds as good as that. Nowadays, with lots of different file formats and lots of ways of delivering to the studio, quite often I’ll often start a project with a huge pile of source material. Right now, I’m working on a Franz Ferdinand album at the moment. Some of the material is on tape, some of it is being mixed by four other producers and it’s coming in over the internet on FTP from different parts of the world. A lot of files are 24/96, some are 48k,
some are 44.1; and it’s my job to become the coordinator for putting this project together. In the middle off all this, the main producer has decided it would be nice to put some of the tracks to vinyl prior to making the CD. This job has been going on for about two months and it’s getting more and more complicated. When I get back on Sunday, the first thing I’ll do is go back to the studio to carry on because they’re giving me more and more bits and pieces to add to this album. Mastering can be as simple as doing nothing, or it can be a really in-depth
project, where once you get to the end of it so much has happened and transformed the project into a form perhaps no one would’ve thought of in the first place. Interesting things happen in the mastering room. I had a guy come in with an acoustic album, really struggling, because he wasn’t happy with the sound of his music, so I put that onto the vinyl lathe and he said, “That’s the first time my guitar has actually sounded like my guitar in the entire recording process.” He was really happy, so we did the whole project like that. Mastering is not a plug-in piece of software, it’s an approach. I’m from the old school approach, where my training and my experience is there for anybody in the music industry. There are others like me, but there’s not many others, and I’d certainly recommend that if you’ve got projects for which you want to explore an interesting approach to mastering and if you’ve got the budget to do that, the rewards are huge. Benji B Before we get into your background and history, maybe the best thing is to do a
“before-and-after”-type demonstration of what mastering can do to a record. John Dent There are a couple of things I’ve brought with me. There’s a Santogold single that was out earlier in the year. I have a copy of the original data file, which [Academy crew member] Erik [Breuer] should be able to play, then following that the master track. I was working under instruction from the producer. The recording sounds okay, but it has no weight
and it’s certainly a bit thin and distant compared to how I wanted it. The final result is actually quite weighty and heavy and it does sound good on the radio. So
this is a good example. This is before. (music: Santogold — “L.E.S. Artistes” before and after mastering) That was fairly obvious, I would’ve have thought. There is a lot of compression going on there, but it’s done in the analog domain so it doesn’t have that hard digital edge to it. The next stuff, after I was lecturing at Red Bull in Melbourne I came back and did some lecturing for the BBC. One of the guys in
the audience had some funding from the BBC to get an album started so he was at the same stage as a lot of you guys are at here. He heard my lecture he sort of checked me out and came down to do a few tracks. Bit by bit he’s been putting an album together and I’ve brought some before and after of his stuff because I was impressed
with his whole approach to it. There are three tracks, I think we can play before and after of each. (music: Dr Mika — unknown, before and after) John Dent: That’ll do. You get the idea. Clyde [Dr Mika] wanted it at a good level but he didn’t want to change the tracks too much. That’s the kind of art of getting mastering right. Benji B You say there aren’t many professionals around at your level. How did you get to that stage, what was your journey? John Dent It’s an interesting one. I started as a teenage record collector, mad about music, and my ambition was to record or work in music. I applied to the BBC; they had no vacancies but sent me a
list of London recording studios and I managed to get an interview in Advision studios. That didn’t happen, but my next interview was Trident Studios and they took me on. They needed three people to man the studio 24 hours a day, sort of tea boy, runner, assistant to the staff, and I was one of those three. Trident Studios is in Soho, Wardour Street, and at the
time it was probably the leading studio in the country, if not Europe. I’d got a job in a world where every day you walked in... Queen were managed by Trident and they were there most of the time with their equipment. David Bowie used to walk in the door. I had to prepare meals for him. Elton John recorded there. It was just a focal point for a lot of the music that was going on at that time. I was introduced to the studio environment, working as a tape op for the main engineers there, and whilst I was there one of the guys in the disc cutting room announced he was leaving and I asked if I could go in there. Being a mad record collector, the thought of having a disc cutting lathe there and having to do it myself was unbelievable. They gave me a try, they trained me, and I took to it literally, like a duck to water. It was clear they liked my approach and I liked being there. The training was partly sitting around watching what’s going on, partly talking about how the equipment works. And it was a completely analog set up. A quarter-inch tape machine was the main replay, some of the recordings were Dolby A, some of them weren’t. There was a nice analog console mainly full of 19-inch rack gear, Pultec’s and stuff like that. There was a Fairchild limiter, really nice monitors and a Neumann cutting lathe. So my
first training, on this nice ‘70s equipment. It was the mid-’70s and there was a big resurgence of music in the UK, punk, reggae. I managed to start doing a lot of the smaller bands who’d come in. They would tell their friends, oh there’s this guy at Trident who knows how to cut vinyl. Very quickly I had quite a named artist client base, just turning up for me to cut their records. I did all the Stranglers first material, their two first albums and the singles. I worked with Tom Robinson, “2-4-6-8 Motorway” was the big track at the time. The vibe was good. Ray Staff, who trained me, he was working a lot of rock bands. He worked with Genesis, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin. It was a real focal point for a lot of great music at that time. So I stayed at Trident, and one of the clients I was successful for was Island Records. They were cutting in New York and needed someone in the UK to do a lot of their reggae and they found that my approach really suited their material. So that’s when I started doing a lot of Bob Marley stuff. The first record I cut was “Waiting In Vain” as a single. I did “Exodus” as a 12". That lead on to me getting the Live at the Lyceum album, which really launched Bob Marley and the Wailer’s career with “No Woman No Cry.” Throughout my time there I was just being given more and more great music to work on. Benji B Do you want to play this? John Dent I suppose I could do. Benji B And this is something you cut, right? For Island. John Dent Yes, this is something I cut. (music: Bob Marley & The Wailers — “Is This Love”) The temptation is to keep listening to it all, but we’ll run out of time. Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island, used to attend the cutting sessions and while I was working on John Martyn’s One World album, Chris expressed a wish to have his own vinyl mastering studio. I just jumped at the chance. I said, “I’ll look for the gear, see if I can find a studio and come and work for you.” So that’s what I did. I sourced some equipment in Paris, made contact with the finance people at Island. We started a studio in 1979 called the Sound Clinic. Chris Blackwell always viewed the job I did like going to the doctors for a fix, so that was the name we came up with. I had a fairly free rein on the choice of equipment. Interestingly enough, I had access to American equipment, a Scully lathe, Westrex cutting amplifiers. I tried it out, it was a little bit coarse but had a fantastic sound, so we started the studio based on that equipment. It was slightly unconventional. We
were entering the ‘80s with lots of big producers, big budgets and I scared a few off. They came into my studio, saw that it wasn’t a Neumann lathe and got very insecure and went away. But the music I cut there was a lot of very influential Island stuff: Grace Jones, Robert Palmer, more Bob Marley, Steve Winwood. There was just more and more going on there. Benji B That’s an amazing era to be at Island, the era you’d want to be at Island. John Dent Yeah, it was. Benji B So you set up an in-house cutting room at Island. For anyone not familiar with
what a lathe is, can you explain? John Dent [points to pictures on whiteboard] Yeah, here’s a lathe. This is a VMS-70,
built by Neumann. The shape and form of the lathe dates back probably to pre-World War II. They kept the same basic design and format. In the early ’80s they did actually redesign the lathe, made it a bit more shiny, more buttons to push, but
actually I didn’t like the sound of it. There was a system on there for tracking the grooves and adjusting its depth, and it was doing it in time with the music and it sounded like a compressor, so I wasn’t a big fan. So when I
set up my studio at Loud I sourced the lathe that I trained on. It’s a big, heavy piece of equipment, you don’t want to move it around. Once it’s set up you leave it. You’ve got a microscope for
inspecting the grooves. Over here on this side there’s 600 watts per channel of cutting power and the cutting head – this black and yellow object in the middle – is a stereo transducer, like a loud speaker but with moving arms that actually
hold the stylus. The record is physically carved out. So everything you see on vinyl has been through a machine like this, whether it’s this make or Scully or whatever. There aren’t many people around who actually know how to work them, they’re strange beasts. Benji B And do you want to run through some of the people you cut during the time you were cutting at Island? You were telling me yesterday you cut for Dire Straits. John Dent Yes, I had a building reputation. Island was my biggest client and I spent a lot of time working on their material. I didn’t rush into things. I remember having “Could You Be Loved” to cut and because vinyl is a physical medium – some sounds get accentuated, some get lost – most people like a good vibe off the record. It has to be a certain volume to excite the cartridge. I was talking to Dennis Coffey the other morning and he was talking about guitar pick-ups, and he was saying the old Gibsons had more energy and he can’t stand the new ones. Similar thing, the record starts to sound good when there’s a decent level on the record. I’ve lost the thread... Benji B We were talking about the Island years. John Dent Oh yeah, so what happened, artists liked the sound that came off the record. If they were a big enough artist, they would actually insist that the same cutting room would cut all the major parts for the whole world. I did a double album for Dire Straits, Alchemy. And Mark Knopfler and the band really liked what I’d done, so the order came
in to do something like 15 sets of cuts on a double album for dispatch across the world. That order came in about two days before Christmas and I literally spent my whole time during that break period cutting Dire Straits records. But that’s how it used to happen. Some bands like Genesis would have six sets of vinyl cut, all simultaneously, and they’d then choose which of the six sounded best at the factory. People really did embrace this medium for their music and career. Working with Island, I was at Island through to the end of ‘86. I worked with lots of up and coming ‘80s artists: Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Paul Young. There was one edition of Top of the Pops, where every record on that had actually come through my studio. I’d cut about two-thirds of them and my assistant had cut the other third. It was quite a diverse thing, I cut three Motörhead albums. Rather interesting story with one of their tapes. I was working quite late into the night so I just placed one of their mastertapes on the bin at my feet, and to my horror the next morning they were gone. Island’s cleaner had actually thrown them away, and in the yard was one of these huge six-foot-high waste bucket things and basically we had to tip out to find the tapes. But we did, they were alright, but that’s the sort of thing that used to happen. Benji B And fast forward into the ‘90s, you set up a cutting and mastering room in London. John Dent That’s right. This really came about because of CD. The CD was invented, there were
companies like Phonogram pushing it, Dire Straits did one of the first CDs and my clients were saying, “John, are you getting the CD gear?” It kind of fell on the lap of the mastering companies to supervise transfers for CD. Island had changed quite radically by then. They had gone from the original record company headed by Chris Blackwell to a company was really kind of being motivated by accountants; it just wasn’t the same record label. I couldn’t get the money
from the label to get the CD equipment. It was very, very expensive. But there was no choice, you just had to have it. So I went to the bank, told them what I did and they were quite happy to lend me the money. So myself and my engineer Graham, we looked for premises; we found them in Camden, North London and started building the Exchange while we were working at Island. We didn’t tell anyone, it was a secret mission. The whole idea was we wouldn’t be off the air for long, people were relying on us for their cutting. At some point we did take Chris Blackwell aside and told him, “Look, Chris. This is what we’re doing. We’re leaving, Island aren’t coming up with the money.” He perfectly understood, and he even let us take all the equipment we were working on at the Hammersmith studio, so we had enough equipment for a second room. On top of that he said, “Look, I’m going to give you our entire back catalog to master for CD. Don’t pay for this equipment, just work your way through it.” So that’s what we did. We literally transferred hundreds and hundreds of albums. Fairport Convention, Cat Stevens, Free, you name it. Sometimes the original producers would come in and supervise. That’s how the Exchange got going. We had this independent studio and trained up a lot of engineers and the Exchange is still going. I’m no longer there, I wanted something more personal than the Exchange, which was rooms being shared by all manner of engineers. I’m the kind of guy who likes to switch off, go home and come in the next day with everything where you left it. I’m a project guy. So I decided to leave the Exchange, had a rethink about where I wanted to live and moved to the west of England. I put out a few feelers and managed to find some equipment very quickly – it took no more than a week to find a whole
mastering room’s worth of stuff – put the studio together, phoned my clients and it was like a switch. They all came and I just started working. That’s where I’ve been ever since. Benji B So we can find you at Loud Mastering. John Dent Loudmastering.com. Benji B So if I give you a DAT or a CD or a reel, can you explain the process from the moment I give you that to when it gets onto vinyl? John Dent Vinyl and CD are different mediums and there are things you need to do for vinyl that perhaps you don’t need to do for CD. The problem with vinyl is you can cut a very, very good record and sometimes very few people can actually play it back. A record player cartridge is effectively a filter and the better the cartridge, the better the record player, the less of a filter it is, you hear more of what’s on the record. Nowadays, most people have Technics turntables and DJ cartridges you can back-track. Those type of pick-ups actually do change the sound quite dramatically – they might have good bass, but they are changing the sound quite a lot. You don’t really hear what’s on the record. So when you come in with your DAT, the first thing I’ll do is transfer it onto a Sonic Solutions workstation. The reason for that is after a lot of listening, playing the sound off a workstation, the bass sounds much better than playing it directly off the DAT machine. It’s linked to clocking. Digital systems sound much better with a good clock, you get an extension of the bottom end and it sounds less harsh. So for a start, I make sure that every recording is played back as good as I can get it. And then you do need to explore. You need to play other records, you need to see what you’re dealing with. My first test cut is usually at a good level with nothing done to it, just so you can observe what happens. Quite often, the record needs more bass or it sounds a bit dull, you
form an opinion of what needs to happen. I do that on a range of decks, I’ve got about six different pick-ups I can plug in to get a feel how it sounds. Then you push it, you see how far you can go with it. As you push it things start to distort; “s”‘s break up, hi-hats start to break up, kick drums. As you cut a record, things like kick drums, the groove gets more extreme as you go towards the label and you get more jumping. You form opinions about where you’re going with that music. It will have a sound, it will have a level. If you’re doing it right, it will generally sound good and the next stage is to do the test cuts. Then you put them to lacquer. The lacquer is a much larger disc, a 14" disc, an acetate disc covered in nitrous acetate. The material is a bit like nail varnish. It’s quite soft, the modern day replacement
for wax, basically. The cutting machine will cut it, and we don’t play the master cut so there’s a cut for one side, then you concentrate on the other side, so you end up with a disc for each side that’s unplayed. We bolt it in a box, it gets sent to the factory. The factory washes it, sprays it in silver and electroplates it onto a disc and they pull off a reverse, that’s called the mother. That’s a metal version of the record in reverse, so instead of being grooves, it’s points that stick up out of the stamper that they make. So they then electroplate that again, so that’s the second stage of electroplating. Now you’re back to the record again, but in metal form, which is called the positive. The factory will play that and check that nothing strange has
happened – because it’s a physical process you get lumps of grit and plastic
and metal making noises. Once they’ve approved the positive they electroplate again and form the stamper, and that’s where you combine the two sides of the
record. The stamper is put onto the press. The press is a big machine that basically pushes plastic into the record, often with an automatic labelling system. It’s stamped out under heat and the record comes off the press with quite a jagged edge, which
is then trimmed on a hot wire. The records are then stacked in piles of probably about one hundred high with a weight on top to stop them warping and buckling. You may well have done the sleeve and label design and at that point it becomes a record, something to sell. In the middle of that process we do advise that we ask for test pressings from the factory. A lot can go wrong. One of my biggest bugs about the factory is that the hole when you cut it disappears in the center of the processing and they have to recut it. There are loads of records that are cut off-center and if you listen to keyboards and stuff they’re “wowing,” you’ve got a horrible sound. I’m constantly telling factories they’ve got it wrong because it becomes unlistenable, and if you really listen to something which hasn’t been checked out, unfortunately, you’re stuck with it. Benji B So we want to send our tracks to you to be mastered. What stage should they be delivered in? John Dent You’ve got to be happy with your mix. Everyone has to be happy with their mix. If you’ve got a mix that’s working for you – it may not necessarily be at the right level, but generally the sound and feel is right – then that’s the right time to send it in. If you like the idea of extra compression, extra limiting, then maybe you do some quick
CDs to send to the record companies or radio. Quite often it’s a good idea to send copies of the limited compressed version and the raw uncompressed version, at least so that I can see what the difference is and what makes you think that works. The equipment we use in the studio is more subtle. We can achieve better, bigger levels without losing too much. So it’s nice to get an idea of what you want without having the whole thing compressed out. Benji B Now, as a vinyl expert I was interested to hear you describe the difference between what we get from listening to a record and what we get from listening to a CD. John Dent The world of analog recording is very high resolution. By resolution you have to think in terms of pixels. In the days of multi-track recording, good desks and disc cutting, what actually got cut on record technically is about four times the
resolution of CD. So if it was a camera, the vinyl was four megapixels and the CD was one. Everyone had different types of record players, but with vinyl what you could do, if you started off with a cheap player, you knew with a bit more money and a better cartridge and record player you could retrieve some of that quality back. That’s what hi-fi was all about – there was a whole industry designed to retrieve as much of that resolution off the vinyl. And a lot of records cut pre-digital era have a fantastic store of sound on them and a lot of people use them for sampling because it is high-resolution sound. It’s a format that should be retained as an optional high-resolution format. Benji B Have you got something that you can show us? John Dent Yes, Zero 7 is an interesting one. They came to us a couple of years ago because they liked the concept of putting their music onto vinyl before making the CD. We did some tests, they took the stuff away and compared and decided that was what they wanted to do. So we did the whole album, the Garden album via vinyl
acetate. Benji B And it was recorded to tape, right? John Dent The original source was half-inch tape, mixed by Phill Brown, a very good engineer. Phill Brown actually mixed the Bob Marley Live at the Lyceum album that I cut back in the ’70s. And he mixed the Zero 7 album. Now, the album has been on vinyl so what we’re going to listen to is the CD version of it. What we’re listening to is a listening experience. (music: Zero 7 – “Futures” (CD and vinyl versions)) Could anyone hear the difference? What you’re listening to is resolution, the pixels and simplicity of process. I would liken analog and digital to a potato – this is the potato and that’s the chips. You have to chop it up to make chips. Once
you’ve chopped it, it’s never the same. The vinyl record is the unchopped sound. Benji B So if vinyl is four megapixels and CD is one megapixel, what is an MP3? John Dent No comment. It doesn’t really feature. An MP3 is just an outline, it’s a ringtone, an outline of what’s going on. Some MP3s are just one-hundredth of a good-cut vinyl record. It’s the subtleties, the way the reverbs are, the general feeling and listening experience that gets lost. An MP3 just tends to rattle at you. You can’t tell what drum-kit things were recorded on, what the guitar was, they’re just noises. This is a good example of where I come from in terms of my training, but also you guys should not lose sight of the fact there’s this other world out there. A lot of the sounds you try to create on your computers, especially if they come from the analog era, there’s a limitation. You just won’t get that full sound. It has to be by another method. I’ll give you another example. Benji B I know there are a lot of DJs in the room, a lot of vinyl lovers, but in terms of the ability to go straight to tape and then to vinyl, it’s a rare luxury... John Dent I’m going to have a slight diversion here, because otherwise I’ll forget. I’m going to show you a trick. I hadn’t even realized I cut this, I’ve got this sieve brain where I just keep working and working and working. I found this in my record cllection. I’m actually quite proud of cutting this. I’ll show you a little trick with this. (music: George Clinton – “Atomic Dog”) When we cut records, the aluminium discs we cut on are actually quite heavy. You do hear
a sound difference between a finished pressing and the disc we cut on. The disc we cut on sound better, it actually has a better bottom end. A 7" record is sitting on the turntable and it’s got no mass, it’s microscopically vibrating while you listen to it. You can buy
record clamps to clamp your records to the turntable and what it does is it gives you a much cleaner, bigger bottom end. There’s a glass on the turntable, that’s adding extra weight to stop it vibrating. You’ll get used to the sound of it, and then I’ll remove the glass and see whether you can hear the difference. (music: George Clinton – “Atomic Dog” continued) So another tip – if you can find a record clamp, clamp your records to the turntable, they sound better. Back to this resolution thing. I had a customer who brought in a Hendrix track and he wanted to use it as a reference to something he was doing. He played it to me off CD. I said, “That’s weird, half
the sound is missing.” “What do you mean half the sound is missing?” I pulled out this 7" EP, which I’ve had for years, and sure enough when you compare... Benji B You can tell something’s wrong just from hearing the CD and knowing the record? This was a mastered CD, not an MP3? John Dent Yes, it was a remastered CD from the same tapes. I’ll see what you think. The thing was, these records are very energetic, there’s a lot of stereo and you can almost hear Hendrix’s personality in the vinyl. But a lot that vanished on the CD. (music: The Jimi Hendrix Experience — “All Along The Watchtower” (vinyl and CD
versions)) [cuts between vinyl and CD versions] That was a slightly better demonstration. There are certain qualities about this that aren’t available on the CD. These qualities that are important to the soul of the music, and some of that just tends to go when you make CDs. Benji B On the subject of vinyl, for all the vinyl junkies in the room, can you tell me the proper way to set up a Technics turntable? I mean, cartridge and everything? John Dent OK. There’s a few issues. One is, you’ve got the weight of the stylus. With most arms, the starting point is a point of balance where you adjust the arm so it’s parallel to the record, parallel to the turntable. That’s only one part of it. You get
recommended weights for different cartridges – some need to be a lot heavier and records sound a bit thin and scratchy if they’re not the right weight. I do actually have a stylus balance, a device for weighing the weight of the stylus. But my primary way of doing it is to use my ears. If you’re too light you don’t get the bass, if you’re too heavy the top end suffers, so there’s this in-between area that’s OK. These decks are set with the arm in the right place. On some hi-fi decks you have the ability to move the arm backwards and forwards and a gauge that allows you to set the sides parallel. One of the important things is the anti-skate, this is the dial here. [points to side of turntable] I can do this in my studio very easily, I can pick up an uncut acetate and place it on my turntable. When you put the stylus down it shouldn’t skate towards the center or the other side, it should have a point of perfect balance. It’s difficult, I’m thinking of
pressing some up so people can set their turntables up. The other thing to look at is whether the headshell is orientated correctly, whether the
cartridge is vertical to the record. There are other issues, like whether the arm is too high, or whether it’s tilting forwards or backwards. To do it technically you need oscilloscopes and tones, but no one has that. So generally a bit of trial and error, spend time with it, just be patient and see where you find the best sound. Benji B Most of us are more familiar with going into nightclubs and seeing Stanton 500s or Ortofons or maybe like a Shure M-44/7, which are styli designed really to hold a groove or be very loud. But if you’re looking for a stylus to listen to records at
home, of high quality, what would you recommend? John Dent The stylus on here is a Stanton 890. I use it because it has a very linear frequency response. All the frequencies that are on the record are coming out at the right level. A lot of them don’t do that. Quite a lot of DJ cartridges have a bass rise or a midrange cut or they have a strange topping. There’s nothing wrong with that, they work, they have sounds, but for reference purposes I use the 890. There is actually a wiring arrangement I don’t agree with, so I’ve rewired this cartridge. There is actually one back at the studio direct from Stanton with the rewire which they
have done especially for me so I’m looking into selling that product. An 890
has both spherical and elliptical styli on it. This is where the whiteboard comes in. [goes to the whiteboard] It’s a bit of a lesson in groove sound here. When a cutting system puts music on, the stylus has a very fine edge and
it’s a very fine frequency response, going very high indeed. When your stylus plays it back, the idea is that you get everything back off the groove, but something strange happens with records, as I’ll explain. If you were to take an enlargement of a groove, I’ll give you some high frequencies. This is viewing a record groove from
above. Here’s viewing your high frequency movement. That’s one wall of the groove, there’s your center line, which is the point at the bottom and there’s the other wall of the groove like this. [draws three curved parallel lines] That’s the sort of wall you’d see under a microscope. I’m going to draw two
of these and show you the differences. There are some people who say they can tell what the recording is by studying the groove. When you have a spherical stylus, which most DJ styli are, it basically means the tip is round, so that round tip, when placed in the groove [draws circle in the bend of the three lines], it
clearly cannot go where the groove is. It’s too big and rides over the top. If you have an elliptical stylus it’s shaped like that, and what you see is the smaller diameter edges go into the groove. If you were to monitor the top end output of your record, if this was a graph [draws upside down T], so the record is actually
brighter and cleaner by playing with an elliptical stylus. Another few things about a record that people don’t realize is that the outside is moving quite a lot faster than the inside of a record. [spins record on deck] That movement is very fast whereas if you go on the inside it’s actually very slow. The groove is slowing down as you go towards the
label. One of the best forms of music to hear this effect on is a house tune with a big hi-hat that’s about ten or 11 minutes long, spread across the record at 33. For the first three-quarters of the record it all sounds fine, then on the last bit the hi-hats drop in level and the general grunginess of the sound starts to increase. Benji B Why is that? John Dent Back to the board [returns to whiteboard]. Imagine a slice of cake: There’s the center hole, and there’s your 12" record. The outside edge is moving fast and if you have a waveform on the outside edge, it’s spread over quite a large distance. If you cut the waveform on the center, it has the same shape but is more
squashed up. You have to imagine a squeeze-box, a concertina squeeze-box. On the outside edge it’s [spreads arms wide] and on the inside edge it’s pushed back together. Your record player finds it more difficult to play this [points to narrow waves] than this [points to wide waves] and the same thing happens in the difference between 33 and 45. 45, technically, is a better speed, and so is 78. Benji B I know the scratch DJs love to have the 33 always, but what’s better in your opinion? John Dent I think keeping the customer happy is better, but 45 is technically better. But I do recognize that for scratching and certain forms of music you can’t avoid 33, especially if it’s a long side. Forty-five only really works up to eight-and-a-half minutes. Once you get beyond that the amount of space
shrinks, so a lot of longer sides tend to be 33 and often you need to compensate for that – look at the top end, do test cuts and make sure it’s as close as you can get. Benji B Some of those 12”s cut at 45, you need a penny on top of the headshell to make it sit on the groove. Where do you draw the line between the quest for loudness and clarity and not overdoing it? John Dent There’s a common sense level you can work to, which I tend to use. A lot of people rely on release dates, they expect one cut or pressing to work for them, they expect it to tie in with a tour or whatever. If you have a lot of time, then
you can experiment with levels and I push the levels on a lot of things. The louder you cut, the less record players can play it back and the more problems you have with returns. There are a lot of jungle tunes you have to find ways
of playing them by weighting the stylus down. It’s to do with bass and energy, just the general power you can get into the grooves. It’s nice to have as loud as you can, but sometimes in practical you can go too far. Benji B Obviously, you’re very passionate about vinyl and I’m sure many of us are as well. Apart from a few major releases, it was actually dance culture and DJ culture and hip-hop that were keeping vinyl culture alive. But in hip-hop and dance now, when you go out and see your favorite DJ they’re not actually playing
vinyl, they’re playing Serato or CDs. In a lot of those genres vinyl is simply not bought or sold anymore. So when you’re putting your tunes together, unless you’re a Radiohead, someone who knows they can afford the luxury of making a loss, what’s the incentive for releasing vinyl these days? John Dent I certainly understand the financial implications. I think it’s more to do with creative satisfaction. If you’re spending a lot of time and energy working on tunes, to get even a small run of vinyl is a great way of getting your music out there. Interestingly enough, vinyl still trades on eBay at good prices. A good tune is a good tune, and people buy and sell records for £100 on eBay, so they don’t really lose their value. Good tunes should always be on vinyl and I think there is a resurgence of interest. I’m doing a lot of vinyl 7"s for bands now, and they just like the sound of three minutes of energy coming off the record. Benji B But I think some of those bands view a coloured vinyl 7" or whatever as a promotional novelty, as opposed to the actual format that it used to be. John Dent I don’t necessarily see that there’s anything wrong with it being viewed as a novelty. The fact you can produce a good-sounding record, once that novelty has worn off, at least it’s still available. Record labels won’t spend £500 pressing up 500 records but they’ll spend two grand on an advert that lasts one week in a
magazine. There has to be a kind of understanding of priorities in this type of situation. I work with a lot of artists whose record label won’t release the vinyl but they’ll come up with the money and do it themselves just because they want it out
there. There’s a certain prestige to having your own vinyl as well. Benji B Moving into the digital realm, can you tell me the importance of sample rates? John Dent Sampling, the nearest equivalent is in films – you have the frame of a film, snapshots. If you look at the way the snapshots are happening, the more samples per second you can sample at, the more accurate the sample of what you’re sampling, basically. We’ve come through a period where for years and years, a lot of people have been working at 44.1. Benji B 44.1 is for CD? That’s what you hear when you put in a CD? John Dent Yes, it is. And yes, the sound, it’s not horrible, but it has limitations. The real sound... maybe I’ll do another picture. [returns to the whiteboard] If you take real life as a five – the sound you hear in a room, or when you stand
in front of a drum kit or saxophone player – that’s a five. If you look at the analog era, good microphones, good mixing desk, decent cut, what you get is
something like a four. If you go to high resolution digital, 24/96 is somewhere around three to four. Benji B What does 24/96 mean? John Dent 24 is the dynamic range of the recording system. 96 is the sample rate – 96,000 samples per second. With digital you have good analog at one end [points to five], and CD is somewhere down here [draws a one and two], it’s not that clever, the amount of information coming through is not that great. So
historically we’ve gone from somewhere much better. The tunes people rave about, those old tunes from the ‘70s, or ‘60s soul, those were all fours in terms of recording. There’s a limit on a 44.1 sample system, you won’t be able to get a four, just an approximation of it. I encourage our clients to work at high sampling rates wherever possible. We master our CDs and retain the higher sample rates. It’s only at the end of the session that we’ll down-sample it for CD
and we have a way of doing that. Benji B So your master CD stays...? John Dent The master in our studio stays at least 24/96. Our equipment does sample at 192, and for practical purposes – file storage, using a lot of the digital outboard gear – it gets down-sampled to 96 and that’s how it stays. It’s a
practical issue – there’s not much gear around in the outboard world that works at 192. Benji B What’s the highest sampling rate around at the moment? John Dent The one-bit SACD. It’s 2.8mHz, a huge, huge sampling rate. It’s a completely different technical system to PCM, Pulse Code Modulation. The SACD is an interesting one. I was invited to Abbey Road Studios to listen to the pioneering development of it. Sony have a huge back catalog of material, much of which is deteriorating, and they decided to invent a system that is so fast at sampling that they could sample all their analog stuff without worrying that they lost anything. They did lots of tests, I was invited to Abbey Road, they had a live band playing, a super audio recorder, a half-inch tape machine and we were all invited to compare and listen to what these two systems sounded like. Sony kind of refined it, and they’ve been using that system to archive all their material going right back to 78s and metalwork and stuff. Engineers around the globe were just archiving vast amounts of material so it was stored in this form and
a by-product of that was the Super Audio CD that was then put out, which hasn’t really taken off as much as Sony perhaps thought it would. But nevertheless, there is an alternative option. Pyramix do an audio workstation that records SACD. Benji B If you’re working with audio that’s already 16 bit, is there any point at the end of the session when it asks you to bounce it to 24 bit? John Dent That’s a good question. I actually do this. I find in my room, with the equipment set at 24 bit, I like what it sounds like. If systems are at 16 bit, you have to be careful with some, they throw in dither, a noise in the digital recording, which can change the tonality of the sound. If you have too much of this dither added, it can change the sound. By keeping the systems 24 bit the dither is automatically not there. Benji B But as a general rule we should always work at a higher sample rate and use 24 bit if we can? John Dent Yes, I’ve been working at 96k for my mastering in the last couple of years and it’s a much more pleasurable experience. You’re hearing more detail and more energy and I’m a better engineer because of that. I had a session recently with someone from Italy where I had to revert back to working at 44.1 and I was surprised
by how much I didn’t like it. 24/96 starts to remind me of where I came from. Benji B So is the point of mastering to be as loud as possible? John Dent [laughs] No, I know my studio is called Loud but it ought to be called Loud Enough. Benji B This is a leading question, because there’s a lot of talk about the so-called
loudness wars. Is it the new Metallica album that’s...? John Dent I think the Arctic Monkeys, there have been a few. To me, loudness has always been there. I worked on the Motörhead stuff and, you know, Motörhead have got be loud. You looked at the way the engineer produced that material, he’d put the tape on and the needle on the VU would go up to plus one and actually stay there, it wouldn’t move. Such was the level of limiting and compression, you could almost line the tape machine up using a Motörhead tape. It’s not so much the loudness. I think loudness is kind of a subjective thing. Loudness isn’t the same as hammering something with a limiter. A well-recorded piece of information can sound loud without necessarily being loud. What I try to do is I offer my clients a scale. Someone brings in a recording and it sounds quiet. So I look at
it on the meters, I listen to it, I do some comparison and say, “Oi, Carl, your CD is eight dB quieter than it need be. What do you want to do about it?” And he has a think and asks for it be bumped up. You then get into the realm of how far to bump it up and you have to look at the music. If the aim of the track is full pelt and needs to be maximum volume, there’s no point making the entire track the same level. So you have to look at how far you can push it before it takes it away from the actual design of the track in the first place. That’s what I do, and I will always use my
analogue gear first in preference to the digital gear. You get much, much better sounding compression and it sounds more natural. Some of the comparisons there, the Dr Mika stuff, I don’t think there’s any compression there at all, it’s all done in analog. That tends to give you a bigger, wider, fatter version of what you started with, but not clipped and unlistenable. But some people don’t have that approach. They will literally hit the digital limiter so hard that everything is mashed up. Benji B I’ve heard people say that 50% of the tune is in the mix. If that’s the case, how much of percent of it is the mastering? John Dent That’s a tricky one. For some recordings, very little; for other things, I think the mastering can make quite a big difference. It’s all about vibe, you have a vibe when you’re recording a track and sometimes it can get a bit lost. Sometimes the vinyl or CD master can nudge the vibe back into the sound. How you do that is sometimes a bit strange. I sometimes choose the signal path – I’ve got an analog limiter that sounds a certain way and I know if I put
some hip-hop through it, it automatically sounds the way it should do. It sounds more authentic, bigger, wider, a bit rougher. Correctly mastered stuff will enhance. And at the end of the day, that is what a lot of people hear. If you go out and buy stuff, you don’t really know if it’s the mastering or the recording. I think the mastering should not take anything away. For some people, it contributes an enormous amount. Some years ago I did Goldfrapp’s first album. Will and Alison came in with a pile of DATs, had no idea what they really wanted. I said, “If you do that, you can get this.” I started a bit of compression. They said, “No, we don’t want any compression.” I said, “Just let me do something.” So I prepared everything, mastered everything, gave it to them, they took it away
and they just said, “Wow, this is fantastic.” And that’s how we left it. Hardly changed anything. So my influence and approach did a lot for that project, because they hadn’t seen it at the beginning. The mastering helped get that record off the ground just because of what I put in. Benji B What do you actually do? What is the mystery magic? We know what’s involved in mixing a record, but what do you do to give it the magic? John Dent I think the thing is what you don’t do to it. Benji B You say that, but we just listened to something you made sound a hundred times
stronger and fatter and bigger and all of those words. John Dent I put a lot of emphasis on what individual bits of equipment sound like. I choose my workstation, I run with a Sonic Solutions system, I’ve always used that system and I’ve made endless comparisons but I still find it sounds bigger, wider, stronger and clearer. Sonic Solutions were the first people on the planet to put digital files and audio files onto a computer. There was
another system used in the video industry, but they actually pioneered sound tools and a lot of other systems came after them. There’s something about the way they do it I can relate to. So I start off with a good workstation and basically use that to play material off whatever sample rate it is. I then have a number of signal paths, either digitally or analog, that give me a certain sound texture. I do use a lot of valve equipment. The most recent stuff I’ve got is device called a Manley Slam, an analog limiter but it’s got an interesting digital I/O on it, and it’s probably the warmest digital transfer
device. They’ve got a really thick manual with lots of abstract blurb about how they went about this design. The actual chips are used by Nagra on their equipment. I do just listen to all this stuff. I’ve got a tape machine sitting there, and quite often as part of the session we’ll just place the stuff on the tape to see what it sounds like. We do have those kind of “wow” moments. People will sit there, not really knowing what to expect, and you put it onto tape and listen to it and you see lke a whole row of faces light up, like “Wow!” And you know you’ve hit on something. Sometimes putting something on tape will give you a couple of perceivable extra dBs without doing anything. I’ve had people say, “Is that all you’re going to do?,” because they’ve seen other engineers go mad. But yeah, it doesn’t need anything more. That’s all we’re gonna do. It’s just picking and choosing and using your ears. Same process with recording: You have a choice of microphones and things you do. Benji B Let’s listen to some more examples. John Dent Yeah, we’ve got the Bauhaus actually. I haven’t hit you with Bauhaus yet, have I? Record companies from time to time reissue early material and the technology around now is much, much better at retrieving information off of tape. I’m involved in remastering a lot of 4AD and Beggars Banquet recordings, people like Gary Numan and Cocteau Twins and Bauhaus, they were
all big in the ‘80s. I’ve brought in a Bauhaus remaster to show you what the vinyl and the remastering does. [to engineer] Have you got the original CD version? This is a recent transfer. (music: Bauhaus — “Double Dare” (original CD version and remastered vinyl version)) When you play the tapes there’s an enormous amount of weight in the recording, you play the tapes with monitors and it sounds heavy. When we listen to the CD that was done in the ’80s, all that weight is completely
missing. It’s a much thinner electronic sound. What we’re trying to do is get a better snapshot of what came off the tapes. Benji B Have you got any contemporary electronic music, because I know you cut a lot of stuff for the Bristol jungle guys and you do house and hip-hop and everything don’t you? John Dent In the rush to come here I didn’t really have any time for the “before-and-afters,” to be honest. The stuff I’ve brought I was kind of interested in... This is recent, PJ
Harvey, not exactly Bristol jungle. But it does kind of demonstrate certain things. (music: PJ Harvey - “Dear Darkness” / cuts between CD and vinyl version) Benji B So I thought what was quite interesting was you’ve got one of your clients sitting in the room right now, Mr. Pritchard. Mark, you’ve been working with John for a while, right? Mark Pritchard Yeah, I reckon since maybe eight years. Maybe longer. Benji B It would be interesting to know what stage you deliver the track in. Obviously, you live in Sydney now, John’s in the west of England. How do you make that work? What’s the process you go through, the back and forth? Mark Pritchard One of my biggest worries about moving to Sydney was I wouldn’t be able to access John so easily, because I learned so much just from going into the studio and hearing him do his thing. But now luckily with FTP sites I can mix a track in 24/96 normally, then upload it to the server, then John will take it off the server. Maybe I’ll call him and if there’s
something in the mix that wasn’t quite right, speak to him about what I think may be the problem. But generally, I’m really happy with it. John will do his thing, upload it to the server, I’ll take it off and check it. On the album I’ve just done we nailed maybe 60% first time, then there’s two or three tracks he had another go at, then maybe another couple another go again, two or three attempts at. John will do his thing, I’ll listen, live with it for a bit, play it against other tracks. Certain tracks are standing out because it’s quite a varied album, it takes a lot of time to get the balance right between tracks. It’s, like, a long process. John was moaning at me a lot. John Dent In the middle of all this Mark discovered stems, which instead of sending the mixed track, sends sub-mixes, maybe three or four pairs, and it opened up a lot more possibilities because you could deal with, say, the bass separately to the main track. But actually in the end, I think working from stems made it a much better-sounding record. Mark Pritchard I used to do lots of takes, where I’d do drums up, bass up, bass down, vocals up, lots of passes, which engineers would traditionally do. Having to upload it to the FTP – and with 24/96 files you’re talking maybe 150MB a song and you’re uploading maybe eight or ten versions and John’s got to take them off to do his thing – I just thought well, instead of doing that I’ll just do stems of the basic simple elements. So if it’s a track that’s reliant on bass, I’ll put it down with just the bass, then with no bass. At least then if there’s a problem between, say, the kick drum and the bass relationship, because I wanted more bass, but John’s limited at the point where he’s going to add bass but maybe the kick
was heavy. There are always limitations with that, but when you’ve got them separately, it allows you to push the bass up without affecting the kick. If the kick is a bit weak you can put bass under the kick without affecting the bassline. The stems sounded better than just the master as soon as we listened to them. Having a track with no bass, then listening to the two together, it sounded better than with everything together, just the way Sonic Solutions would play it back. Benji B So in a sense, at that stage, when you’re doing it like that there’s an element of mixing to the mastering thing too. John Dent There has been. I’ve always been the type of engineer that’s embraced these kinds of add-ons. Back when I was
at the Exchange, I had Rory Gallagher, the guitarist, wanting to add more guitar parts while we were cutting the record. So he came in with his roadie and set up his DI box, we rigged up a bit of a mixer for him and he put some more power chords in live while we were cutting the record. Historically, vinyl, its roots were live recordings on film sets and studios would literally cut live to wax. That was how vinyl was actually being used. Later on, tape came along and people would think more about what they were doing. But that’s the origin of vinyl – this instantaneous recording medium. Look at an old ‘30s cop movie in the States and you’ll se a couple of detectives with big hats on, standing around a disc cutting machine while they’re taping a phone conversation. Disc cutting had a bigger place in the world than it has now. Benji B Time to see if there are any questions about mastering. Mark, have you got any of your tunes? Mark Pritchard I’m going to see if I’ve got a “before-and-after,” which would be depressing
for me but would give a good indication. Benji B Even if you’ve just got the “after” it would be good to play something. Mark Pritchard One question people ask me is, “What’s the point of working at 24/96 if the track will end up as 16/44 at best, more often than not 320 MP3 or lower?” Why do you think it’s better to work at higher sample rates? John Dent I don’t think lower sample rates are going to be around forever. I think with faster and higher data transfer rates, people will get fed up with files that barely sound alright, in the same way that recording on tape is clearer. Benji B But this is the issue. People who come from a vinyl, DAT, tape or before era might get fed up, but people who’ve just started to listen to music now, their ears have been trained to listen to these horrible files. How
do you persuade them to get bored of hearing that? John Dent I think it’s a personal realization thing. If people don’t want to embrace high-quality sound, that’s fine, that’s their choice. I do think that the listening experience is something that is quite important. If you go back to the ‘60s, when there were very few radio stations and everything was done through the medium of vinyl, there was quite a powerful energy in that. People were listening to music in a way that was very different. There’s a lot of diversity now, people can all talk about their favorite music but it won’t be the same, whereas back then people tended to follow the same kind of music. There was a lot of poetry in the songs, a lot of messages, obviously political stuff and it was all getting across. Part of what was happening was the sound. I’ve been here where you’re all working, sitting in
the studio listening to the Temptations records and everyone’s going, “Wow, listen to the sound!” Well, if they’d recorded them all as MP3 to start with, they wouldn’t be sitting there going “Wow!” There’s something about having your original masters as good as you can, because you don’t know where it’s going to go. A film company might want to use your tracks and to have them in fantastic recordings would work really well because high sampling rates are used in the world of DVD. So it is a personal choice. Benji B So back to Mark’s question, what was it Mark? Mark Pritchard Why use 24/96 when it’s going to end up being lower at the end of the day? John Dent When you’re working the degree of separation between the sounds is much better. Resolution means you can hear everything in the mix where you want it to. It’s also power and energy. The vinyl has a power and energy, the high sample
rates have a power and energy. So it’s not just the recording, it’s what you feel, it’s whether that moves you in a way that perhaps an MP3 wouldn’t. If all the world was left with was MP3s, I think something very vital would be lost. I would run a sort of parallel with the world of art. If you look at paintings, artists quite happily paint on canvas, they’ve been doing it for hundreds of years. If you were to say, “No more canvas, we won’t make them from now on. No more paint; you can just do it all on computers from now on.” What would happen to the world of art? It’s the same with audio. Audio is a bit strange, you wouldn’t dream of buying a
camera with fewer pictures than were available when you were young. The cinema experience with widescreen is fantastic compared to watching it on some kind of five-inch digital thing sitting in your hand. That experience in audio is people working with this higher fidelity sound. We may not be able to deliver it now but in the future I think that will happen, and I think it’s a lost opportunity not to have people’s work in that form. Audience Member From what I heard it sounds like, the output of your work is really worth it, comparing input and output. So worth it that I probably couldn’t afford it. What I was wondering if you have any suggestions for people like us who need to do this work by ourselves, probably with the computer? John Dent If you’re doing it yourself, I would certainly advise comparing, like I do, to whatever else is out there. I’d even advise that even before you start tracking. Put information on your system, finished recordings and try to work out what it is about them that you like, what makes it work for you. Apply descriptions to every sound – is it bright? Is it harsh? Does it sound okay flat? Say you do a recording and it only sounds a couple of dB quieter than you want it, then in that instance a bit of L2 just to amplify it is absolutely fine. The type of mastering where I get involved is when people want to radically move their recordings away from where they are. Some people actually know what can be done so they can expand on that and use it more. I think just be aware that there is this other world out there, but if you haven’t got the money, at least make sure you get the sound right throughout the recording mix and if you need to nudge it up, just nudge it up. We have a budget mastering
service. My other engineer, he just sticks stuff into Sequoia and he does a simple levelling task. And some clients are perfectly happy with that: Andy McKay from Roxy Music, he comes in from time to time and has that done.
The reality is he could do it himself, but we’ve got good monitors and good meters, so we can with confidence nudge things up. Sometimes that’s all you
need to do. Audience Member So how much is this budget service? John Dent It’s unattended, so about £300 for an album. Audience Member For a whole album? John Dent Yeah, it’s time-limited. But Jason is very good at what he does. When you’re working within a workstation that the palette of choices is quite limited, when I’m in my room with all the gear I can be really extreme. But you can’t really do that within the workstation. But if you’re basically happy with what you’ve got and want it tidied up... Audience Member I have two questions. First one, after this wonderful lecture, all of the aspects of dealing with sound and mastering, to me the mastering process
is still a bit of a mystery to me. It still seems like this magic. I don’t know what it is, but it just sounds better. Can you define mastering in a sentence, or is that just impossible? John Dent In a sentence... Audience Member Two sentences. John Dent OK. It’s a presentation. It’s choices and presentation. You can go through a whole process on a computer and it’ll be all digital on a computer and it will lack something. Some people call it warmth and personality. I can get hold of it and simply do something and through my experience it has that something. Part of it is my own personality, my way of
hearing. I’ve listened to so much cable and so many different bits of equipment, I’ve just made choices. I can say, “I won’t have this one, I’ll use this cable.” People come to me out of respect for my choices and they know what they’re going to get is roughly in the
ballpark of what they want. Other mastering engineers take a different approach. It is a presentation, it’s presenting the product for the general consumption. And how you do it can be either as functional or as creative as you make
it. Audience Member So it can be a creative decision. People can say, “OK, I’ve finished mixing my tune, this is how I want it to be presented to the world, I don’t want to master it”? John Dent That’s. That is true, and quite a lot of people do that. Some people do it for a couple of albums, then they get the feedback from people and everyone says actually, “Why’s your album quiet?” And they decide to do the mastering next time. But it is a creative decision. Audience Member Would you define it as getting your songs to be presented on the same level as everything else in the world? John Dent I’ll explain a simple way of viewing this. Say you’ve got an album of ten tracks and you string them all together. They may not relate to each other, but you can play it and enjoy it. If you give that to someone to listen to in the kitchen, in the car or whatever, if they have to keep jumping up, adjusting the volume from track to track, you may think it’s OK, but they
may not decide it’s OK. You take it for granted when you buy a CD that you can put in the player and listen to it. It’s a performance that starts at the beginning and finishes at the end. I’m one of the guys who make sure that that journey is the right kind of journey. I’ve had stuff in from people who’ve done it themselves
that’s been virtually unlistenable because you cannot experience the music as fully as you would if it had been mastered properly. If a track sounds good, there’s no need to master it – five to ten percent fits into that bracket but the rest needs some kind of help. One other thing: The studio has a very flat response reference monitoring
system. If you’re working on your own set up – say, for instance, you’re working with
NS-10s, which have a reputation for being slightly bright, you may be hearing the right top end response in the mix in your room, but when you come to the mastering
recording it’s dull and bass-y. That was a problem when people started using NS10s – you would have a standard 5k EQ boost and a bit of a trim at the bottom end, just to tidy it up. The other way of viewing it is that sometimes the mastering engineer is the only
professional in the chain, especially if you’re doing the work yourself. A lot of record labels like the idea that at least someone is listening to it before it’s released. And we pick up on stuff. We pick up on bad edits and bad sample edits, clicks and glitches within tracks that perhaps people haven’t heard before. I’ll phone someone up and say, “Why’s that loop clicking?” They say, “What do you mean?” When they look it up in their system, sure enough there’s a step in the waveform. We put the spotlight and the magnifying glass on and I listen to every split second of what I do, and that can be quite weird. Audience Member That leads me to my second question – you talk so much about clarity and precision of sound, but don’t you think a lot of great music is created because of unprofessionalism? John Dent Yeah. It’s not really about... You take it for granted that you can hear things. Lots of great tracks are great because you can hear them – at the end of the day it has to be a good performance. I prefer people to literally make music very quickly. I have a problem watching you spend hours and hours, fiddling with beats on a 15-second section of a track. I haven’t got that patience. I would go for a more spontaneous approach. If I was you guys I’d spend the time preparing the tracks
then give them to other musicians and say, “There you are, now give us a performance out of it.” You do hear that in tracks – a lot of the American house tunes have real piano players playing really decent stuff. A lot of people over here just do repeat loops and stuff like that. There’s no rule in terms of creativity, you can do what you want, but it’s whether you’re satisfied three years down the line. If no one listened to it and it could’ve been better, that’s a missed opportunity. It’s very competitive out there. Radio stations will tend to play the stuff that pops out and gets noticed. Benji B Talking of listening to every split second of the record, when talking about the LP experience, are you the guy who decides how much space there is between tracks? The magic two seconds – is there an art to that? John Dent There can be an art to it, yes. Benji B Do you ever get an artist saying there’s too much space? John Dent Yes. I actually think the gaps on some albums are quite important. It gets into your psyche somehow, you know the gaps and when the beat should come in. When Trevor and I put the Legend album together, we got obsessed with the gaps, we held the entire project up because of it. Benji B That’s one of the biggest selling CDs of all time, maybe the gaps helped. John Dent I think they probably did. It’s subtle though. Audience Member You talked about your monitors. What are they? John Dent They’re made by ATC, a company in the west of England. They’re powered monitors, called SCM 100A’s. They suit the room I work in, they fill the room and it’s very easy to hear miniscule changes, one-tenth of a dB changes. I tried other monitors and found that I heard less. They’re plus or minus two dB across the whole range, they’re kind of like giant nearfield monitors. If you scour their website, there’s like a who’s who of ATC monitors. Audience Member You said you prefer to use analog gear, but sometimes you get to digital. What would drive you to digital? John Dent Couple of things: Controlling “s”’s and top end. If I receive a recording that sounds a bit dull and needs a general top-end lift, amongst that you might have vocals that suddenly become a bit too “s”-y. Somewhere in the panel you become aware of something weird happening that’s not very pleasant, so I can nip in
there with a vice unit and gently de-”s” but still retain the top end you want to add. That’s a useful tool. Sometimes when I need to use limiters, maybe on the output I will have maybe one dB of limiting. And I’ve
got a choice of limiters. I’ve got an STC and a finalizer, all sorts of different devices. They all actually sound slightly different. I’ll just choose something to up the level. Sometimes D-to-As sound better if the levels are louder going out of them, whether that’s something to do with the details of what I’m using I don’t know. It may be like a pick-up thing where you need a good energy to start with. I may use a limiter there, but it’s selective and it’s not all the time. Audience Member You reminded me of another question, about this thing where you used to put the clamp on the record. In a live performance I often get feedback with turntables. Does the clamp cause that? John Dent I’ve not tried that, you’d have to try it. I don’t know. Audience Member Let’s say the recession hits hard and people decide not to master their recordings and to survive you have to sell all your studio gear. What three pieces of your gear from your studio would you keep and why? John Dent The lathe. Audience Member Because you don’t want to move it? John Dent Yeah, yeah. It’s just a wonderful piece of equipment. I’d keep the half-inch tape machine because, again, it’s a wonderful piece of equipment. What else? I’d probably keep my monitors so I could listen at home to all the stuff I enjoy. Audience Member Thanks for the lecture, I’ve learned a lot already. You mentioned when you press vinyl you also change the sound and can lose a bit of quality. Is that right? John Dent It can happen, yes. Audience Member Do you anticipate that when you master the music? John Dent I try not to. I have had some projects where the pressing did quite strange things. I did a Steve Winwood album when I was at Island and there was a lot of synths on that album, and some of the high synths had very delicate overtones and when the pressing came back from the factory they had gone, they’d removed them. The high frequencies are the finest, smallest frequencies on the records and the factory can polish the metalwork – they’ll take a cloth and actually polish off some of the high frequencies. So we recut it and added a little bit of high top, second test press came back it was still lost. So, on the third cut we just went berserk and added loads and it came back alright. Sometimes midrange peaks and feedback sounds sound okay on acetate when it’s soft, because the acetate you cut on is soft and bends slightly under the weight of the stylus. But the pressing isn’t soft, it’s rigid, so when it’s on that rigid groove it throws up some other problem which you’re not really aware of. I have heard of engineers in the cutting room spraying the lacquer with coolant to try and harden it to try and mimic the pressing. But I haven’t done that. Audience Member You mentioned you also mastered music that was destined to play in clubs, house and jungle and so on. When I’m in a club and there are 300 people around me screaming and yelling, I am not able to tell if the DJ is playing an mp3 or vinyl. Does that make you think your work has been for nothing? John Dent It’s nice if you’ve got a good record to play, but I can accept the fact that people will choose how to play things. I think the important thing is whoever’s releasing the record, how they feel about it. Audience Member I play vinyl too and my releases only come on vinyl. But still, when I’m on the dancefloor I can’t tell the difference between MP3 and vinyl, so people could ask what the point of having great mastering is. John Dent This goes back to the source files. Benji B And which club you’re going to. Audience Member Most of the people in the club don’t think about it or care about it. Benji B That’s why it’s our job to think about it. John Dent There will be places where you can hear the difference. I can accept that isolated places, you won’t hear the difference. Some of Mark’s stuff, where it comes from 24/96 files, I can guarantee you’ll hear the difference. Benji B We’ve got one of Mark’s tracks that you’ve mastered actually, if you like a little musical interlude. We’ve got before and after? Wicked. What’s this track called? “The Returners.” Forthcoming from Harmonic 313? Warp Recordings, November 2008. [laughs] (music: Harmonic 313 — “The Returners” before and after mastering /
applause) Now I understand why you didn’t want to move to Sydney. So, any more questions? Audience Member Hi. When you get a track and you start mastering it, is there a certain routine that you go through? Do you go to certain bits of equipment first? John Dent No, I just listen to it as it is. I get a feel for what things ought to be. There’s a kind of telepathy that goes on in mastering. People send me stuff and I do something, they might be recording in Colombia or Australia and they’ll say, “How did you know to do that? That’s exactly what I want.” I’ll just pick an
approach, or maybe a couple of approaches, and sometimes I’ll give people choices. I’m doing that on this Franz Ferdinand album at the moment. I’m doing a lot of it unattended. I don’t really know exactly what they want, so I’m giving them maybe a couple of dBs
difference in the levels. The brief on that job was to not hammer the level out of everything, they didn’t want it to be part of this “loudness war,” so we took everything very steady and very dynamic. And then when they turned up to the session, it all got louder. I’m aware they don’t want me to push it, but sometimes I’m not totally sure how they want it, so I do a couple of things. That happens with me – I’ll give a choice back to the customer and they may use one for download and one for CD or vinyl. I don’t have any set way of doing, other than that there is a finite amount of equipment in my room. Audience Member Going back to the loudness question – mainly in pop music, everyone is trying to make their songs as loud as possible and music is getting more compressed. How do you see things in, like, five years? John Dent That’s a difficult one. I think there’s two things going on with this high level stuff, especially if you want to be the hottest band on the block. It’s like a liter of water – you can only put one liter of water in a liter bottle, and CD has a digital ceiling. One of the ways people have got their music noticed is to find clever ways of compressing and limiting and just cranking the whole sound up. If you’re a thrash or a grunge band, heavy metal or whatever and that’s part of your sound, I don’t have a problem with that. But be aware that with any recording there’s a natural maximum level. Sometimes that takes a little while to work out. Sometimes I’ll do something, and perhaps I’ll just leave it for a day and back and decide it’s too loud. That’s common. My first instinct, and I think it comes from my work with vinyl, is to go for a slightly louder thing. But then I’ll rein it back a little bit. It’s like a window. If you rein it back too far, it becomes less interesting. The sound and reverbs go into the background and you don’t have this kind of impact. So there’s a window that does work and I try to work within that window. Audience Member You said only five to ten percent of the material you receive would not need mastering. Has that always been the case or has it changed since the ‘70s? John Dent It’s changed quite a lot. When I first started in studios, I remember receiving a lot of ’60s recordings. They were one-to-one copies of all the masters that had come in – it was like a 15-track album. It was my job to splice all of these copies together, and to my complete and utter surprise it all sounded fine. There were
no level changes required and everything was working to the same level. I think that came from everybody’s training – recording engineers all had fairly formal training – and the equipment was designed to be worked a certain way. You had a VU meter on a tape machine and people worked roughly to zero. You had Dolby A units, which were noise reduction units that took away some of the tape hiss. You had to work those at a certain level. All the
production staff, whatever they did, the music was actually more or less finished and mastered at the mix. The other thing that happened was custom mastering didn’t exist. What you did, you made your recording and you actually sent it to a factory, who would put it on and cut it. Mastering came about – I believe it started more or less in the States – when people realized you could do a little bit more. The first studio I worked at, Trident, they had a cutting room in the main building, so it was a department of the larger studio. Abbey
Road had a cutting room, and Decca. So it has changed a lot through the introduction of digital studio workstations and the lack of use of big recording studios. Benji B Before we wrap up, it would be really valuable to get
Russ [Elevado] involved because yesterday you were talking about the musicians doing their
performance, and when you’re doing the mix, that’s your performance, and if anyone alters it afterwards, then it’s no longer yours. When it’s your baby and you don’t want anyone to touch it, what do you as a mix engineer expect
from the mastering process? Russ Elevado Good question. I get my mix to a point where I’ve worked hours and hours on it and I expect the mastering engineer to really listen to it first and see what the sound of the album is before they start their normal chain. Especially with some of the stuff I do, it isn’t the standard style of mixing anymore, where everything is loud and compressed and really linear. I don’t really want mine louder than everybody else’s. I want my dynamics to stay, and if there’s going to be any sort of tweaking, it should be just a touch low or a touch highs or pulling out the middle a little bit. That’s what I would normally expect from a mastering engineer to do on my albums. Plus, I don’t like putting in L2 or anything. I don’t believe in the end putting this $500 digital compressor once I’ve run the mix through $300,000 of vintage equipment. Benji B How involved are you and therefore the artist in the mastering stage? Russ Elevado If I’ve done the full album – or even half – and if I’m in the same city, then I definitely go to the session and pretty much master it with the mastering engineer. I only use two other people, but I will start using John now that we’ve met. [laughs] I’m there the whole time. The artist will come in and out but I like to stay involved with the mastering, just to make sure he doesn’t mess up the mix. You can mess up the mix just by pulling out a whole dB of a certain frequency. A mastering engineer that’s not as experienced could really ruin the whole vision of the album concept. I’ve got a question though. What’s the process of bringing the level up to CD standard, not making it louder, just a standard way of bringing it up to CD standard? Is it computer processing to get it to that level? John Dent No. I personally can’t stand changing levels in the digital domain. This comes through trying things out time and time again. I remember a long time ago having an acoustic album that needed about five dB of gain, and there were about seven or eight places in my system where I could change the gain by exactly six dB, so thought I’ll see what happens. I set each one and I would have thought theoretically, mathematically, I would end up with six files that all sound exactly the same and to my horror they didn’t. Some files sounded totally incoherent as if it had all fallen apart; others sounded harsh; one wasn’t too bad. At this point I realized this string of numbers, it’s dodgy. I have all my sources in the studio, whether it’s half-inch or digital, and within reason I play it flat. I come out of digital quite often. I have the 24/96 converters that I just like the sound, they don’t sound digitized, they’re very musical. And I tend to do my level changes in analog and I present the A-to-D converter with the correct level for the CD. It goes onto the workstation – all the workstation is there for is editing, fades and presenting the material to whatever media is going to
store the CD in the end. The only thing I will possibly do on the workstation, occasionally I will put in a little bass filter as a plug-in if something pops up in the mix; occasionally you get a thumping on a drum kit. Maybe a few fancy level adjustments if there’s a rather awkward crossfade or something. But I would say as an engineer, 95 percent of my level adjustment has already been done by the time it gets to the destination workstation. Once it’s in there, if it’s already at zero you can’t go any higher, that’s it. The level I set it at is generally by discussion with the client about where they see their project in amongst everyone else’s. Some people go
for very dynamic, some want a kick. I do quite a lot of UK hip-hop, and when you compare it to some serious Dr. Dre levels and stuff, they want to go home and rethink what they’re doing. There are times when you do push the levels, because otherwise they just won’t sound like they mean anything if the levels aren’t right. It depends on the genre and the dynamics. As an aside, I’ve had classical engineers come in and say, “I don’t want my stuff touched, it’s already peaking at zero.” And we’ve put it in the system, transferred it all digitally, no changes. And then I’ve sat down and listened to it and said, “It might peak at zero, but it sounds 15 dB quieter than anything else. Is that what you want?” There’s a big kind of brain strain where they think, “Oh my God, I’ve got to change my sound.” But if you can up it by five dB and it still sounds like more or less where you were originally, then you’re there. The end result is quite big but I approach it in a very minimalist way, so that’s my skill. Russ Elevado In the pro world there’s zero VU. What is it for CD that’s relative to zero VU in the pro world? John Dent Zero VU is normally about minus 14 on the CD scale. Different institutions and different people have a slight variation on that. The reason is you can see a drum beat peaking at zero on a VU meter, but the electronic level could be up to 14 or 15 dB higher than that. There’s a huge difference between the way peak meters read sound. Most digital workstations use standard VU meters, but on some you can switch them to give you a different setting. Benji B One last one? Cristian Vogel What if some of the people here feel the calling to become a mastering engineer? Because there’s inevitably an aspect of engineering – you have to learn how to EQ for yourself – but if you become more interested what you’ve been talking about, the delicate approach and the science or art of mastering, what do you recommend for budding mastering engineers? How can they train, how can they learn? I’ve been mastering for years and I hardly ever get to meet others to talk about different approaches. It’s been really intriguing to hear yours. Is there a school or a standard way of learning? John Dent I’ve not come across a school. I think one of these days I’ll end up writing a
book. Audience Member There are a couple of books, isn’t there? John Dent Bob Katz does some bits and pieces. I think it’s a learning experience in the same way as recording is a learning experience. I had the privilege of coming into the industry at a time when that learning experience was huge. And I’ve been able to look forward and look backwards and just apply sensible engineering techniques and bring the best of what I learned in the past to the current. The best experience is to get into a place that actually does mastering. But it is very, very different. There are engineers that I definitely respect in terms of their work, and they sit there using an audio workstation that I wouldn’t pass a single sound through. Yet they’re there and I respect their work. So it’s definitely a slightly style thing and I suppose you really do have to introduce yourself to places, even ask whether you can be there for a couple of days just making the tea and helping out. I get people coming in quite a lot just to sit around for a day. It gets a bit boring after that, but they come in for a day. Audience Member Isn’t that the clients? [laughs] John Dent They’re generally involved, they like the idea of their stuff going onto tape and the lathe, getting all excited. They’re generally OK. Benji B Are you around for the rest of the day, right? People have got questions, I’m sure, which they can ask over lunch or high tea, whatever the relevant time is now. But for now, thanks to the master, Mr. John Dent.

Krust
Famed as a member of drum & bass supergroup Reprazent and the creator of the massive mid-’90s anthem “Warhead,” DJ Krust is also co-founder of Bristol’s Full Cycle crew, along with Roni Size, DJ Die and Suv. He is loved by fans and peers for his envelope-pushing releases and a rare ability to come on strong while always retaining an infectious sense of funk.
In his lecture at the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy he details his experiences growing up in Bristol and how a love of hip-hop lead him to push the breaks faster.
Hosted by Benji B I’ve been looking forward to this one. Welcome along, Sir. I thought we should start this morning with a little bit of background because you’ve been brought up in sound and started off heavily in the soundsystem and hip-hop thing. I just wondered if you could give us a background, musically, of what age and where it started for you? Krust I saw this film called Wild Style and that really started it off for me. I was about 14 in school and just spiraled from there. I just watched the film, emulated what they were doing, went out and bought the white gloves, started breaking, formed a little crew in school. The school gave us a little room that we could break in, and we had turntables in there and they let us graffiti up the walls and it kind of kept us out of trouble, so that’s where it started. There’s a big musical influence in the family. I’ve got an older brother who had a big record collection so I was always hearing music. Funk, electro, early pop music, The Specials, 2-tone, that kind of thing. So I was listening to it for a while and then after a minute, after the Wild Style thing, I was like, “I’ve got to learn how to scratch.” I needed to learn how to do it so my mum had this old gramophone and it had an on and off button and I used to sit there every Sunday and just learn how to scratch. On and off, on and off. From there it really just went to a youth club that we used to go to called Eagle House and a few of us got together, persuaded our parents to buy us turntables. These really crap ones with elastic bands in them, but they were enough to get us started and we just tried to figure out how to mix and how to scratch and it just got from there. And the crew thing, everyone just watching Wild Style every night, really just trying to copy what these guys were doing and just seeing how that was done. Benji B And what year is this? Krust I don’t know, ‘86, something like that. This is just like at school. I left school probably at ‘84, ‘85. Benji B And where are you from in the world? Krust Bristol. Benji B Bristol, UK. And how did that have a bearing on what you were doing, what you were getting into, crew-wise and soundsystem-wise? Krust Soundsystem-wise Bristol’s got a big cultural background. We have a festival down there called St Paul’s Carnival, and there you have all the different people from all the different backgrounds. They gather around and it’s like a big event over a weekend. You’ve got all these different soundsystems, Smith & Mighty used to do a set there, the Wild Bunch, who are now called Massive Attack, they used to do a sound there and it used to be this big collage of music. You’d hear everything… you’d walk down this one street and there’d be everyone playing everything, from ragga to rock, to Indian music, so there was a big cultural input in the city at that time. So you’d go out in any club, any night, you’d hear a different cross-section of music, so you weren’t subjected to just one vibe all night. You had this big idea of what music was supposed to be, and it wasn’t just one thing… it was a collection of all of those things, and that’s where the ideas were coming from. Benji B And your mum and dad? Their history, their heritage? Krust They’re Jamaican. Benji B And did that have a bearing in Bristol as well, on your soundsystem ethic, or not really? Krust Not really. My mum on a Sunday, she’d get out her Gladys Knight & The Pips, a bit of Marvin Gaye and stuff and, so you’d listen to a lot of soul and funk a lot, it’s in the environment. My brother was into George Benson and then, when The Specials and the mod thing came out started listening to that kind of thing… Fun Boy Three, and then pop music and then electro, Kraftwerk, that type of thing. I was pretty open to music, really. I listened to everything. It wasn’t really, “Don’t like that, I don’t like that.” I listened to everything. Benji B Did you have your own soundsystem? Krust We graduated to that. We ended up buying a couple of speakers similar to those [points to stage speakers] and taking them to youth clubs and going around town in our areas, going to different youth clubs, going to different schools and just playing gigs, just DJing. And competitions, getting our crew and this crew… we had our DJs, they had their DJs. We had our breakers, they had their breakers, and it would just be one of those vibes that you see in the movies. Benji B And your love of hip-hop eventually led you on to do a record, right? Krust Yeah. My brother just drew out a couple of samples one day, put them together on a cassette or on a turntable, and he was mixing them together and just had this idea that he wanted to do a tune. We met up with these guys called Smith & Mighty, they lived in the area, and he sat in the studio for a year with these guys and made this tune. He kept coming back with what he’d done and was like, “OK, yeah, let’s try this, let’s try that,” and we didn’t have a clue really about making music or the production side of things. It was just three or four samples, “Funky Drummer”, Faze-O “Riding High” and another loop I can’t remember. He just put them together, got this girl to come in and she sung over it and then “Bam,” it’s like … “big tune.” Benji B And what was that tune? Krust [Laughs] It’s called “Wishing On A Star” and the crew we formed was Fresh 4. Benji B Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a copy of “Wishing On A Star” to play because it’s not even on Limewire, it’s nowhere, but you need to seek that tune out. You made it on to Top Of The Pops with that? Krust The video did, we didn’t actually go on there. Benji B Top Of The Pops is the weekly pop show in the UK and that tune charted in the top 40, right? Krust It got to number ten. So that was a good look for us. We were 19, 20, we didn’t really understand it. Then, all of a sudden, we’re on the front of magazines and stuff. We were celebrities, we were famous and it can’t last that long. We didn’t really know what we were doing. We got signed to do an album with Virgin. We were like attitude kids from the streets. We were like, “We don’t sell out.” That type of thing. We really didn’t understand the game and how you’re supposed to play it and what you’re supposed to do. What they really wanted was ten “Wishing On A Star,” but we were like, “Nah, we don’t want to do that, we’ve already done it. Let’s do that, let’s do this.” We were supposed to do an album, it never really worked out and eventually we got dropped and back to kicking cans on the street. Benji B What happened? Can you join the dots between that and starting to make music yourself? Krust From that experience, I liked going into the studio. They put us into the studio, they gave us a few pieces of equipment and I liked it. I liked fiddling around with equipment and when that all kind of died down I checked my brother and he had this old Casio FZ-1 sampler. It had 14-second samples and I just went to his house every day for about three years and learnt how to use this sampler and then learnt how to use Cubase and started getting into the production, really. Figuring out how to sample, how to loop, how to use these basic programs and then it just carried on from there. There was a little community, there was Smith & Mighty, Wild Bunch was doing something, there was a few other people in Bristol doing something, passing around programs, teaching each other how to use it. So I just mingled with these guys, then started to hang out with Smith & Mighty more, started to just be the fly on the wall in their studio, really. Just used to go there every day and just stand in the corner, really. Just watched those guys, how they produced, take their techniques and what they were doing and really learnt by observing these guys, listening to the sound and taking those vibes home and trying to figure out how I could use it to what I was doing. Benji B And when did you start to discover the sound that would eventually become yours? When did you start to mess with breakbeat? Krust Well, we used to go to these things… we used to have raves in England where you’d go out in the country. You’d get a phone call or a piece of paper with a number on it, you’d ring the number, they’d tell you where this rave was. You’d drive out to the middle of the country and we used to go out there and listen to this rave music, really. And from there I started to develop an idea of what I was about. I would listen to breaks and beats and a certain vibe in the music, and I’d come back and I’d met DJ Die by now, and I was hanging out with him. So we’d come back and talk about it and we’d start experimenting with beats and breaks and sounds and chopping up beats and breaks, and something was starting to come out. It wasn’t really what was going on but it was kind of something that we were pushing or experimenting with. Benji B What year is this? Early ‘90s? Krust Early ‘90s, very early ‘90s. You’d go to these raves, and most of the night you’d be hearing this techno stuff and then one tune would come out that’d have a break in it or a little vocal in it and we’d be like, “Yeah, I like that.” That was what we were looking for, something with a bit of bass and some breaks. Slowly, we figured out what we liked and how you achieve that. and then we started to make more tunes like it. Then, gradually over time it progressed into this sound, which they were calling jungle techno at the time, and we were like, “OK, cool.” Benji B It seems like a kind of straight lineage from the b-boy ethic of breaks and hip-hop straight through to that? Krust For me, it was all about breaks. It was all about the hip-hop element, the attitude of hip-hop and the production on the beats. I was trying to bring that into what I was doing. In the hip-hop era you’d have Ultimate Breaks & Beats albums when everyone used to scratch up two copies. So, we just used those and sampled the breaks from it, and then sped them up a little bit and we kept on speeding them up. We already had the foundation for the beats because we had a big record collection from cutting up stuff, so we went out and bought fresh copies because the beginnings were scratched out. We already understood breaks and how to use them, so it was just a matter of understanding how we could speed them up and make them work in some of the new music we were making. Benji B Give me some examples of records that you were making at that period? Krust Some of the early V stuff, some of the early Full Cycle stuff. “Music Box” came out about that time but it was in various different stages, a tune called “The Resister” that I did, “Jazz Note”, very early prototype tune, loads of breaks rolling and a lot of jazz influences in it. Benji B So we should stop at this point and explain, because you were to become known best for involvement in Full Cycle records but also meeting Bryan Gee and Jumpin’ Jack Frost was pretty important for you as well? Can you just break down both of those record label things for people that don’t know about Full Cycle or V? Krust Full Cycle was basically started by myself and Roni Size and DJ Die and Suv. And we were just trying to get signed. We had loads of tunes that we had for a couple of years, and we were sending them out to record labels and not getting any response, and it was purely out of frustration that we started the label. It was like, “We’re not getting anywhere, lets figure out how to run a label, how to get this thing together.” And “boom…” That’s how the label was born. Then the meeting with Bryan Gee and Frost… that just came about through a mutual friend who heard one of our tunes, passed it on to Bryan. They were looking to start a label, they were looking for artists and when they heard our stuff they were like, “OK cool,” it sounds like something that they’d get into. The reason why we started our own label as well as going to V was that we had so much material and it all didn’t fit on Full Cycle. Full Cycle at the time was experimental, wasn’t really jazzy but had a jazz element to it, whereas V was a bit more experimental, a bit more of the party bouncy bass vibes. So there was enough to go around at the time. So we put stuff out on V, stuff out on Full Cycle. Benji B And you did eventually do another imprint, Dope Dragon? Krust Dope Dragon came about purely from making tunes for the weekends. We were going to play a rave at the weekend and needed a tune for it so we would go to the studio and make a tune as fast as possible and go and cut it at Music House, that was the place we’d go and cut our dubs, and go and play it that night. We used to call it the “Mission Impossible.” You used to have to make a tune, get to London, cut it and play it that night. That’s how Dope Dragon came about. Benji B It’s interesting that you mention Music House, that’s a cutting house in London. As you know the scene was developing in London simultaneously as you’re doing your thing in Bristol, how much of that was a factor? Be it a problem or a hassle, how was that, being in Bristol and DJing in London every weekend? Krust There was a community building up everywhere, there was stuff up north, Coventry, you had SS in Leicester, you had Doc Scott in Coventry and you had Back 2 Basics in Birmingham, so there was a community building up and everyone converged on Music House. It was a good meeting place, it was a good place to explain music, to exchange ideas, to exchange thoughts. You’d meet people on the scene… this was a brand-new scene that was building up and no one really knew the faces. You’d hear their names but you didn’t really know the faces, so you’d go to Music House and it’d be, “Oh, you’re so and so, you’re so and so,” and you’d exchange tunes, and that was probably one of the highlights of the scene at the time. It was a great communications point, and it was like a youth club, basically, where people would just go every weekend. And as far as just DJing and stuff, me and Roni spent a year sleeping on Bryan Gee’s floor, just to be in London, in the scene, around, to see what was going on. We traveled around the country but London was the place the majority of raves were happening and the majority of people were doing what we were doing so that’s where we had to go, that’s where you had to be. Benji B How did you first meet Roni Size? Krust I knew Roni for about at least six or seven years before I actually met him. I knew him from being in a soundsystem, and Bristol’s a small place so you know everybody. If you’re in the music scene you meet people eventually. So, he was doing a soundsystem, we were DJing and stuff. We broke into this warehouse in this area in town and we needed a PA for it. So, Suv contacted Roni and he brought his PA down and we started to do a regular party, so I started to get to know him from there. But the real turning point came when we all went to Glastonbury [festival] at the same time. [Roni] was a youth worker, he was there with some kids, me and Die just sneaked in and we met up and hung out for a weekend and talked about music. He had lots of tunes that he was working on his studio, we had lots of tunes that we were working on in our studio, and it just made sense that we would get together and join forces and try and make something happen. Benji B But the model that you developed in doing a project with your mates and having a real strong team ethic to what you were doing just seemed so strong throughout the whole ‘90s. For people from the outside looking in, it seemed like a wonderful thing to be able to achieve that. Krust That came from the hip-hop thing. You had a crew and so for us it was like an extension of the other crews that we’d been in. The Fresh 4 thing went as far as it could go, and it became Full Cycle. Same thing with Roni, he was in a soundsystem crew and that probably went as far as it could go and then he joined with us for Full Cycle and it was great. We had fun, we had a laugh, we did a lot of things together, we grew up together, we were always in the studio together for days on end, just chatting, politicking, daydreaming about things that we were trying to accomplish, techniques of making records. We’d get a new sampler and would just bury ourselves in it for days on end, trying to suss it out, trying to work out how it worked, so… yeah, you couldn’t have had a better situation. Benji B And I imagine there was a healthy competition there as well, trying to match tune for tune? Krust Of course, of course. That was the driving force behind it. Someone did a good tune, you wanted to do a good tune as well. That was the real driving force and that’s where a lot of the classics came from, someone going out there and making a tune, you hearing that tune. If you’re screwing your face up and thinking, “Fucking hell!”… that’s what you want to do, you want to make a tune that has that same effect, so you go back into the studio and you sit down and you sized it and you’d do something that’s equally as good as that. Benji B Well, seeing as you mentioned the word classic and screwing your face up, I think you should play “Soul In Motion.” Is this the right kind of era? Krust Yeah, this is about ‘93, ‘94, ‘95, something like that. (music: DJ Krust – “Soul In Motion” / applause) Benji B It’s criminal to cut that tune there’s another four-and-a-half minutes to go, but anyway… That’s just a perfect example of one of those records that you just need to… I used to play that record over and over again and it’d just get to the end and even now it’s like, 11-and-a-half minutes long or whatever, just pick the needle up and put it back at the start and listen to it again. It’s funny, Ben, DJ Zinc, just came up and told me a very interesting little fact that that was the first time that people started cutting on 12” plates because the tune was so long. Is that right? Up until that point it’d all been 10” dubplates, but that was the first time people started cutting on 12” dubplates? What’s always struck me about your music is that there’s that sparse thing but it always takes the full length of the record to get your message across. Has that always been important to you? Krust I wanted my music to be like a film. I had this thing that I would want to make widescreen music, and for me it was about when you watch a film, you don’t normally get it until the end and that’s why I wanted people to listen to the whole track, it was a journey… you had different sections, different stories, the journey went up and down and I wanted to emulate that in the music and I wanted to take people on that journey, on a ride. I was watching a lot of films, I loved movies and I loved epics, the big [films] like Star Wars and Blade Runner, that’s where I was getting my vibe from. I’d sit in my studio with the lights out and just zone out and just do whatever came to me. I didn’t really have any ideas about how it was supposed to sound, I didn’t really care about the length, I didn’t really have any preconceived ideas of what I was trying to get to. I was just trying to let it come out and let the journey happen, as it happened and when it happened. That’s all I really thought about when I was making music and what I still think about now. Benji B When that record came out, it was so different to so much other stuff that was around the time, not just the sparseness of it but the sound effects and the different textures going on in there. You’ve always struck me as someone who’s not really bothered about keeping up with whatever the latest thing is – even within one genre – and just doing your thing. Krust I do what everyone else doesn’t do. Not on purpose, but I just try and be myself. And if you’re yourself, you’re going to be different. That’s why you get some artists that stand out, because they’re really just following their own thing, what they should be doing, and that’s what I try and do, just do what I think I should be doing, and this is what comes out. Benji B You’re totally capable of some dancefloor devastation tunes as well. It’s probably worth playing “Warhead” next up. How long after “Soul In Motion” was it? Krust Same kind of period. Warhead came about because Die and Roni made a tune called “Mad Professor” and it’s a typical example of the competition between us. I heard that tune and thought, “Nah!” I just screwed my face up and was like, “Yeah, OK,” and I went home and in a night, I made that tune, simply because that was like a heavy tune, there was vibes there and I thought, “You know what? I have to make something on that level, that same kind of energy that same kind of vibe.” That’s where “Warhead” came from. Benji B You’re not a stranger to the bottom end… definitely a master of that. That tune was just massive right across the drum & bass community. Krust It took a while. I remember I gave it to Bryan [Gee], and he didn’t get it. He kind of looked at me like, “Really?” I’d been listening to it for three days straight so I got it, to me it made perfect sense. I gave it to a few people, Roni kind of got it and then, eventually, after a while, we were all playing it for a while, and about a year later I think it really took off and the clubs really started to embrace it. I think back in the day it was like a breeding ground with music. You had a tune and you had to mature it. The thing about cutting plates and Music House, you gave it to the men who really understood the tune and they would play the tune and help build the tune. It would be this process of about three to four months. You’d play it and you probably wouldn’t get any reaction, but you’d carry on playing it. After six months, a few people would get it, after nine months people would start requesting it and after about a year, that tune was [released]. And that was the breeding ground of a real classic tune and back in the day that’s how it used to be. People used to ball for the tune; it was a natural thing, and I think that’s changed a little bit now. Benji B For some fans of the music, that’s no bad thing because people used to have to wait two years to buy some of the music you were playing. Is it a bit quicker now? Krust Sometimes you do a tune in one week, and you can get it out in two weeks, three weeks, everyone’s playing it off mp3 very quickly. I think it’s just a sign of the times, there’s an urgency and a need now to get your music out and not to really be that exclusive anymore. I don’t think there’s a need for that anymore, especially with the networks now, and the community’s so big now, whereas before it was like 28 labels and there were a handful of DJs. Now it’s like 128 labels and you’ve probably got 200 DJs, so there’s a lot more access to distribute your music now. (music: Krust – “Warhead”) Benji B How long, almost ten years now that tune? And what were you making that music on? What kind of equipment were you making that music on? Krust That was a 760 Roland sampler, Atari sequencer and a shitty little fucking 12-track desk. That was it. I had no proper equipment, I couldn’t even use it properly or EQ. Didn’t understand that, just get a couple of breaks, layer them on top of each other. The bass… that’s from me touching the wire and then sampling it. That’s where the bass came from. I was trying to plug something in and I just touched it and it went “brrr” and I was like, “Right.” Pressed sample [applause]. Benji B A lot of the music I hear now doesn’t have that warmth, doesn’t have that ruggedness. Krust The switch-over to digital… analogue sound is a lot warmer traditionally and I think the digital switch is convenient because you’ve got instant recall, but you have to sacrifice something for it. You could compare a lot of the tunes from back then and now – technically it’s unmatched, you can’t beat it, but you lose something, a little bit of warmth, the bass is a bit more warm, the beats are a bit grittier and stuff. I think now there’s a trend of moving back towards that now, especially in our scene anyway where we’re trying to understand how to get the best of both worlds. You can’t get away from the digital thing. You need it, the quality of it and the spontaneity… you need that, but the other side of it is, you listen to tunes like that and how they sounded… I do it all the time; I compare a lot of my tunes to a lot of my old tunes and I’m trying to make my music sound more like this now, where it’s a bit warmer and fatter and… it’s an ongoing struggle. Benji B And what are you using now? What did you use for the last record? Krust On the last album, I’ve got ProTools for sequencing and I did have a Mackie desk, I’ve got rid of it now. But I went back, I used the 760 sampler and a new Roland sampler, keyboard and stuff. I tried to make the last album… I did in the essence of what I got my best results in. I listened to all my tunes, I put them on a CD, like “Soul In Motion,” “Warhead,” “True Stories,” I put about ten of my favorite tunes that I did, I put them onto my iPod, and I listened to them for about six months. I wanted to get back into the spirit, back into that essence, back into the vibe of how I used to make music. Because of the technology it’s like, “Yeah, let’s get this new plug-in, let’s get this new thing.” And it got to a point where I was like, “Hold on a minute.” I used to make tunes with a fucking 14-second sampler and one broken speaker and a dodgy turntable and I was getting blinded by the technology. Technology is here to help us, to get to somewhere it doesn’t replace that. You people use the computers now, and you’ve got endless amounts of sample time in there, endless plug-ins, all these presets and all these standard sounds and I went, “You know what? I have to get back to what’s really me.” So, I sat down, listened to my tunes, listened to what I was about, and got my sampler out. Sat down, got my old samples out, started to listen to them again, got all my old records out, started to listen to them again and thought, “OK, let me just get back to what I do best.” And I just sat down and started to sample again. Spent two days sampling, two days editing, two days making sounds, three days chopping sounds up, making basses again. I was like, “OK, cool, I know what I’m going to do, I know what I’m about now.” Benji B So, it’s fair to say that some of the most beautiful things come from the most limited means? Krust I think that you are forced to do things you don’t normally do when you haven’t got the resources to do them. It’s all about being creative and having imagination. You really are stuck, and what happens when you don’t have the resources you need it makes you be creative? It makes you think in another way. How can I make this sound like that, how can I make this sample sound like that? We discovered the art of sampling on one-and-a-half seconds. Our first sampler had 14 seconds, you had to use it wisely. You’d make a whole tune in 14 seconds, that takes a lot of skill. Really understanding a break. All you need of a beat is two-and-a-half seconds. And you loop it and you learn how to make a loop. The 760 is great, before that we had the 550, and the 330, and they had functions on there where you could loop forward, loop backwards, loop and continual loop so it had all these different things on it. So, we’d have one beat doing loop forwards, loop backwards, continual loop, so in a track you’d have different mixes of the same beat looping at different start points. We got creative that way. Same thing with basses. You’d have a bass, which would go one way then the other way, and you’d do a fill. We got in deep, that’s all we had, 14 seconds… you had to understand how to use that and get the most out of it. Benji B So, would you recommend if people get creative block to just bring it back to basics? Krust Do you know what I’ve done? Got rid of all my shit. I’ve gone back to basics, gone back to how I used to make music. Got rid of my desk, got rid of all this other stuff, all these modules I’d bought. I sat in there and saw all these modules and thought, “Where do I start? I’m going to try and do this, try and do that,” and I thought, “You know what? Make life simple. Go back to the simplest way that you can make music and start from there, have a start point.” For me, it was about sampling records and a sampler and my Atari so I’ve gone back… I haven’t gone back to the Atari, that’s too far back, but I’ve gone far as back as I can go back and still be current as well. Benji B So, let’s move on to the Reprazent era because I think that’s definitely worth talking about and how you came up with the concept with Roni and Die and Suv for Reprazent, and Dynamite [MC], of course. When did that idea start forming? Krust We got approached, first of all, by Paul Martin and Gilles Peterson from Talkin’ Loud. But before that we actually got approached by James Lavelle at Mo’ Wax. We did a remix for him and then we did a remix for Gilles and it was on the cards, we almost signed to Mo’ Wax. And then James longed it out a bit and Gilles, they were a bit more on point and so we signed with them and that whole thing just came about from trying to go to the next level. We were always about trying to make another tune that was better than the last one, trying to do concepts that were better than the last one. So, on Full Cycle we did a couple of compilations and stuff and we were building towards something, we had a collection of tunes and then we got signed and it was like OK. We all sat around and discussed how the project was going to be and how it was going to go and we were fortunate in that we already had Dynamite on board and then we met Onallee the singer, she’s a local Bristol girl, and the whole thing just grew organically, really. Roni was the main architect of that project, but we’d come in at different stages of the project and give some input and say how certain things could be and what not. “Share The Fall” was one of the big tracks on the project, and that was a case of us sitting down, all talking about this tune and really that just happened, it was like a section from here, section from there, that was a real big experimental tune that just came together. So, that’s the whole point, it just grew out of different pieces of tracks here and there and then the project just kind of went together, really. And then the live thing came from trying to work out how to perform it live and how we were going to do it. We didn’t just want to be DJing the project, we wanted to form a band and actually go out there and actually play it. We didn’t have an idea of how to do it… it hadn’t really been done before in the way that we did it so we had to work out how to get the samples and play them live and get the drummer to play in time. We used a guy called Clive Deamer and he’d never played at 170 before so he’d be trying to keep up and we’d play him records and stuff and say, “This is what it sounds like, this is what you have to do.” It took him a while, and fair play to him he got it – Clive Deamer was Portishead’s drummer, so he’s gone from 100bpm to 160bpm. It was a bit of a culture shock for him, but he got it. And then we had Si John, the bass player, he was from Bristol, and we just spent eight months in the studio, rehearsing and jamming and trying to put this thing together with these ideas and these vibes and stuff. And eventually, it came together after about three years. Benji B It’s easy to forget now but I remember that first Jazz Café gig that you did and until that point no one had really seen drummers doing Drum & bass. And also there weren’t a great deal of song songs around, loads of records with samples and stuff but not a great deal of songs. In many ways it was an extremely innovative thing to do. Now, it just seems normal, you always see drummers playing drum & bass or whatever, but that really broke the mold in a lot of ways. Did you have fun touring it as a band, was it a laugh? Krust Oh, for real. It was like school camp for about three years. We were on a bus, traveling around America, traveling around Europe, meeting people… you couldn’t have dreamt of it. It was beyond everything that we thought we were ever going to do, and it was great. It was a great adventure and it was probably one of the greatest parts of my life, hanging out with your friends all of the time, touring, going all around the world, it was crazy. Benji B And I think it’s a pretty interesting model to talk about, Reprazent getting signed, because, as with many underground scenes there comes a point, maybe a tipping point, where major record labels or whatever vehicle it will be in the future, start to sniff around. I remember in the mid-’90s, certainly with drum & bass, all the majors were starting to sign people up one-by-one… You did it in a really interesting way, because you all signed to a major but without using any of your names. So you signed Reprazent but still you could do records as Krust or Suv or Die or Full Cycle or V [Records]. Krust What actually happened is that they signed the project as State Of Mind. So, they didn’t actually have the name Reprazent or any of our other names. That was an oversight of theirs or undersight, I guess, and it kind of worked in our favor. We suddenly realized that they didn’t own any of our names and we weren’t contracted not to do it. Benji B So, it wasn’t actually a conscious decision on your part? Krust No, we just never had a name. We were playing with the idea of State Of Mind at the time and that’s what we signed under and then we came up with Reprazent afterwards. Benji B And how do you feel that intervention of the major labels or the mainstream, or however you want to phrase it, affects a scene? Krust Nothing can stay underground forever. I think that just by things progressing in a certain way it’s going to grow. You’re going to get attention from certain people and I think in our case we were quite fortunate we had a lot of creative control. No one told us what to do and we did an extension of what we were doing on our own label anyway, so it was a natural thing and because we were working with Talkin’ Loud, we were working with Gilles and Paul, they were quite mellow and relaxed, they let us do exactly what we wanted. We were quite fortunate, we kept it on that level, but majors are always going to be sniffing around what’s new. They always want to know what’s new, they always want to be at the cutting edge of what’s new and say they were the first to do it. I think it’s up to individuals to see how they can profit from it. For us, it worked because we were able to take the music that was created in the streets of England and go and tour in Japan, Australia, in America, and all of a sudden the music became bigger and more worldwide and more well-known, but it was still underground in England. It was still underground in all these places we were going to. Even though we were signed to a major, we were still going to play to a thousand people in America – it wasn’t as if we were going to play these massive stadiums, it was still quite underground at that time, still quite elusive, still quite cool. Majors… they didn’t really understand. It was only Paul and Gilles who understood what it was, the majors didn’t really get it, they couldn’t understand it. Benji B Did they understand it a bit more after you won the Mercury prize? Krust Well, it made perfect sense then. It was a vehicle for them to make money and from their point of view, that’s all they want. The record industry, when you get to that level is quite simple, you either sell a shitload of units or you don’t. And once you understand the language of their game, once you understand the language of recoup, it’s a whole different ball game. Benji B And how did that affect your situation? Krust Recoup? Benji B Were you savvy to that before you went into it? Krust I was lucky that I had the experience of Fresh 4 so I kind of understood it. I knew Simon from back then our manager, Simon Goffe, so it was just a natural thing for me to get him involved, I had a relationship with him already so it was like a phone call, “OK, Simon…” He got involved before all that anyway because we were getting to a certain level that we couldn’t manage any more. We needed a bit of professional help, we were getting into a situation where the label was getting a lot of interest from publishers, so we had to figure out how to run a business now. It wasn’t just about making records and having fun, doing all the other things… now it’s a case of there’s money coming in, you need to have an accountant, you need to have proper management and you need to know what to do with this money, how to manage it, do contracts. And all of a sudden, it got serious, it wasn’t fun any more, for a minute. You ended up being in meetings with record companies and getting contracts that thick that you couldn’t understand, and you had the manager who wanted 20% so you learn all this new language and it was like, “OK, this isn’t just about sitting in the studio and making tunes all night.” Now we had to put our thinking caps on and think, “OK, this is what it’s really about, if we’re going in this direction.” And, in a way, it naturally went there, we didn’t look for any of this, it was just the fact that the records were selling more, we were getting more attention, we were playing more gigs, there was more money coming in, we signed off of the dole, we started to make… [to participants] the social. You get social in England, so we signed off the dole and we started to get regular agencies and we had to start paying tax and VAT. And, all of a sudden, it’s a business now and someone had to come in and show us how to do this thing properly. So, with all that in mind, it’s a different ball game. You have to get professional, you have to go into these meetings and try and understand what these people are talking about. Eventually, you get it and eventually you learn and you make mistakes along the way. Benji B And how does all that affect your own label, the smaller label up the road that you’re still running and your relationship with all the people there? Krust We benefited from it because on all the stuff that came from Talkin’ Loud, we had a Full Cycle logo on there and we directed everybody to our website and our merchandise, so that was the good part of it. As well as touring as Reprazent, everybody knew we were from Full Cycle so we used that as a vehicle to promote our own business. And one thing we did… we learnt very early how the majors worked. We studied it, we scienced it, we talked to everybody in the industry, we spoke to the press people, we spoke to the promotions and we really scienced it and tried to understand how it works, tried to understand the language and made a lot of friends and a lot of contacts in there and we just used it on our own imprint. Just modelled it, really. When the whole thing ended we had a saying, “This is what they do, this is what we’re going to do.” We want to sell units? We do it this way. We want to get press? We go and do that, we go and do this way. There are certain principles in the business you have to emulate, and if you stick to the principles, you’ll do what you need to do, but in amongst those principles you can be flexible and you can still be creative and you can still do certain things. You’re in the business of distribution, you want to get your music out, so you get your music out. Benji B And if you had to pick a couple of principles – three principles – for people that don’t want those pitfalls, for people that even though they’ve been told it a hundred times, just a couple of things, you don’t have to be specific. Krust Only get a manager when you can’t do the business yourself, that’s a standard thing – don’t just go out there and get a manager. Second of all, don’t get it twisted; the people you meet along the way aren’t your friends. You have your friends in your crew, and that’s it. If you meet them along the way, they know you through the business, so keep it business. Try and be as professional as possible. Always get it in writing and always get it checked over. Be as professional as possible, as much as you can. Benji B Earlier you were talking about the expansion of the scene and how it went from something small to something big. And drum & bass is a beautiful example of how something that was very localized has become totally global. For a number of years, people outside of the inner circle of drum & bass producers and DJs could be forgiven for thinking that it was a closed shop in terms of the way that it seemed to be a club… like you say, Music House and all of that whole thing… Where was the tipping point where suddenly people were accepting people making tunes in America, or accepting people making music from outside of the UK, from Asia or Australia and where your sound and involvement in Reprazent and all of that stuff… when it exploded? Krust I think that it just gradually got that way. DJs started to go abroad, people started to go to Germany, France, places around Europe, and gradually it started to build up and you started to go a bit further, to Japan, and then people were going to America. So slowly, it began to just spread out. People were starting to hear about it from other scenes. I think from different walks of life, people from hip hop, people from house, people from jazz, they recognized the elements in it and it expanded from there. From our point of view, from Reprazent, we were fortunate that we actually got put into different scenarios, we were playing to typical jazz audiences. When we got on the road, our first tour was with Galliano, Shawn Lee and Karime Kendra, so we were playing with, like a rock band. Galliano, jazz-fusion… and it was us – jungle – playing these festivals. It was different. I remember when me and Dynamite toured with a rock band in America called Soul Coughing and the drummer, who’s a friend of mine now, his name is Yuval Gabay… he was in London and he picked up this tape. He’d heard about jungle and he’d bought this tape, and it had some jungle on it, so he took it back to his band in America and he played it to them and they were like “OK…” They could hear it. He was like, “I want these guys to come and tour with us.” So, we went to America and opened up for this rock band, and it was crazy. We were playing at some places and we’d go there and we’d start playing, and people would just come in and be like [mimes unimpressed face] for about a good 45 minutes and it was hard work, very intimidating. You’ve got these hardcore rock fans listening to you playing this uptempo music, looking at you like you’re in the wrong club. But after about an hour of it they would slowly come round and we saw it for about 12 nights – it was exactly the same thing. First 45 minutes everyone would be just standing there watching us, and then after an hour they’d try and work out how to dance to it. But Dynamite was showing them, he’d be up on stage showing them how to dance and, slowly but surely, they’d be getting into it. That for me was a real eye-opener into how the music was crossing over. People who didn’t have any idea about what it was could potentially get involved and hear it and maybe like it’s music they’ve never actually heard. I saw something on that tour of those people and that opened my eyes to it and that’s how the music generally went. Say, if we went to Japan. When we went there… the first time we did Reprazent there, we played and we’re Reprazent and we had this reaction where we’d play and everyone would go mad, the crowd would go mad. Went to Japan, played the first song and everyone just stood there. But that was just the Japanese, they didn’t really go mad, didn’t really react, and then we went there a couple of years later and it’d all changed and they’d really got into it. So, throughout the whole sort of five-year period of when everyone first started to go away to maybe when it started to get really big, there was a big change – everyone started to see and understand this music and really get into it, and people started to make it from their own point of view like the Americans and some Europeans. That’s only really happened in the last four to five years, really. But that’s what happens. You make music, people emulate it like we were emulating hip-hop back in the day, that’s what happens. So, the American cats are doing the same thing, but now it’s kind of cool, they’ve got their own vibe of it and same thing with everywhere else they’ve got their own vibe of it and it’s on the level right now, it’s good. Benji B So the Reprazent thing kind of took a breather or naturally came to a halt for a minute and you did another record… you did your solo record? Krust I did a solo album, Coded Language. Benji B And the title track of that was featuring… Krust Saul Williams. I had the original track of that just made and I didn’t really know what to do with it. I knew I wanted a vocal on there, but Gilles and Paul Martin, they knew this cat Saul Williams and they suggested that we meet and I brought the track… He already had this whole thing written out on this fucking scroll thing that he just recited one day and it was like… I’d never heard anything like it and the next day we went into the studio and we put the track down and that became the title track of the album. Benji B Let’s check it. (music: Krust feat Saul Williams – “Coded Language” / applause) Benji B So, where are we at now? What are you up to in the present day? Krust Now, I’ve just finished the new album called Hidden Knowledge – that came out earlier this year on Full Cycle – been putting a band together, rehearsing with them for the last couple of months and we did our first show last week in Cargo [in London] – that was fun. So, really just getting this live thing together, getting the band tight, rehearsing, getting the next project together. Benji B And the new album is out? Krust The new album is out in the shops now, it’s called Hidden Knowledge, on Full Cycle. This is from the new album, it’s a track called “Belief System”… Benji B Let’s check that out now, just to get an idea. (music: Krust – “Belief System” / applause) I mean, evidently, the deeper sound of the music has always been your thing, how do you feel about the state of music generally… in electronic dance music at the moment, but also your scene and your ability to keep making music within that? Krust I think the music scene’s interesting right now. There’s a lot of music, and just being here this week, I’ve heard some fucking outstanding music. People have brought stuff and recommended stuff, and I’m happy with the scene. In drum & bass right now, it’s getting good, it’s getting exciting and there’s some cats out there really pushing it again. Some exciting stuff, some new cats coming through with some new techniques and it’s getting healthy again. Everything moves in cycles, so I think we’ve gone through one and we’re going back to the music side of things again, the jungle side of things again, the big basses, the unusual arrangements, the dropping the unexpected drops, and it’s good, exciting. Benji B And in your own life, what cycle are you at in terms of creating, moving… life stuff? Krust Caught me off guard there, bruvv. Whatever man, I’m just following my own thing, really. I’m trying to just have fun, trying to create, trying to just explore different things in the music and in life, just trying to go forward, trying not to do the same things over again. With my music, I try and see what’s next. I think it’s been good that I’ve been involved in the music and in the label and that we’ve been able to keep on pushing each other and go forward and keep building on stuff, and I think having a good core solid group around you who are on the same wavelength helps because we can keep each other in check and say, “Let’s do this, let’s do that,” and we keep on building so the label’s starting to progress. We’ve got Full Cycle TV, which is like us from the film and stuff we did for Reprazent… it’s taken on a life of its own. We’ve gone out and shot documentaries on people that we really admire in the music, and got their take on the history of their music, just to see where our musical backgrounds come from, so were really excited about that. That’s one of the new projects that were doing and we’re starting a downtempo label as well so we can explore the variety of the music we’re into. For us, we’re going back to our roots in a sense. We came from the downtempo thing and we’ve explored the drum & bass thing and we’ll still explore it, but as well we’re getting back into the downtempo thing, there’s a real pull to that. Die’s just done this new project with Ben Westbeech, Roni’s just done a project with Vikter Duplaix, I’m working on a project with my brother from the Fresh 4 era. So, growing up, moving on, exploring new territories and seeing what else is out there. Benji B How do you think we’ll be experiencing music in ten years’ time? Krust It’s interesting. I think the formats will just keep on changing and I’ve heard of crazy stuff. Optical drives and stuff with music on lasers and hard drives and stuff and… I don’t know where it’s going. I heard something the other day where someone said it’s going to be beamed directly into peoples’ heads. That’s already kind of happening, there was a disabled guy, who was disabled from the neck down, and they put a chip in his head and he sent the first email by thought. So the technology is there for these things to be available and it’s just a matter of time before it becomes available to the general public. Anything is possible. I just use the technology. Benji B And you’ve been studying recently, beyond the technology? Krust I’ve been getting into consciousness. My last album was called Hidden Knowledge and it was based on the stuff that I’d been studying. I’d been studying a lot of consciousness and spirituality, and that’s been the driving force in my life as well as the music. So, I’ve been combining the two things together through the last couple of years, and it was a real conscious decision to say, “Let’s make this project around the subject. Let’s call it Hidden Knowledge, let’s talk about the subjects that aren’t readily available.” Every track on the album is titled with a name you could go deeper into, if you really wanted to, and find out more information and get knowledge. I think that we’re at a point in time now where we’re all looking for something, and we’re all looking for some answers to questions that we really don’t get from the mainstream. So, I just did what I do with my music and put something out there. On the CD there’s information, there’s websites to look for, just to gather information. I think that if someone knows something about something they should teach someone else about it. That’s where I’m coming from, that simple analogy “each one, teach one” is why I’m in this music and what I’m about right now. Benji B Amen.

Kutcha Edwards
Kutcha Edwards is a member of the Stolen Generations, a member of the Matimati people, aboriginal Australians, removed from his parents at 18 months. He began a music career as an adult, inspired partly by seeing the legendary bluesman Robert Cray. At first he joined the band Watbalimba before forming Blackfire, a group composed of aboriginal people who sung of their struggle. In 2002 he released his debut solo album, Cooinda, named after the children home he was put into by the government.
In conversation the 2006 Red Bull Music Academy, Edwards sat down to discuss the cold hard truths of colonialism’s legacy and give sobering insights into the lives of Aboriginal Australians.
Hosted by Jeff “Chairman” Mao Our next guest, I think it’s very appropriate that we have him here. He’s a singer-songwriter, highly respected here. He is also an activist and he’s come to speak a little bit about his career. Won’t you please give a warm welcome to Mr Kutcha Edwards [applause]. Kutcha Edwards Is this working? It is. Jeff “Chairman” Mao How are you doing today, sir? Kutcha Edwards I’m good, Jeff. We were talking before. The opportunity for you [points to audience] as singer-songwriters, musicians, people within the industry itself and what is music, and what can it do. For me, music is more than just the audio and the sound that resonates. It’s an opportunity for me, obviously being this color, in this country, and people sort of try to suggest that it’s not like that. Even sitting in this audience, and only seeing one other black man, person, is difficult. In introducing me Jeff, I have to acknowledge that me being not born of this country, Melbourne, I have to acknowledge the traditional owners of Melbourne, the Wurundjeri people, in their customs and their beliefs, because if I don’t do that, as an indigenous person of this country, I’m not adhering to laws and protocols that have been here not for 217 years, since Captain Cook sailed in his “great endeavor.” I am a descendant of peoples of this country for over 100,000 years. I have to acknowledge that of country. I might as well go straight into my talk, huh? Jeff “Chairman” Mao I don’t want to assume knowledge, necessarily, of some of the history, so if you want to try to synopsize that a little bit for everybody, so they have an understanding… Kutcha Edwards To understand why I have got the opportunity today, to talk in front of you, you need to understand where I have come from. I’m a proud Muthi Muthi man. Not from this state, Victoria. I’m from near South Wales, born on the Murrumbidgee River, which flows into the Murray, which the Murray flows into South Australia. The Coorong in South Australia. Before I actually start, I want to give you an understanding. [stands up, picks up a box, walks toward the audience] Is there anybody, willing to put their watch, or their wallet, or their phone in this box? Now. Can you do it? Are you willing to do it? Audience Member Yeah. Kutcha Edwards You’re not getting them back. Can I have it? You’re willing to put your phone in there? Audience Member Can I get the numbers out? Kutcha Edwards No, you can’t get the numbers out of it. Honestly, you’re not going to get your phone back or your wallet. Audience Member It’s for you. Kutcha Edwards I’ll own them, and I’ll do what I please with them. Audience Member I’ll give you my watch. Kutcha Edwards Your watch? Audience Member Yeah. Kutcha Edwards Not many people are willing to do it, why? Can somebody answer me? Why are you not willing to hand over a watch, a phone, a wallet? Can somebody explain why? Audience Member Because belongings. Kutcha Edwards Belongs to? Audience Member To the individual. Kutcha Edwards OK. Did you hear that? Could you give that answer again? Audience Member It doesn’t belong to you. Kutcha Edwards It belongs to the individual, the owner of what is in here. Audience Member Yeah. The value. Kutcha Edwards The value of it. The value of a phone is what? 100 bucks. Audience Member Maybe messages in there from an ex-girlfriend. Kutcha Edwards That’s why you want her back. Yeah, well that might be why I want it! My mother and father had to hand over six children, me being 18 months old, and we’re worried about a watch. Or a phone. How’d that feel, guys? Because of politics, and because I was born this color, in this country, my mother and father had to hand over six children. I was born in 1965. Then 1967 comes along, gives indigenous people, Aboriginal people, the opportunity to become citizens, finally, in our own country that we’ve been in since time began. Or because the white man says, “OK, we’ll let you become citizens in your own country.” Do you know what, we were part of the Flora and Fauna Act of Australia. So we were considered alongside trees, shrubs, animals and dirt. What a load of shit. We get protective over a phone, a watch, and a wallet. What are our most prized possessions? They’re our children, and my mother and father had turned over six. It burns to my core, even today, having to explain to visitors to this country, what is really happening in this country. Rips my freaking heart out. But I do it so that the world understands what is really happening in this country. When I had the opportunity, Wolf called me or I called him and said, “Yep, I’ll do it.” For you to not only listen to me, and get an understanding of where my music is coming from and where it’s going, it gives me the opportunity to tell the world, the reality, of what is happening. That is why I jumped at the opportunity. At 18 months old, put into a children’s institution in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and there I lived for 11 years in a dormitory sort of setting, with a lot of other non-indigenous kids. Having to do so, when you’re forcibly removed from your mother and father, you are not only taken away from that setting, you’re taken away from your traditional lands. You’re taken away from what makes me Aboriginal, my knowledge, of not only my lineage to my forefathers, like I’ve said that have been here. I am a direct descendant of two skeletons that were found in a place called Lake Mungo, in New South Wales. Muthi Muthi people, my clan, are the southern caretakers of Lake Mungo. They found two skeletons, that were carbon dated to over 60,000 years old. I am a direct descendant to those bones, to those people. I am so proud of that fact, yet in the white man’s eyes, I am only 40 years old. How hypocritical can that be? Now, I saw my mother when I was six years old for the very first time. She came to the children’s home where I was, and I was at primary school and I had to run all the way home to this cottage. I saw my mother, and I didn’t know who she was. It took her seven years to convince authorities that she has the right to have her children back, so I went to live with her. I lived with her for five years, and in that time, they were probably the hardest five years of my life. Your mother and father are supposed to know every characteristic that you have. They know what time you usually get up, Jeff, don’t they? Your mother and father, when you’re living with them. They know what you love to eat and what you don’t love to eat. Who your friends are, who your enemies are. My mother knew nothing. People would look at me and suggest, “Kutcha, you are Aboriginal, why don’t you speak in native tongue?” Because Aboriginal people were denied to speak it. Our own language. Who speaks a language other than English here? That’s great, man. The only language I know is English. The worst tongue ever known to man, English. George Bush speaks English. John Howard, the idiot speaks English. I went to live with my mother, and they were hard. They came down to Melbourne in 1985 and I went to a school not much different than this, but it was a school that taught us not only about how to become a nurse, so I’m a qualified nurse, but they taught us the politics of what makes an Aboriginal. Once I found out the policies of why I was put into a children’s home, I saw red… I turned on society itself. But I started abusing from within, internally. I started delving into heavy shit, drugs and alcohol and rebelling against society itself. This all came to a head eight years ago. I had a heart attack and it was a scare for me. Music, I suppose has soothed the beast inside Kutcha Edwards. Along with friends of my who are well known, Paul Kelly. Paul Kelly came to the school two weeks ago. Paul Kelly is a very dear friend of mine. Paul Kelly actually produced this album here, Cooinda. Cooinda was the children’s home that I was in. I wanted to name it Cooinda for that fact. To let people know and start debate, “What do you know in Cooinda?” “Well, Cooinda was the children’s home.” “Oh, I didn’t know you were a children’s home.” That starts debate. Jeff “Chairman” Mao When you went to the children’s home, this being the government policy, to remove the Aboriginal children from the families, you went to an integrated children’s home. What was that like amongst the children? Kutcha Edwards I lived in Cooinda, the cottage itself. There was about ten different cottages. Orphans, I suppose. We got told when we were kids that, “Your mother and father are dead and this and that.” They talk shit. They deny you the truth for their own gain. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Did you sense, even at that age – you were quote/unquote orphans – but I guess, there were white orphans amongst there as well? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Did you sense that they had any sort of acknowledgement or was it different? Kutcha Edwards You’re living for the day, for the moment, you don’t understand that this was all a politically motivated policy. It is proven to this day that Australia had two policies enacted… To be honest, South Africa adopted policies from here, from Australia. Australia had policies after the Second World War, the White Australia Policy. No African or Asian was to immigrate during that time to Australia. There was also the White Australia Policy and the Assimilation Policy, where Aboriginal children were forcibly removed because of the interbreeding, I suppose. If there’s an overseer at one of the missions who has his way with any woman he likes, in the way that he likes, of course there are going to be children of mixed color. Then children were forcibly removed. My mother and father are as black as me, but because of the policies at the time, they forcibly removed children that they thought weren’t being looked after… used it as a tool to do what they wanted. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Your sort of awakening, as far what had happened to you, came when your mother found you, correct? Kutcha Edwards My mother found me when I was six years old. First saw me when I was six and then I went to live with her when I was 13. To be honest, I was in a choir at primary school. I loved singing in a choir. To be honest, I fell into music. Every time I got drunk, every time I got shitfaced, I’d be singing. People would say, “Kutcha, why don’t you start a band?” I started singing in this band called Watbalimba. Watbalimba is a eastern state down Gippsland way, a Kurnai Gunai word, an Aboriginal word for dance. Watbalimba was the band name. I started performing in this Aboriginal band, singing English, but singing about the Aboriginal struggle. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What sort of music would you describe that as? Kutcha Edwards It was, I suppose rock music. There were about 11 men in this band, but 11 freaking egos too. We were always arguing… I’m somewhat of a lyricist who likes to take control of what we’re going to sing about. That band fell on its ass and didn’t last for very long. Then I had a few experiences in… I had a band Blackfire. Blackfire was a band that sang about the struggle of indigenous peoples and that’s where the activism started to come and we were writing about “give us back our land.” Anybody here heard of a band called No Fixed Address? You heard of No Fixed Address? No Fixed Address was a very famous band here in Australia by a guy named Bart Willoughby. Bart Willoughby is a drummer and his band, No Fixed Address, was the first band to put the foot in the door. Not only put the foot in the door, but to kick the freaking door down and say, ”We’re not taking it anymore. We’re going to stand up.” It was a move towards using music as this activist tool. Actually the very first concert that I ever went to, I wasn’t much of a person for concerts, I went and saw Robert Cray at a place called Festival Hall in east Melbourne. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Blues guitarist. American blues guitarist Robert Cray Kutcha Edwards Yeah. The Strong Persuader tour, and his music just kicked me in the face. I went home and wrote my very first song. It was a blues song called, “Roll With The Rhythm.” I haven’t actually got it here today, but I went home and wrote “Roll With The Rhythm.” I remember the very first poem that I wrote. I was in secondary school, in high school. Humanities teacher said, “Kutcha, can you write a poem?” And I wrote this poem and I look back at this poem, everybody looks at life in hindsight and I look at this poem and I think was 13 years old… It goes, “Trickling down a waterfall, freely one by one, forming into clouds of spray glistening in the sun, crushing to disaster, my water drop is done, left the short life of loneliness and gathered back as one.” I sort place of myself as that one drop. Being with my family, separated, but then in hindsight, coming back. I’m one of 12 kids, by the way, I’m ninth in line. I lost a brother last year to alcoholism and he was very close to me in the children’s home. We look at people, all of us, we look at suicide as being this quick answer to a problem that’s been pestering us for – I suppose forever. I look at alcoholism as the same thing. It’s a prolonged approach to the same situation. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You said Robert Cray was your first concert. Previous to that, I’m sure you heard music. On the radio, did you… Kutcha Edwards I remember listening as a kid to this beautiful, soulful sound of Karen Carpenter. Karen Carpenter, obviously we’ve all heard her beautiful tone and her beautiful… the lyrics were a bit weird for me, but that’s Richard’s doing. She had this great, this great tone. But you’ll hear when I sing that the resonant... Songwriting for me is this, I was explaining to Jeff before that now, I suppose as a songwriter and a lyricist, I go into juvenile justice centers, jails, schools and talk about, I suppose, my experiences and my experiences with songwriting. Are we ready to… Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you want to play? Kutcha Edwards I’ll play a song. Jeff “Chairman” Mao A little piece of something? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. This song… Jeff “Chairman” Mao Firstly, what is this device here you have? Kutcha Edwards You ever seen one of those? [Holds up instrument] Jeff “Chairman” Mao We got a lot of technical people here, so you know… Kutcha Edwards Who has ever seen one of these? Up the back? What is it? Audience Member I don’t remember. Kutcha Edwards It’s called an Omnichord. It’s made by Suzuki, so it’s obviously from either Korea or Japan. This was bought by a friend of mine nearly six years ago. My mate and brother, very close friend of mine, Paul Hester, played for Crowded House. Last year, took his life and we don’t what for. That is up to him. I had a lot of media trying to chase me, trying to get me to say what I wanted to say about Paul, but what I had to say about Paul is between me and Paul at the time. He was a great supporter of not only me as an individual, but me as an indigenous person. He bought me this for my birthday about seven years ago. I wrote this actual song, not on this instrument, but an instrument that I borrowed off him for about six months. He said, “Come around Kutcha, it’s your birthday tomorrow. This is all in a couple of days and we’ll put on barbie for you.” So, I went around there and I said, “I wrote you this song.” I played this song. Can you hear that?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao You want to explain a little bit about that, as far as what you recently did, this little trip that you made and what the purpose of that was and what the circumstances were? Kutcha Edwards I was asked by a niece of mine – the most stupidest question is the question you don’t ask – but my niece she said, “Uncle Kutcha, can you come up to my school?” This was when the Commonwealth Games was happening here in Melbourne, or as we term them the “Stolen Wealth games.” She came and saw me at a show and she said, “Uncle Kutcha, can you come up to my school?” As soon as she said it, I said, “Yeah. You just organize it and I’ll come up.” At the start of the year, there was a freak accident, a car accident, where a car skittled close to 15 children and killed about eight of them, and the car driver drove off, but he got apprehended. A lot of the kids up there are still trying to come to terms with that. So, I went up to the senior school and the last couple of days have been writing a song, not so much to write about that situation but for them to have the impetus to start the ball rolling. I was explaining to Jeff and Wolf, I like using analogies and saying… but a marathon starts with one step. If they can learn how to express themselves in song writing, rather than going down to the park, getting somebody else to buy them a bottle of whatever and drinking themselves to oblivion. Talking to somebody and expressing it in that way is more powerful than the trip that they might have on that bottle of alcohol or that chuff. That’s, I suppose, what I do. I go to jails and sit with supposed bad people. But sometimes a pat on the back is more powerful than a six-month term in a lock-up. I’ve slept in gutters. I’ve seen the other side. I’ve been to hell and back. Close to death is fairly scary. That was eight years ago, and I haven’t touched one drop, one smoke, one snort, in eight years. As soon as I came out of that hospital, that was it for me. My son was nine when it happened and he turns 18, not this Saturday but Saturday week. I didn’t want him to go through the same thing that I had gone through with my father, so I said, “I will not only try to change my life, but anybody that has the opportunity.” That’s what life is all about. It’s about opportunity. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You mentioned with Blackfire being part of a movement as far as politics or addressing messages in your music. Did you take inspiration from protest music or activist music from countries, from here, what sort of stuff inspired you? Kutcha Edwards With Blackfire I got the opportunity to travel to China three times. I got to travel to Taiwan, Mexico, Japan. To travel the world and not have to pay a cent to do it was great. I remember going to China the very first time and going to Guangzhou and we would walk down the street and people would just stop and walk over and want to touch the skin. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Because they’d never seen …? Kutcha Edwards Never seen a person of my obvious stature but of my color as well. The opportunity I had there was amazing. Non-indigenous people in this country would say, “Kutcha, you talk a hell of a lot about politics,” but the reality is that I was put into this situation. You back a dog up into a corner with a stick and prod at him all the time, he’s bound to bite. He’s bound to get aggressive and want to attack, but I find that if I can debate the situation – we have journalists in certain papers in Melbourne here who are dead-set racists and their knowledge of Aboriginal people is they went to school with one back when they were in primary school. If you want to know about indigenous issues, come and talk to the horse. Don’t talk to the jockey. Come and sit with an Aboriginal person and you’ll get the real deal. Don’t think because you watch Rabbit-Proof Fence that you know what I’m talking about. I read it in a paper… Come and talk to the horse and you’ll understand where we’re coming from. That’s the problem. If you don’t know how to fix up the wiring in your house, go see an electrician. Jeff “Chairman” Mao How segregated do you think the society is? Kutcha Edwards Here? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Yeah. Still. There’s a history of moving Aboriginal people to settlements. Kutcha Edwards Still a long way to go. It’s a hell of a long way to go. They would rather sweep all of us under the carpet. The street gets their knowledge from what I was just talking about, gets their understanding from journalists or from the TV or from a movie. I go to a lot of schools, to a lot of businesses, to talk about cultural immersion and how to deal with indigenous issues, but they are still trying to fix the problem, rather than coming to us and saying, “How can we fix this problem?” They think they know and they don’t. Jeff “Chairman” Mao In the brief amount of research that I’ve done I’ve seen it written that part of the issue is that governments will claim that there’s no central authority, or there wasn’t at a certain point, for Aboriginal people. Is that a legitimate claim? Kutcha Edwards Well, there are over 500 nations within Australia itself before, BC, before Cook. To suggest now that there is multiculturalism in Australia is a load of bullshit. We had all different laws within each clan, each tribe, but two years ago they had a central organization called ACLEI, which was a central body, a central organization, that had representatives from each area, each state, each region within that state, that represented Aboriginal people. That form of law, that form of body, is the [west’s way] of politics, I suppose. The old way was elders would decide, sitting council, and decide what would happen. A lot of that law, that just law is being lost because elders are passing at 50-60 years old. In reality, I’m 40, so I’m getting close to that status. To call me an elder would be ridiculous, but that’s the reality now. Any questions? Jeff “Chairman” Mao I just want to pause, make sure… has anyone anything they want to ask at this point? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Can we get the mic in the audience up? Audience Member There it is. How you doing? Kutcha Edwards Good. Audience Member I just had a small question. I’ve traveled to a few Third World countries, a lot of war-torn countries, specifically the Sudan, where my family’s from. I noticed that the youth, people have been oppressed, the kids attach themselves to hip-hop. I would go through the streets there and see kids who were fighting in the civil war and they’d be listening to songs from Tupac as inspiration to them. I wanted to know, do Aboriginal youth listen to hip-hop or what kind of views do they get from it? Kutcha Edwards They’re into it too here. I have a friend who is from the States. His name is Wiley J Miller. I don’t know where he’s from, but every time... Snoop came over here just recently, and Ja Rule. I think Nelly was here. He manages, I don’t know how he does it, but he gets in there and he gets tickets. A lot of our kids have the opportunity to go and see these people. They’re dressing that way, and I don’t deny them the right, but as a singer-songwriter myself, I would prefer that they attached themselves to songwriters from here. But that’s what’s happening all around the world. If they’re getting into music because of Tupac and so forth, it’s better them do that than going around smashing heads, you know what I mean? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Blackfire was recording in what period? Kutcha Edwards ’83 to ’89. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. Kutcha Edwards ’89. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I’m curious. That’s actually very fertile time in American hip-hop as far as activism and conscious musical content. Did that have any sort of bearing on any of the stuff that you did? Kutcha Edwards No. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Or, did you see it? Did it get over here and into the communities? Kutcha Edwards No. We were more into rock. How long’s hip-hop been going for? Jeff “Chairman” Mao On record, since 1979. Kutcha Edwards Well, it didn’t get over here until probably mid or early ’90s. Jeff “Chairman” Mao On a widespread level, you mean? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. But they’re dressing ... That track suit and all. I sort of look at our kids and think, what’s his name, Ali G… You know what I mean? I don’t know. It’s a shame being an indigenous person in this country, and our people trying to mimic something from the States, do you know what I mean? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Right. Kutcha Edwards It’s hard to deal with. I’m getting to an age where ... Jeff “Chairman” Mao I mean, you took inspiration from Robert Cray. It’s probably a similar situation for them, taking inspiration from artists from the States. Kutcha Edwards We’re all influenced by the States, brother. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Anybody else have anything they want to interject at this point? It’s a fellow guitarist here. Audience Member Hello. Kutcha Edwards Hey buddy. Audience Member We’ve actually met a few times. I don’t expect that you remember me. Kutcha Edwards You’re the guy from ... Audience Member Broadmeadows. My last time I met you was quite funny. You were doing a show in Broadmeadows at [inaudible]. We also both know Wiley. Wiley’s from Utah. Kutcha Edwards Utah, that’s it. Wiley’s a funny character. Audience Member Yeah, OK. But, last time it was quite funny actually. The last time we met in Broadmeadows, you were doing a show. I walked into this massive tent, and I think you were just talking about the two major Chinese languages or something. You said, “Is there anybody in this audience who’s Chinese?” It was right about that time I’d lost my voice completely, so I wasn’t going to put my hand up. I actually shrunk into the corner because I knew people would be pointing me out. Then sure enough, the table next to me is like, “Young man. Young man.” I’m like, “Oh, no.” Then you starting saying to me. I was just like, “Can you tell him that I’ve lost my voice.” “He’s lost his voice.” It was quite funny. It was quite embarrassing. What I really wanted to ask you was, I just want to move away from the political side of it for a little while, because I’d really like to have that conversation with you at some other point. What I’d really like to ask you is, over the centuries and over the millennia, oppression has always, always caused awesome art. Not just music, but let’s say, if we go back to the ’80s, political and even musical oppression caused punk. If we move back before then, the blacks that were oppressed in America, they formed jazz and before then even blues. You know what I mean? The slaves in Brazil... Away from music now, in Brazil, you know the white masters oppressed them and they weren’t allowed to do martial arts, and so a certain form of martial arts was born, being capoeria. Where do you stand? What do you think about that? It’s quite a heavy thing to deal with, to go, “OK, there’s oppression, however, oppression generally, if we look back through history, causes awesome things to happen?” Kutcha Edwards You’ll find, and this is where it’s different for me. It’s different for me because I have been politically motivated, whereas traditional peoples, traditional Aboriginal people, because they sing in language and because they still have connection to culture as such, that their song line is sung. They are singing about country, they are singing about why the long-necked turtle does what it does. Why the snake, the [inaudible] does what it does, and how it does it. Why the rain rains at that certain time of day. Why the winds will create a storm. Their song line, their singing is not about politics. It’s about country, it’s about their connection to country, their lineage to the oldest people in the world. Their music, and I shouldn’t say “their”, because they are me too. You know what I mean? Audience Member I understand. Kutcha Edwards My form of my song line is now with a foreign instrument and with a foreign language. I am still culturally relevant and culturally correct, except I have been pushed into the corner because of politics, and this is the only form of language that I know. Audience Member There’s no doubt about that, I’m not questioning that whatsoever. What I’m saying is though, apart from song content, oppression generally, in history, outside of exclusively Australian history, but all over the world in all contexts and throughout time, we’ve been finding that music or art in whatever form generally comes from, or generally, can come from heavy oppression. Even now I think, we’ve had a lot of lecturers come in and a lot of them have been saying this is a turning point in history. It’s really either going to go one way or another, and that’s certainly true. That’s a form of oppression, like information oppression or whatever you want to call it. I just want to get an idea of how you feel about that. Kutcha Edwards What I said before is, some people create music for the wrong reason. To me, music is just not the resonance of the note of the sound. To me, it’s an expression of who I am and where I come from. I can’t explain it more than that. It’s who Kutcha Edwards is now. Music is just a small part of my existence here. Education is more ... I cop it every day, racism every day in some form. But, rather than going and punching somebody in the face, I would rather educate them. That’s what this does for me. Music can educate the uneducated, hopefully. Does that answer your question? Audience Member Thank you, sir. Yes. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Let me ask you something else. I mean, obviously, this is your life. This is what you do, what you love to do. How much apathy from a younger generation do you sense? Or, do you feel like you’re ever pressured creatively to maybe not be so pointed in some of your messages, as far as making music? Ultimately, it’s entertainment for people. Is it something that you think about in terms of, “Maybe I’m getting too heavy right now with this. Do I need to lighten the mood to do things?” Kutcha Edwards That was a period of time with Blackfire, we were getting too serious about the content, about land rights and about pollution and about all these other day-to-day problems. But, that’s why this album, this new album that I’m bringing out, is more to the lyrical content, and what I am singing about is more to do with universal love. I found that, when I was back on the turps [drinking], people don’t want to hear you. People don’t want to listen to you. He’s blabbing on because he’s pissed or stoned off his rocker, you know what I mean? People like Paul Kelly wouldn’t come within a bar of me when I was on the turps. Two years ago, three years ago, he got asked to write the official theme song for the opening of the new museum here in Melbourne. It was a $20,000 commission to write a two-minute song. He said, “OK, I’ll do it,” not knowing that he had to go film a movie in South Australia. He said, “I’m double booked, but I’ve got a guy who I think can do this.” He rang me and said, “Could you do it, Kutcha?” He wouldn’t have done that five years ago if I was back on the slops. No way. It’s about networking. I suppose I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for the assistance of great people like Paul Kelly and people who have stood up for indigenous issues as well. We have a lot of [inaudible] here who will stand up and support the trees from being logged or whatever, but they won’t stand up for certain issues. But Paul Kelly is one of them. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You want to play anything off of the CD to give us a little taste of what you’ve been up to? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. This song was written in prison with four or five nephews of mine. Ironically, time is all they have. So we wrote this song here. (music: Kutcha Edwards – “Time is All I Have” / applause) Jeff “Chairman” Mao You said that was written or recorded in ... Kutcha Edwards That was written with about eight of my nephews in one of the maximum security prisons here in Victoria. Jeff “Chairman” Mao They’re all incarcerated? Kutcha Edwards Incarcerated, yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao All eight of your nephews are incarcerated? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao For what sort of ... ? Kutcha Edwards For all sorts of, I suppose, crimes. But, I look at it in a sense where, to me, every law that is passed by this government, or governments prior to before, or after invasion, 1798, is a false law. Whose law are they breaking in reality? There are thousands, upon thousands, upon thousands of laws that are broken every day. Laws that were here in Australia prior to Captain Cook coming here. I look at it in a different light, Jeff, you know. It’s hard, it’s hard for me to go in there and see my people incarcerated for trivial little misdemeanors, you know what I mean? But that’s life. And that’s why I do it. I go in there to let them know that they are still a part of community. They have community out here in the bigger picture, you know. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Do you feel a connection to the caucasian artists from Australia? Kutcha Edwards Yeah, yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Obviously, you collaborated with Paul Kelly, he’s a dear friend of yours. You’re searching to carve your place, establish your own identity as an indigenous person, but do you feel like the musical lineage of white musicians in Australia is something that you feel, I don’t know, in any way a part of, or do you feed off of it? Kutcha Edwards The reality is here in Australia, if I was to bring out… I brought this CD out, what year was it? 2002, 2003 [holds up CD]. I went to the record store, I went to the record store in one of the major shopping centers here, and I said, “Excuse me,” and not to be egotistical, I went, I said, “Excuse me, have you got a Kutcha Edwards CD here?” And they said, “Yes, it’s in world music.” What is more Australian that an Aboriginal person singing about himself or what he has been through, or about this country. And to find my CD in “World Music” was a bit of a kick in the teeth. That’s how hypocritical the music industry is here. The everyday Australian doesn’t want to hear about the plight of the Aboriginal person. It’s hard for me as an indigenous performer to sell my wares, so to speak. Jeff “Chairman” Mao That must be a concern. You’re going to require the support of a white record-buying audience in order to survive. Kutcha Edwards Yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Correct? Kutcha Edwards But making money doesn’t motivate me. Telling the truth does. And that’s why I do what I do. That’s why I write about everyday issues. I don’t write about things that don’t affect me, or haven’t affected me. To me, the song that you just heard, “Time is All I Have,” is going on an album that will go to manufacturing, probably the end of next week. I’ve got to mix down one more song, master that song, master the whole CD and it will go to manufacturing. It will cost me about $700-$800 to go to manufacturing. I’ll probably get a thousand CDs made, but I won’t go to a record label. I’ll just sell them myself and distribute them at gigs. I don’t want to be hell bent on trying to get them distributed to Darwin and all around the world. If that happens, that happens. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What has your experience been with record labels? Kutcha Edwards This album here actually was signed by Shock Records. A lot of lip service. A lot of lip service is given with the industry here you know. I’m not in it to make, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars, I just want to get my music to wherever it can go. Wherever. And if every student here gives me their address and 20 bucks, I’ll send it to you. Yeah, yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You’re constantly performing. Kutcha Edwards I’m constantly performing. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I would think that if that’s how you’re primarily – you’re reliant on to distribute your self-pressed, self-produced copies, I would think that would be… Kutcha Edwards Well that’s what I do. In any form. I don’t know, to sell a thousand CDs in a year, that would be fine. All I want to really do is sing about who and what I am, and where I have come from. If I get the opportunity to go overseas again, and get offered to come to the school in Florida next year, I’m only joking, yeah. I’m asking you to take me to the school. Wherever. I just want to keep on doing what I’m doing. It doesn’t faze me if nobody buys a CD. The work that I do is more important. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Does anybody else have anything they want to ask or interject. Kutcha Edwards Yeah, buddy. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Just going to wait for the microphone. Audience Member I just wondered what the state of indigenous media is here in Melbourne. I live in Sydney, we’ve got [inaudible] up there. It’s wicked. I just wonder if there’s anything similar. Kutcha Edwards [Inaudible] Audience Member Yeah, yeah. I just wonder if there’s anything like that down here. Kutcha Edwards Pardon? Audience Member I wondered if there was anything like that down here. Kutcha Edwards There’s an indigenous radio station called 3 Kool n Deadly. Cullin being the nation of Aboriginal people here. C-U-L-L-I-N. But we spell 3 Kool and Deadly, 3-K-O-O-L-N-Deadly. But that’s an indigenous radio station in Preston. But I do radio, I actually came straight from radio to here. I do radio for 3CR, 3CR, which is not indigenous radio station, but has had indigenous programs for the last 27 years. So, that’s who I broadcast for. The last four years, I’ve produced shows live from four prisons in Victoria live to air. That had never been done before in Australia. Received a human rights award for such programs, and it was never done before, but… Jeff “Chairman” Mao You received an award in 2001? Is it correct? What was that? How did it make you feel? Kutcha Edwards I don’t talk about it because I want people to see who I am and what I am rather than to see what I have done. But I was awarded Indigenous Australian of the Year 2001, for my work that I do, not only here in Victoria, in Melbourne, but around Australia. I was also in that same year awarded Male Artist of the Year – funnily enough in the Australian Music Awards, the ARIAs, there is no indigenous component in the awards, so Aboriginal people started their own awards and I was awarded Male Indigenous Artist of the Year. Jeff “Chairman” Mao I was curious to know if that was a category that had existed from… Kutcha Edwards Jeff “Chairman” Mao Yeah. Kutcha Edwards The Deadlies are created by indigenous people. In the Grammys in America they have soul, they have indigenous, you know, Native American sections, they have all these genres. But in Australia, there is no indigenous component in the Australian music awards, and we thought that was a slap in the face, so we created our own. Audience Member I don’t understand the word indigenous. Kutcha Edwards Indigenous is Aboriginal. The white fellows’ word for Aboriginal people. Audience Member But it means something? Indigenous? Kutcha Edwards Indigenous means the traditional people of this country. Audience Member Oh. I didn’t hear indigenous music until now in Australia. Kutcha Edwards Have you ever heard of a band called Yothu Yindi? Audience Member No, they never play on radio, or we had not any guest playing local music. Kutcha Edwards OK. Audience Member I heard country music, but I didn’t feel it is really from Australia. Kutcha Edwards Where are you going tomorrow? Do you know where you are going tomorrow? Audience Member No. Kutcha Edwards You don’t know? Jeff “Chairman” Mao We don’t tell them anything. Kutcha Edwards I could take you to the Melbourne Museum, or to the Aboriginal radio station. Audience Member Yeah, I would really like to see the music that is made originally from Australia. Kutcha Edwards See, there is traditional, which is with yidaki, with didgeridoo. And then language, and then there is contemporary indigenous music. Audience Member It is only in museum, like it has passed, or there is something evolving and continuing over… Kutcha Edwards Over here? Audience Member Like the Aboriginals. They have perpetuated their culture, or it is something from the past that you see in museums? Like the pyramids in Egypt and the old ancient Egyptian civilization? It doesn’t resemble at all Egypt today. Kutcha Edwards To me, in answering this question, what I am singing in English, whatever I create, whatever I create as an Aboriginal person… Audience Member It is new? Kutcha Edwards Is indigenous music to me. It is Aboriginal music. It’s being created by an Aboriginal person. It might be in English, it might be with this weird instrument, but to me what I create, to me is Aboriginal music. Do you know what I’m trying to say? Audience Member OK. Are all the most the contemporary Aboriginal people, they express in your type of music, which I think is like folk music? Kutcha Edwards Folk. Audience Member Yeah? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. Audience Member You don’t have Aboriginal who express in… Kutcha Edwards Language. Audience Member Who mix ancient sound with the English, which is the… Kutcha Edwards There’s a band called Yothu Yindi. They were from far north, the Northern Territory. The top end of Australia. The simple fact that I sort of explained that invasion to this country Australia, the southern states were hit more prominently than the top end of Australia. They still speak language in their native tongue, and sing in native tongue, and play with the old instruments that they’ve been playing for thousands of years. Down here, because of invasion, colonization, that we, like I said, we were forced not to speak language. Audience Member You cannot learn at school? Kutcha Edwards No, it’s all lost. It’s … Audience Member It’s a [deliberate decision to make you] lose the language? Kutcha Edwards Yes. Probably if we were to go to archives in Canberra and to study language at University in Canberra where all the archives and all… for some unknown reason, all our artifacts, some of our skeletons, some of our people, are still in cabinets in museums around the world. Any other people around the world, they would get buried in a dignified way. Our people are still in cabinets in England. You know what I mean? So, it’s about acknowledging that culture to us is more than just an artifact, it’s our knowledge to country, it’s our spirituality. To me, because I don’t speak lingo, doesn’t mean to say that I am not a culturally alright Aboriginal person to talk to. Audience Member It’s not a dying culture. It’s still alive and it can... Kutcha Edwards In all different forms. Where are you from brother? Audience Member I am Lebanese. Kutcha Edwards Lebanese. Audience Member Lebanese, but we have the same type of occupation in the region. They try to crush the culture, like they don’t let people speak or you cannot learn. I thought maybe it’s like sort of apartheid. Kutcha Edwards Like in America, you have Arapaho, you have Sioux, you have all the different clans of Indians and they all speak different tongue. But here in Australia, the same thing. All speak different lingo. We’re not all the one person. Governments talk to us as if we are the one person. You know what I mean? We are all different nations. Audience Member You have schools. You have Aboriginal schools? Kutcha Edwards Not as such, no. We are forced to assimilate. Audience Member You are forced to assimilate? Kutcha Edwards Yes. Audience Member OK, it’s crazy. Kutcha Edwards It is, I know. JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO Got some more questions. Kutcha Edwards Good question. Thank you brother. Audience Member Hello, my name is Anna. Kutcha Edwards Hello. Audience Member Would you like to play us some traditional music? Would you like to play us some traditional Aboriginal music? Kutcha Edwards I would love to sing lingo, but I can’t. Here, I can sing you a song. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Are you asking if he has any CD? Audience Member For traditional language? Kutcha Edwards No. I am what is called an urbanized Aboriginal. Brother in the back there. That’s what I mean, Anna, is to me what I am creating today, what I have been creating, is all Aboriginal music to me because it comes from this Aboriginal person right here. Because I don’t speak lingo, or I don’t play yidaki, doesn’t mean that it’s not indigenous. Ten Canoes, to be honest, I haven’t seen it. Audience Member I would like to know, is there a place here in Australia where the Aboriginal people are more concentrated, like lots of them? Kutcha Edwards Central dessert. Alice Springs, a town called Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, where all the clan groups, all the dessert people come in from the dessert and congregate in this place called Alice Springs. People would say, “Look at this one lot of people.” They’re all different nations of Aboriginal people. You’ll find that you go around to all the states, all the main cities, you’ll have urban Aboriginal people living in these... You know you go to Sydney and they’re in Redfern, you go to Adelaide and they’re probably in Port Adelaide. You go to Perth and they’re in Fremantle. We are a dispersed people, you know. You walk up the street here in Richmond, you’re flat out trying to find an Aboriginal person. You know what I mean? Audience Member I’ve just saw one girl in the club since I’ve got here. Kutcha Edwards Pardon. Audience Member I said since I’ve got here I just saw one Aboriginal girl in the club. Kutcha Edwards There you go. Audience Member I also want to know is there a place where the Aboriginal language is being taught, maybe to kids? Kutcha Edwards Language for the southern states, and Melbourne being a southern state, and I suppose Adelaide and Sydney, like I said before, a lot of our language has – well it’s in hibernation, if you can say that. It’s not lost, but it needs to be reclaimed and got out of textbooks in museums and all our possum-skin cloaks, and all our boomerangs, and all our spears, and all our bones that are in filing cabinets, in white-fellow buildings around the world. I would love to know my own lingo… Audience Member [inaudible] Kutcha Edwards I suppose it would. My brother has studied genealogy and Canberra. I would love to speak in my language. I would love to sit here and sing every lyric in my native tongue, but... pardon? Well, come back in five years. Is that when they’re coming back? Come back in five years and I will have all my lyrics hopefully interpreted. You know, I could get it interpreted into my tongue, but it wouldn’t be mine? Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. I could probably... like the young fella who was sitting here before. I can sing a song in Chinese, I have learned to sing a certain song in Chinese, and it is a shame for me to say that I can sing in Chinese and not my own lingo. I was forced to speak this tongue here, and it was all I was taught as a child. Audience Member Are there any like Aboriginal people like in politics? Are you represented in the government? Kutcha Edwards In the Australian political scene, there have only been two indigenous politicians. One being Senator Neville Bonner. He was back in the late ’70s, he is now passed, and there was a guy just recently, Aden Ridgeway. He was in the Democrats I think. They are the only two politicians in the history of politics here in Australia. Now, the reality of that is that would the wider Australian community ever sit and let a black man represent them at the round table? I don’t think so. Audience Member Are you still denied of maybe some rights, certain rights, I mean today? Kutcha Edwards I would say yes. We are denied land rights. Why do we have to prove to the visitor of this country that it is ours? You know what I mean? Why do we have to go to the High Court of Australia to get a piece of paper to say that this is our country, and always was, and always will be? It seems hypocritical to me to do so. At least in South Africa, the majority of people with this color, to turn the tables… sweet brother, sweet. I suppose, I am going to be involved in a concert on the 27th and 28th of October at the Melbourne Concert Hall, where I think it’s about 25 songwriters, indigenous, Aboriginal songwriters are coming together, not to collaborate, but to perform pieces that have been performed as struggle, as freedom songs here in Australia in a concert called Black Arm Band, and to give a different, I suppose, genre to the music that we are used to hearing. I have written a piece specifically for this concert. A song called “Is This What We Deserve.” A song that explains why do we deserve the deal that we’ve been dealt. In answering that question, it would be great if we could get ... But I think Hugh Masekela is actually coming over for this concert, to perform “Free Nelson Mandela,” that song, at this concert. We would love to sit with people like Snoop and musicians of that caliber, who are well-known right around the country, around the world, the globe, to sit and maybe collaborate and maybe do stuff like that. The opportunity is not there. They fly in, do their shows, fly out. We would love for people to understand the plight when they come to Australia and sit with us, but they sit with the promoters and whoever, and it’s hard. It’s hard to even get your foot in the door. I would love to, brother. I would to do it. I would love to see that happen, but you know ... Jeff “Chairman” Mao I mean, obviously there’s no simple answer for this, but what, in your estimation, would it require for Aboriginal people to reach the equality that is desired? Kutcha Edwards All it needs is opportunity, really. It comes back to that. If Paul didn’t come here two weeks ago, Paul Kelly I’m talking about. If Paul Kelly didn’t come here two weeks ago to put the thought in the mind to talk to Wolf, to get to talk to me. It’s about opportunity. It’s about me, when I get here, and when I have got here, to hopefully plant the seed, drop a stone in the middle of the pond. The effects will be felt. What is that saying? The butterfly effect. Jeff “Chairman” Mao The ripple effect? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Is there anything you want to say, I guess towards conclusion here, about everybody’s opportunity here, as far as what they’re expressing. I mean, everybody’s doing their own thing. They’re expressing themselves in whatever ways that fits them, but it may not be a political voice. You talk about opportunity. You want to address that at all, as far as opportunity to be heard by other people? Kutcha Edwards Yeah. Can I sing a song? Jeff “Chairman” Mao Of course. Kutcha Edwards It’ll explain. Like I said, I lost my brother last September. September 9th. I went back to my traditional lands, back up in New South Wales. We believe that, when somebody passes, whether they’re two days old or 90 years old, that they become ancestors. They become our spiritual guidance, our ancestors. I went back to country. I went back to country to mourn properly. To let my brother… I suppose, feel him properly. On traditional country, spiritual country. My mother, my mother in passing in June, she had fought the fight to the very end, and passed away. I got a phone call. She passed away on the June 5th. I got a phone call at about 8 AM that morning, and they said I had to travel nearly two-and-a-half, three hours to Gippsland, to the hospital. She passed away at ten o’clock that night, but we waited and waited and waited for the oldest brother to turn off the machine. I wrote this song that I’m going to sing two days after she passed, and I sung it at her funeral. This is what, I suppose, songwriting is, for me. Songwriting for me is more than just words slapped on a bit of paper. It’s a tribute to my mother for being… If it wasn’t for her, if it wasn’t for her fight against something she believed was wrong, I would have been lost to that assimilation policy, which put me in the homes to take me away from her and my father in the first place. I wouldn’t be sitting here expressing my knowledge or my belief in knowledge of who and what I am. I would have been lost to the assimilation policy. I sing this song in tribute to my mother and any other mother who has had to deal with what she had to deal with. I thank you for the opportunity guys, but I’ll sing this. I’ve got a gig to go to tonight anyway. Yeah. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What is the title of this song? Kutcha Edwards This song is called ... My nephew, my nephew Shannon. Like I said before, I’m one of 12 kids – 12 children, and I’m ninth youngest. My nephew Shannon, he is my second eldest sister’s first son. My mother, his grandmother, reared him up since he was a little tiny kid. My sister, because of, I suppose, having to deal with what we had to deal with, couldn’t ... When you’re not taught how to love, or if you haven’t been loved, you find it hard to give love. My sister is one of those people who, rather than… Yeah, she gave her son to my grandmother to look after. Her son to his grandmother, my mother. My nephew lent over my mother, so he is practically the 13th child. He lent over his nan when all the machines were turned off, and he saw that she was struggling to breathe, and he looked at her and he said, “Nan, just go to sleep. We know you’re tired, just go to sleep.” That resonated. I remembered that. The song’s called “Tired Eyes.”
Jeff “Chairman” Mao I’ll say thanks to Mr Kutcha Edwards. Kutcha Edwards Thank you. Thank you. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Appreciate it. Unless anybody has any more questions they want to ask him? Kutcha Edwards If that gives you a bit of an idea of who I am and where I come from, I thank you guys. Thank you. Audience Member Thank you for that beautiful song. When Paul Kelly was here, you mentioned the Dreamtime, and I don’t believe I know anything about them. Could you explain? Kutcha Edwards The Dreamtime? Audience Member Is it time? Kutcha Edwards Dreamtime. It’s like, to try and explain it is, have you ever seen that movie? I think Val Kilmer’s in it. It’s a movie, but I’m trying to associate how to explain it. He is a Native American, and he’s working for the FBI. He has to go back and try and work out how these murders occurred in this Indian community. In going back to this indigenous Indian community, he sits and talks with this old uncle, old fella, old Native American fella. He also talked about shapeshifting, how the indigenous American Native people shapeshift. They can become the wolf or the eagle or the crow, and they can shapeshift into this animal. To us, to explain it in, when we pass, when we go to what you call heaven. You might call it heaven or wherever it is, we go to the Dreamtime, and we become the totem that we are given, as Aboriginal people. That is, to try and explain it, that is our belief as traditional peoples of this country. We go to the Dreamtime. Trying to say we go to heaven or hell, but as indigenous people we go to the Dreamtime. We have messages from the other side every day of our lives. It’s how we interpret their messages as to how we can deal with… I don’t want to sound coy or try and sound as if I am bullshitting, talking crap, but there are messages every day in certain things that the environment does. One of them is that, when a willy wagtail flashes in front of your face or annoys you to the point where you’ve got to shoo it away, that willy wagtail is sending you a message that somebody very close to you has passed. That has occurred to me a lot lately. If that can explain that question, I hope it has. Audience Member [Can you explain] song lines? Kutcha Edwards The song line. Audience Member Yes. Kutcha Edwards Yeah, what I am doing here today is my song line, my destiny. Somebody’s song line is practically their destiny. There is a reason and a purpose for everything that we do. Singing about why the weather is the way that it is or why that tree sits where it sits or why the rocks are formed in that way is… Traditional people will sing about that, and that is their song line, because they are singing of their country, of their way of life. Does that explain that? Yeah, cool. Well anyway guys, thanks for the opportunity. [Applause] Jeff “Chairman” Mao Give it up one more time for Kutcha Edwards please. Thank you. Kutcha Edwards Thank you.

In talking about people who’ve passed, they’re always with us and I conversate as if he was sitting right here and he is, poking me in the ribs as we speak. My brother who passed last September and my mother. I lost my mother in June this year, who is finally at peace. She doesn’t have to argue with bureaucrats or people who don’t understand any more. I just flew back yesterday. I was up in the north of the state, talking and writing songs with students who were going through their own problems at the moment with people who’ve passed in their school.
(music: Kutcha Edwards – “Tired Eyes” / applause)
Her name was Mary Lou. Mary Edwards.

Leon Ware
Leon Ware was a critically acclaimed Motown songwriter and arranger who recorded some of the greatest albums ever made. Born in Detroit in 1940 as the seventh son of a Ford worker and a beautician, Leon Ware’s first song came together at age nine. When the ’60s began he joined the producer staff of Motown where he worked with The Isley Brothers, Ike And Tina Turner, Diana Ross, Donnie Hathaway, Quincy Jones, Minnie Riperton — you name it. Marvin Gaye’s classic “I Want You” was supposed to be for Ware’s solo album but Berry Gordy convinced him to collaborate with Gaye instead. Following that, he went on to write the first number one hit for Michael Jackson as a soul artist. In this talk at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, the late legend waxes nostalgic about his extensive musical career and songwriting for Motown Records.
Hosted by Leon Ware I’m clapping for you all because being here is a step in the right direction, I truly believe. I’m actually very pleased to be here because the meaning of being here is touching as you all came here for the same reason: To touch each other in a way that you can’t, I would say, normally. It’s either email or some type of mail that we have these days, which is not a bad thing, but at least in this form you get a chance to get into each other one-on-one and share some ideas. I actually have a couple of songs that I have written for the moment. I won’t get into it right now, but let’s say that [they] kind of exemplify the moment in itself. And me being religiously nasty you can expect it to be something that you will smile about, I’m sure. Torsten Schmidt Well, those words came from a man who doesn’t need all too much introduction. He has been behind a couple... I think it’s fair to say that and a good reason to take off the hat as well. [takes off the hat] One of the best albums — albums are those long records that you can listen to for a long time and not just a three-minute hit — that ever have been recorded, I guess. And yeah, I think it’s a very good thing to give him an official welcome, Mr. Leon Ware. [applause] Leon Ware Thank you very much. You could add to that by saying it’s one of the most prolific albums as far as babies are concerned. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt As we discussed yesterday in the radio, it must feel kind of weird that wherever you go you meet people that had you in their bedroom already. Leon Ware Oh, that’s weird. Listen: It is a total pleasure, I’m an extremely freaky individual. Think of it like this, I look at the world as my lover, and we have been making love for a looong time and we still find new and interesting ways to do the same thing. Ha, ha. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt Well, on that note, probably we start off with the easier topics. What actually is this thing, love? Leon Ware Love, without a question, is what we all have instinctively, but unfortunately it gets drastically fucked up when we get just — excuse me, I didn’t use the right word, did I? But it does get a little bit disturbed when you get past, say, three years old. Unfortunately, because you learn some senses that divert you from really understanding who you are, what your purpose is here. I think what we all share, 100 percent, is the same reason why I consider myself a sensual minister. Not to be funny. But to remind everyone that I come in contact to cherish where we come from. I have fun with it because the moment I say I am a sensual minister, I get this chuckle. However, I’m addressing simply where we come from. I’m very proud to be one of the voices that... I’m coming up with some innuendo that I haven’t even used yet. So that if this, in my time, will allure, excite, invite anyone and everyone that listens to it to a place where they make love, I’m an excessively happy man. Torsten Schmidt But isn’t there a little bit more to love than just making love? Leon Ware Love is making love and being in love. That’s the two combinations. Torsten Schmidt How do you know when you are in love? Leon Ware Well, you shouldn’t have to ask. You shouldn’t have to ask. This is spirit. The most honest thing about where I’m at in my pursuit, I have not made decisions that were business decisions ever. I have always been very idealistic. And in fact, really cruelly opposed by different friends and family about some of the decisions I have made. At 65, going on 66 — and I had my first hit 1964 before a lot of you were alive — every one of my moods, everything I have ever done has been from here. [points at his heart] So I don’t even question about — maybe I’m questioned — but I don’t question my premise because it’s very simple as I say. When I started, I recorded my first record 1955, I made my first professional record in 1960 and it hasn’t stopped. I feel like what I look at now is the group of people or this mind-set that you are in — young people, you have such a wonderful time in front of you because not only with the facilities that we have whereas from Pro Tools to the different sequencers and stuff you have that to work with, you get the internet — there is a lot of things that are plus. The only thing that’s different might be a deficit is that in my time there was a lot of camaraderie, which is what I’m hoping will happen here with all of you. At the best when you will leave here, you will feel a seed. As I saw Torsten when I came in, I got a couple of ideas that, as I say, simplifies some of the meaning here. And it is, as I say, me sensually being nasty and religiously nasty, one of the titles is “I Wanna Grow a Seed In You.” And I can see it put on a T-shirt and the smiles that you will get as you pass someone. However, it’s the same meaning as, interestingly enough, when I wrote this song, “Inside My Love” for Minnie Riperton she asked me, “Do you have anything that we could say that kind of straddels the fence?” I said, “Go no further, I’ve got an idea.” Interestingly enough, when the song was released and headed up the charts, I heard a DJ’s description of the song and I stopped the car, pulled it aside and I actually called him something that I won’t use in this room. But it was really disappointing, but actually after I cursed him, then I smiled because it was a 100 percent feeling that, when we finished the song, the sentiment of the song is, “Won’t you come inside me, will you come inside me, will you take a ride inside my love?” However, listening to it, most people took it as what it was, “Won’t you come inside me,” meaning the ejaculation or the orgasm that we do when we get to have that moment. However what I meant, it came from me being a little boy in church hearing the preacher say, “Won’t you come, won’t you come inside the lord?” [whispers] And I took that with me all my life and, in fact, that particular phrase I say to people was so compelling that when I thought that it was coming up at the end of the sermon, I left the room. I didn’t want to hear it because it made you want to come. However, the meaning being an entendre, which I do constantly, I love that, having two meanings on one or several meanings and letting the individual listening adapt to that meaning that means something to them. I think it’s one of the strongest things you can do as a writer is to give your listener, or the people that are working with you, the option to take their particular view of what you are saying in your message. Torsten Schmidt Were you ever afraid of saying something? Leon Ware I’m instinctively an instigator. In fact, I’ll give you a scenario: I was walking behind my sister and about three of her friends at seven years old. My sister turned around and noticed that every time they were bending over I was taking an extra look. She said, “You are a nasty little boy!” And I said to myself, “Is that what I am? I think I like that!” [chuckles] So I have been nasty ever since. Religiously. And I’m really glad that I came to a point a couple of years ago that validated my nastiness. [laughs] Believe it or not, as I say it to you, I realized that the ennuendos of Marvin, me, Berry [Gordy], all the singers that you have heard in your lifetime alluded to the bedroom. It alluded to an orgasm. It alluded to anything sensual. We are only addressing where we come from. This is a beautiful place, it’s something that unfortunately in our time being here we have learned some unfortunate habits for us. What we are, how to treat things, how we look at things, you know, feeling uncomfortable about something that is as natural as you take the next breath. Some of us, like myself, are rebels. I refuse to feel bad about something that I feel good about. Something that I don’t have to work at, something that I wake up in the morning and it’s like a good sip of coffee, or a good breath of air, or something that you know you don’t want, but you need. It’s a part of you. And I would say, for sure, I look forward to every next breath I have because each day I realize that I haven’t said enough, I have not said everything. It’s like I said earlier. It’s like making love, knowing that there are so many possibilities. Torsten Schmidt But does it ever get hard to gyrate always around nastiness? Leon Ware Well, when you say, “Does it ever get hard?” I can stop right there. [laughs] However, the sincere truth is, is that I’m blessed with a natural sense... I’m a romanticist. Listen to my music. I mean, me and Marvin [Gaye], when we were doing the I Want You album, we laughed a lot. In fact, when he did this song [sings a line of “Soon I’ll Be Loving You Again”], “I want give you some head, baby.” Lots of people in here who have listened to that record haven’t even realized what was being said, but if you listen to it closely, the whole chorus is [sings], “I want give you some head, baby, that’s what I do ‘cause I’m...” Me and the engineer were standing in the studio when he did it. Of course, there was a sign on the studio board, when you came in, the first thing you were seeing was “head.” Not that we were alluding to anything [laughs], but it was like very free, we didn’t think twice about it. And I can say to all of you, out of all the times in my life, and even Marvin’s, when we went to this Motown... I will come back to that when you ask me some questions about writing and my career. One of the things that made Motown as successful as it is and was, is that they had a quality control meeting every Friday. Quality control meant that, as a writer at Motown, you wrote a song everyday, completed. Torsten Schmidt What does that look like? I mean, is it like in the ’20s in a Hollywood studio and the studio boss would walk around the premises? Leon Ware No, you did that at home. You did it at home and then they had what they call the workroom. The workroom was like six different rooms that had paper-thin walls. You heard Holland-Dozier-Holland, Stevie [Wonder], Norman Whitfield, Ivy Jo Hunter, everybody was at their axe. As I say, the wonderful thing about it was you learned how to concentrate on what you were doing. Torsten Schmidt Is that the original building opposite of the hospital? Leon Ware Yes, right next to the mortuary. We used to make jokes about it as well. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt Which jokes? What’s the the classic Motown mortuary joke? Leon Ware “We send the stiffs over there.” [laughs] Meaning the songs, you know? The songs that didn’t really make it, you know, we had a place for it, give it a headstone right away, quick. However, the quality control meant you came in with your finished songs and you had a team of people that... Torsten Schmidt [slips off his jacket] See, I’m getting comfy. Leon Ware I should as well. [slips off his jacket] They screened your songs and they told you whether your song was one that lived or was one that was ready for next door. And it was vicious because you were pitted against… Which was Motown’s, I think, its strength was that they pitted everybody that was there against each other. So at the end of the week you had 10 to 15 writers that were excessively talented coming up with their best work. And as I said to people, you didn’t think twice about that meeting, you either came in ready or you didn’t come in at all. It’s similar to when I was a young man, as a singer, coming up in Detroit, I also was blessed with a really good voice, and others knew it before I even knew it before I knew it. And in that process of doing talent shows throughout Detroit... Detroit was very big with two things, crime and music. Fortunately, I had left the crime alone in time to not really suffer, but that was a part of my life as well, unfortunately. Being a young kid in Detroit, you didn’t have any options. However, the strength of the talent in Detroit at the time and the concentration of just music itself was so rich. You had Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, Holland-Dozier-Holland. I mean, all those people all they were doing day and night was music. And again, the premise wasn’t about being stars. We all just basically loved what we were doing. As a kid I went to church every day until I was 12 years old because my mother was a bit of a minister herself, not Jehovah Witness but a Baptist, and I sung in the choir and I was a church kid, so to speak. But the interesting thing is that Detroit bursts some hall of famers, you know? People that you listen to and that will be remembered for as long as music is music. I love what I’m doing more than anything else in the world. And it’s something I have paid my dues. I mean, literally paid my dues. And the times that I have turned down opportunities that could have made me an excessively wealthy man, financially wealthy, wealthier than I may have been — some people could debate that — but my wealth isn’t about mankind wealth, it’s spiritual. Again, like Marvin, like myself – very idealistic. Marvin was really rich and he had a talent for telling you his life in a record, you know? I’m not that exposé myself, I kind of like playing with emotions. And if not playing with them, exciting them. As a kid I liked to say things that would people say, “Ahh! You didn’t say that!” That was always making me feel so good... [smirks] This bad little boy! But again, I’m happy to have arrived to see that all this time I spent from — I had my first gold record for the Isley Brothers in 1964 — and from then to now has been a wonderful journey. I look forward to saying anything that, hopefully, something that you can use, hopefully that you can take home with you and grow on. I don’t definitely want to waste your time. My son, if he was here, he would leave the room. He does not really like to hear me talk because I have a lot to say. I don’t really talk a lot normally, but this is a very rare moment for me because I get a chance to say what I feel, as opposed to sing it. Every other song I get a chance to give an idea of who I am. But for the most part I’m satisfied with these performances because with each song, every song is accountable to who I am. I think in that terms, as I said to a young man who is a rapper. Rap in itself is something that I really, really respect a whole lot. Because of the fact that, when you stop and think of what these guys say in the course of one minute, and you have to remember that... I’m a singer of songs. Songs, next to rapping, are like a walk in the park. Torsten Schmidt It’s a different discipline. I mean, they are putting out a lot of words but the question is: What are they really saying in that time? Leon Ware Well, that’s the interesting thing, some of them are really saying something. Torsten Schmidt I’m not knocking that but... Leon Ware I don’t want to play out the artistic excellence of anybody. Before I really assessed it... I guess a lot of people who hear rap hear the roughness and the animal thing, and to me at first it was so demeaning first to the ladies. Second, to just your intellect. Third it was not happy music, to me, or happy art. However, over the years they have adapted and you got some people like Common and different people that have some views, stressing some ideas and I think that’s going to be the development of that art. In every art you will have, I call them your hackers, people that write you ten songs a day, you know, but none of them are really [good]. But some of these hackers... This is the interesting thing about what we do. Make a point about your charts. Any chart you read do not put any emphasis on it because it is only a reflection of the modeled money of the people that put your record out and were able to put into that record to see itself. Unfortunately, I’m speaking of now, I’m not speaking of the time when I came into the business. Fortunately, there is a parameter there that does work, but for the most part, this time, set deals with not so much your excellence, but how excellent your connects are and how good you are as a business person. Torsten Schmidt Then again, Motown was not only about great talent but also about fabricating products as well, great products, great quality products but nevertheless... Leon Ware Yes. Motown itself, as they say, it was like a factory. You had Berry Gordy was a genius. He is a person that had an innate eye for a talent and he also knew that the smartest thing you can know about any talented person: Leave him alone. Leave him alone. But see, he had his way of guiding you. His way of guiding was putting someone next to you who maybe was just as bad as you are. [laughs] Good guidance, right? Torsten Schmidt But probably to talk about the actually working process, the scenario that you pictured there, it almost sounds like battle rap. It’s a battle rap scenario, which is all about being master seductresses. And when you got the scenario with the five rooms and you got Stevie writing next to each other and come up in this highly competitive atmosphere with the most highly seducing kind of things. What does a day feel like? What does everyone have for breakfast and...? Leon Ware There is so much energy there, and there’s so much you can come away with. But for the most part, this sensuality factor was more religious than sensual then. As I say, because I didn’t really realize how much of a freak I was until I was in my early 30s, you know? Unfortunately, or I have to say fortunately, I understand now clearly what “freak” means. It’s “free” with a “k” on it. [laughter] So in that light, I hope that everybody in here is proud to be as freaky as anybody would say that you are. We have some different views about that. Interestingly enough, I have listened to different records, I have even been questioned as to whether I was the guy that did “I Want to Do Something Freaky to You.” A different thing is what does the word “freaky” suggest in another setting? Actually, if you look at the dictionary, the word freak means somebody that’s impaired, you know, like the Elephant Man or something like that. It doesn’t mean what we have made freak out of. Which is a great word, because this isn’t a connection to sex but some people would think it’s a little bad, like they think sex is bad. But it’s not. Torsten Schmidt Really? Leon Ware Believe me. It’s religious. Torsten Schmidt OK. Leon Ware It’s like the line which said, this song that me and Marvin would call “Come Live With Me Angel,” “A good experienced freak is what you need.” Torsten Schmidt Yeah, and speaking of which because maybe that’s a good thing before we go into this whole thing of like I mean obviously, being gifted with a talent is one thing, but then realizing that someone else can probably do something out of something that you created and probably even take it to a whole different level. How do you cope with that ego-wise? Leon Ware Ego-wise for me is, I said this once before. I don’t remember ever really being intimidated. I started at three and a half years old, I won a contest playing [sings melody to Louis Jordan song “Caldonia”], “Caldonia, Caldonia, what makes your big head so hard? Boom budum budum budum budum.” Three and a half years old. I won a contest, and I’ve been patted on the head and been complimented since then. Every time I’ve ever been in crowds. In fact, from 12 to 16 I kind of avoided because it was to a point where I was not really comfortable with the attention, so to speak. Because I’m actually very shy. You wouldn’t think it, but I used to be. My thirties changed me. Torsten Schmidt What was the thing in your thirties that changed you? Leon Ware I can say to you easily it was drugs. But I became vocal, because up until my thirties I was always asked, “Was I OK?” Because I didn’t speak a lot. I was always very, very, very... You could find me very religiously in front of a piano. But if you wanted to ask me something… Torsten Schmidt The initial point was that, let’s say you wrote a song, like the one that came after the dance, and you see that you can sing yourself, and then that other boy who might be able to sing and hold a tune or two, like this Marvin guy. Leon Ware I looked at Marvin as he had the voice I wanted. He had the voice I wanted. What was really – again the words could be, where, I would say very unusual, you could say freaky, was two years before I met Marvin different friends of mine and different friends of his, on each side, were saying “You’ve got to meet Leon,” or “You’ve got to meet Marvin, you guys sound so much alike.” Marvin was already Marvin Gaye with several hits, and I was Leon with a few hits. When we met the first thing he said, I looked up, the sound of his voice was so much like mine. And then when I opened up my lungs, and, I won’t say what we were doing, but anyways, he said to me, “look,” and we both laughed for a good five minutes, because everything we said, we’d say, “I know see what they were saying,” because we had very similar vocal sounds in our voice, and interesting enough as we worked together, I say to you very clearly, there will be a time where you’ll work with somebody that you will not have to ask anything. It’s like telepathy. I’ve only had that one time happen in my life, with one individual where we knew what each other were thinking. In fact the story goes about the I Want You album was the album was actually mine, that I started out doing a demo session on T-Boy Ross who was Diana Ross’s brother who co-wrote “I Wanna Be Where You Are” and we were doing a demo session, and I had a song called “I Want You” that was the filler of the demo session, because we had three other songs and we needed one extra song and I put the song in as just another song. And Berry Gordy came in the studio, I guess the second or third day we were working on the demo session, and he said, “I like this song.” At this particular time Marvin had sworn off doing anything secular, commercial. He was actually very close to being, well, the record “Sexual Healing” was where Marvin had stopped that. Because he definitely, like myself, was brought up in the church. When I say things as I say, all my life because of learning that, you can say one thing and it can mean two things or three things. I’ve always found the way to say something nasty that could be, you could say the same thing and it would be religious. You know, in the same phrase. Torsten Schmidt Which goes back to the whole transcending thing and... Leon Ware You was saying about ego. My feeling is, is my ego is in my work. I don’t want anybody to kiss my ass, you know as normal as you... everybody, anybody that knows me always, in fact I’ve been said by several people, “You should act a different way,” but I always say to people, “I didn’t do this for that.” I did this because I love it, and like a three year old leaving the stage for the first time in my life, I turned to my mom and I said, “You mean they really like this?” And since then it’s been like that’s what carries me. I don’t really, when I see people that are successful, and I do know people that have their ass on their shoulders. Unfortunately, you know. But it’s kind of like you, when you come from where I come from – and I’ve been a blessed individual. I’ve never had to look for sanctioning or support, especially as far as my time is concerned, because my time is kind of what got me my first piece, kind of. It’s like, I can praise it. It’s a gift. I said freely, it’s a gift, it’s not mine. I do it too easily. I can write you three songs in a day, and it will all be good songs. I don’t do that now, I used to. And as I say, it comes from the Motown training that you wrote a song a day. If you are a really, really competent, talented writer, you wrote a complete song a day. And it wasn’t a hack song. It was a song that you could use. However, it’s like for me, I think it’s the pride that I have in the work that I do that I consider my ego, because as far as me being intimidated, I think the people that inspired me, Burt Bacharach, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, you know these are the guys that are gifted people. You can tell gifted people. They don’t just do it once. They do it a lot. And in that light, I’m rather than [being] intimidated, I’m motivated, I’m inspired. And I look to that as in the community of creativity. And it’s like I say, years ago you had peers, we called it “peermanship,” that this almost like development-ship that doesn’t almost exist where companies are concerned in this era. Companies used to take young talent like you, people that were really dedicated to or wanted to be dedicated, and they developed you. You develop yourself these days. Unfortunately that’s become so digital at the end of the quest, concentrated by companies and people that used to be behind the desk, that what you have is 90 percent of the charts are repeat of what’s there. It’s like you can play ten records and basically they’re pretty much the same similar sample. I’ve listened to the radio, it’s like listening, you go to some discos, as they say, some dance places. Now they’re not called discos anymore, but interesting enough my feeling is that disco never went away, we just started calling it a little something different. Each ten years. Now it’s hip-hop or a combination of hip-hop and rap, but it’s still disco. And nothing wrong with that, because I love disco. I’ve had a couple of disco hits. However, the two for me is like from where we are and where it’s been, it’s like, uh... I was going to say something else, go ahead. Torsten Schmidt You talked a lot about how you thrive on an interview, how you get fed off affirmation. What do you do once the applause dies down? Leon Ware It’s always here anyway [points at his heart], I always feel it here. I was asked the question, how do I feel when I was coming up in the business and I would walk into an A&R man’s office and he would take and — ’cause this happened — just totally destroy your song? You know, it’s like, “Man, this particular part sucks and you should have put the bridge a little earlier.” The way they treat your work isn’t necessarily complimentary, and in fact, is disrespectful and you have to be strong enough. Like I said to the young lady, for me, I’ve always loved what I do so much that about the time I play for anybody, if they didn’t like it, I loved it so much, it didn’t really make a difference. So I always insist when I’m speaking or I have something to say that’s being listened to, especially in the creative process, the strength of your work will be determined by the love that you have for what you are doing. Not for the accolade that you’ll get from others, or the appreciation. It will start from you, and by you loving your work to the extent that you are supposed to, it won’t be bad work. It will be work that you’ll be proud of, you won’t have to worry about. Then, unfortunately or fortunately, we do have critics that criticize everything, you know? There is going to be somebody that is going to find something wrong or something that they didn’t like about something you did. Again, that’s cool. Some of it is motivating. Some of it is enlightening. Some of it can help you grow. I listen to everything, even that which I can’t use, or you find that out after it goes in. However, it’s a process of you... I also said this afternoon, I was speaking to somebody about the writing process, “organic” is a word I like using. Not so much because using an organ of some kind, but the idea of being very internal when you decide that you like something. As we go through the process of writing, we have a million different ideas. And I didn’t make the phrase, but I don’t mind using it, because it’s true. The process is, as I was told as a young writer, “You must realize when you’re polishing a turd and you’re not.” [audience laughs] Torsten Schmidt Who told you that? Leon Ware A very, very old young man. A friend of mine. He is not in the business, he just had a very nasty attitude about certain things, but that particular phrase I remember because all it meant was just, as the ideas come, you have to be objective and note the ideas that deserve your time. You have to be very objective. For me, objective is being organic. When it comes through here [points at his belly] is when I know that I should spend some time on it. Lots of times, I hear things because I’m listening all the time and as being able to play a little bit, I’m always hearing things. As I say, I can do from three to five tracks a day, you know? As far as ideas are concerned, there will be one that will be rich. Really, really rich. And again you just asked me the question, “How do you know when you are in love?” As I said before, that is not a question you’ll ask, you’ll know that. It’s the same thing when you write a song that you really like. The only thing I want add to that, it’s not a contradiction, but it’s a bit of a story I’ll tell you about not being the judge of your work. One of my copyrights is a song called “I Wanna Be Where You Are” — that was Michael Jackson’s first gold record as a solo artist — but this was the seventh or the eigth song in a demo session that I was about to leave the studio ,because I didn’t think this song was a strong song. The guy that was the head of the… He was the representative of [indiscernible] at the time, he had been there the day prior to that and heard this song, and said. “Leon, that last song, that one that, Oh, oh, oh...” I said, “Yeah, it’s OK, I don’t really like it.” He says, “Oh, no no no, please put that down.” He had to actually convince me to put the song down. The story goes that two days later I get a call, “They love it, it’s a smash, man, it’s going to be a smash!” I’m thinking this is going to be one of the four or five songs that I thought were some of my best work, right? [shakes his head] Again I say, it was the lesson then. Don’t be your critic. Finish your work, let somebody else be your critic. At that time had I been my critic, that song would have not been heard. It’s an interesting process. Once you love something, I wouldn’t second guess myself. It wasn’t a song that I loved until I heard Michael’s voice on it, because there were still several other songs I thought were so much better. I insist on being organic. When I’m working with people, when we start something, it’s finished. I don’t think if I have ever started a song I didn’t finish. Torsten Schmidt Which goes for everyone in this room, I guess. Leon Ware Well, some people do start songs that they don’t finish. I call them the quick thinkers, kind of like people that make almost good sex, you know? [audience laughs] Torsten Schmidt That’s a bit harsh. So, speaking of which, is there something like a work routine for you? When you get up in the morning, do you have to, I don’t know, a certain paper or a certain type of juice or something to get going? Leon Ware No, I’m totally untrained, unconditioned. Everything is very [long pause] organic. I’m serious because I have been asked the question before in another way. Do I have a process? No, in fact, I stayed away from any kind of process because I want it to be instinctive, I want it to be inspired by the moment. I want to approach it in exactly the way it happened, you know? And if you have a particular way of doing things or you have a set way of starting something, I feel like you might miss another process. In the way that I approach it, I let that feeling be what it is. I don’t want it to be something or expect it to be something. I kind of open my door and let whatever the feeling is come in and dress it up to as much of a possibility as my creativity will allow me to and the rest is the rest. If I was to say, out of the amount of songs that I have written since, I would say 1960 — I go back but... I have written a lot of songs, and, again, many of them that didn’t get heard [whispers] I thought were awesome. And I still think they are awesome, but the lesson is, like I was told before also in my young career, “Don’t go in with just one song.” And the idea is, to exaggerate the point, be as prolific as you possibly can be because the ideas are waiting in the wings, so to speak, and the more you work and the more you do what you do, you give all your ideas a chance to come out. And I think, for me, my process is as like right now I get up every morning, I do a two or three-hour bike ride seven days a week and I don’t go in my music room unless I’m ready to write. Torsten Schmidt But writing meaning you are sitting down on the keyboard or do you...? Leon Ware Sitting here, I can’t... [plays the keyboard] Torsten Schmidt Wait, here. [switches keyboard on] Leon Ware She is sleeping right now. [speaks to the equipment] Honey, honey. It’s a lady. My computer is a lady. [audience laughs] Torsten Schmidt So you were really lucky when you were introduced the track pad? Leon Ware I’ll also say something to you that is really funny. Have you seen the big Apple screens? The ones that are like this. [shows the size with his hands] The one before they made the one that I have at home, which is a 30-inch one, the one that’s like this [shows size] and that has two legs like this [draws legs in the air]... Well, the interesting thing about the computer is — as I do address my computer as a lady — when my tech was putting all the equipment together, when he got down to actually turning the computer on, he said to me, “Leon, you might want to do this yourself.” I said, “Why?” and he said, “Because where the button is, you’ll like it. You have to do your fingers just like that.” [fondles around and laughs out loud] Then he said, “I wouldn’t want to do that to her the first time being that she’s yours.” Leon Ware You know what, I always come prepared to do the supplement when you are dealing with this. I would like to play a few pieces of work that I have had some success with and some demos that other people just love them. Torsten Schmidt Are we going to play? Leon Ware Hmm. Play this right here, which would be… [camera cuts to new section] Up until that that after quality control there was hands down, 100-percent acceptance. One of the first albums. That thing is really, really, really great. Again I have nothing but positive things to say about most of everything that happened I just look at one thing that I feel like I continue the stress, and that is premise. Why you are doing what you are doing? For sure I am sure you know that it starts with loving this and the second is loving this. It is very good, loving this. Because everything that you may think I am and everything I may think I am and everything that I may want to be, at the end of the day all I am is a heart wanting to express itself. Period. I genuinely love everything that I create. I don’t work at it. It works me and I love it, and so I could, if we had a piano I would play a couple of things. But there is tomorrow and I am going to be doing another session right? Torsten Schmidt We might do it upstairs. Leon Ware OK, and I would have a better opportunity to… I don’t play great keyboards, but I am always complimented by some really brilliant people by the chords that I come up with. Even people that I would say classically trained and working with me always say, “And you don’t read?” No, I am not studied in the way that I could have studied because I’d say around 19 years old I was getting ready to take a course on theory and the teacher seen me from across the room. She stood there, she said she was there for a good 10 minutes and she walked to me and she says, “You don’t need lessons.” The same thing Quincy told me. I was taking a course in theory and Quincy begged me to stop I stopped, because the idea is that what I have is a gift, what I hear is a gift, the way I hear, my whole application in music totally gifted because what I do it takes a lot of people a long time to do. I come up with it quickly and as Quincy said to me leaned over my shoulder as I was playing a chord, he said, “If you knew what you’re doing you would scare yourself.” I really know that I am always pleased sometimes, especially times when I’ve been in the room late at night and I leave the room and I come back following something that I’ve worked on and how can I keep words when I say it, “But I couldn’t have played that.” It is really beautiful. It is so beautiful discovering yourself. That’s another thing I want to stress is that in your lifetime, as you grow, the one beauty I want to stress is that we have certain substances in this planet, from cocaine to heroin and grass and different things. Unfortunately for me, there was a period in my life that from peermanship I did allow myself to do certain things. I wouldn’t want to be quick in this point with you. There’s a substance that you already have that will never be exceeded by anything that you can take: You. Nothing richer than that. I can only leave you with the thought that I said to my son and to different people that I hope are listening. Substances, they’re tricky. You feel good, or you think you feel good, but there’s nothing on Earth richer. As I say to my son now, “I smoke me.” I get high... I get a high on me. There is no better high, and no safer high than that. Torsten Schmidt OK, for all us lovers still in the making and not on the senior ranks of the game, saying... Leon Ware Am I in the senior ranks? Okay? Torsten Schmidt Champion-level four-star general, something like that? Leon Ware All right. Torsten Schmidt Moving up the ranks, and I mean just going to someone you don’t know and saying, “Hey lady, smoke me,” is probably not exactly a subtle approach. Can you let us in on, you know, your trade secrets? Leon Ware [long pause] I think “smoke me” sounds good. [laughter and applause] The song that I’m going to create as soon as me and Tony go upstairs, I have this idea already in my head. It’s actually in part to... Is Reuben in the room? The singer, the Brazilian singer, Reuben, is he in the room? I was playing something from his CD last night, and the rhythm got to me and I had this idea and I said to him, “Damn, that’ll work really well with this, because it’s that…” [makes a skittering sound with his voice] Again, don’t blush. I am excessively nasty. You think in terms of your tongue doing that. [makes the sound again] Ladies can also address that outlook as well, and it then makes you think of... See, because this is the lesson I’m trying to teach. As a sensual minister and a person that relies on... Not only relies. I want to stress sensuality in most of my work. So when I hear certain things that kind of, you can put this piece here, you can sing the right phrase over the right chord, and it’s like putting some oil on a booty. [laughter] What do you want? I’m trying to be as explicit as I can here, you know? Torsten Schmidt Now that you put the oil on the booty, verbally. Reality check, chances are it’s not that wanted in nine out of ten cases, maybe. Next step, how do you go on about seducing someone that’s not totally inclined directly by the taste of your great smoke? Leon Ware The thing is, I was also going to add to, how did you say the first line? “Smoke me”? Was it “smoke me”? Was it just “smoke me”? Torsten Schmidt That’s what you said. Leon Ware OK. Torsten Schmidt I was kind of like, too shy, you know? Leon Ware I was going to add to that. There’s the question of good sex and... I don’t know if it’s possible to have “bad sex,” but there’s good sex and there’s sex, OK? In that light, and it being questioned like this, what you have is, you get out of the moment what you put in it. Interestingly enough, if you’ve got a partner that’s not putting out what you’re putting in it, you need another partner. Period. There is a mutuality in all of us, instinctively. We don’t have to work at it. It’s there. It’s waiting to be addressed, believe me. I’m a bit of an authority on that. This feeling isn’t something that we have to manifest, we have to work at, we have to look for. What we have to do is decipher who is the person that can take that feeling to the place that we want it to go. In that process, it’s learning how to be a lover. A lover, a great lover, is a lover that has... You give, and you take. You lend yourself. You give of yourself. Not where you’re equating your giving, you give. Interestingly enough, like I say, the more you love something, the more you’re loved back. I can swear to you, I’ve had moments that could’ve been disastrous, but because of me insisting... Not insisting in a physical way, but insisting that this was a moment it was supposed to work and not allowing that second guess that’s going on – because interestingly enough maybe in your process of making love in your lifetime, you have moments where you wonder. OK, you came, but you didn’t really come. You were involved, but you weren’t really involved. I’m going to make this short, hopefully. As it was put to me, this point is not mine, it’s by an older lady, me being a 28 year old young man, and she made a point to me that sticks with me as a man going into 66 years old. She said, when you work at something, when you work at it to make it right, it ain’t right. It’s just supposed to happen. When you get in the way of it is when you work at it. Period. I learned this very simply. It’s the simple act. You ever heard the word “foreplay”? Foreplay is if you want to call it, it is the process of a magical orgasm. You can either have great sex, or you can have sex. When the process is right and both people are... It’s like when you’re collaborating with somebody, I can use the same analogy. Collaboration is just like making love. You get in the room with the person, and you both do like this. [moves hands back and forth in front of him] Give and take. In and out. Torsten Schmidt Is that the right moment to talk about Minnie Riperton? Leon Ware The right moment to talk about Minnie? Yes, we can talk about Minnie, because as that song was, I can say a double entendre meaning. As what kind of person Minnie was, I say immediately she was a mother to everybody she met. She loved you instantly. She looked at what you were wearing, assessed as to whether it was enough, whether you needed a scarf on or anything. She really was a very, very sweet person. Also I learned something that really hurts. [long pause] She died from breast cancer. Being someone that was so religiously healthy, and always after everybody about what they were eating, their intake, whether it was a substance or not, you know, or whatever. So conscientious about her health and about others’ health, and to have that happen to her was one of the things that I learned in life that is inescapable. There is no chart in life on when we go and how we go. There’s the biggest lesson I had was my daughter died two years ago, who was 31 years old. Not the same cancer, but the lesson is that in life, we face things that are not where we are questioned. Nobody knocks on the door and says, “You ready for this?” Life is a series of challenges. I think at best, what we do, what I want to do with my challenges, is hopefully they make me stronger. The sadness of losing someone never goes away. However, there is such a richness at a moment in your life where you can say I lost something but I gained something at the same time. A very difficult paradox to really explain, but it is something that does make you richer than the experience. I thought about suicide at that moment. But then, on the other hand, my daughter wouldn’t have loved me to do that. And at the same time, in speaking of it the week before she passed, it was like she understood that all of us will understand at some point in our life. It’s not about who, or how. It’s life. Life’s experience. It’s unfortunately very random. We try to put a fix on it and a time of various studies or whatever. But the reality of it is, we wake up in the morning to a series of challenges that we have to meet. Many of them, we are not ready for. And many of them, we are. I’m looking at the planet that I live on and I see a world that is actually missing a point. One major point. I won’t go on with this because this is my pet peeve. And I could talk about it all day. A planet that is so rich, we have such a beautiful opportunity here but, as I said before, the word “love,” which is what we are to each other... I make a very simple point. You can look at the person next to you and think that that’s another individual but, in short, everybody in this room, all of us, are a part of each other. The day that we really realize that is when we will all realize the true value of each other. Right now, we haven’t seen a time on the planet yet where we have really exploited our strengths. We’ve been very insecure and very, very, let’s say vicious in that insecurity. I hope that me and you and our plight as messengers will say things that will make the world that we love, that we live in, come together. Because my personal feeling is, the wars and all the dissension and all the bullshit, it can stop in a second. All we have to do is stand up and turn around to each other. I won’t close with this, but Martin Luther King’s daughter was given an award. I was at this particular session. She stood up and she something that I’m glad to be able to share with you, because it’s very short. She said, “I’ll tell you all a story. A professor was teaching a class of 60 children for about six months. And he came after the six months and said, ‘I’m going to ask you all a question on your graduation.’ The question is, can you tell me the difference in day and night?’” Half the class did their assessment of what day and night was. Between 24 hours and some was scientific. After half the class did this, one of the students stood up and said, “OK teacher, we did this. We’ve gone through this. Tell us what day and night is.” The teacher said immediately, “When you can look at any human being, be his size, or her size, her color, or whatever, and know that that is your brother or your sister, you have realized day. If you cannot do that, you’re still in night.” Torsten Schmidt How did you learn to overcome, as Kanye calls it, your insecurities? Leon Ware My insecurities have been very few, I was busy as a teenager. [laughs] When I say busy, I had a lover. I come from the streets of Detroit. Torsten Schmidt Which is a different city than Detroit today? Leon Ware It’s not only a different city, it’s a different “-ity.” The streets of Detroit had a higher level of skullduggery. You can take your pick. From childhood to when I left Detroit at 19, I had learned everything you could do to make some money in the streets. I knew how to do it very well, unfortunately. And interestingly enough, you didn’t have too much time to be insecure. I say again, growing up in that city was like being prepared for any place on this planet — any war zone — I’m talking about you could not find yourself in any place where you feel intimidated. As a kid growing up, I have seen people get their head chopped off in cold blood. By the time I was ten years old, I had seen every atrocity you can think of one-on-one, right in front of me, you know? And fortunately now we have Washington DC, which now has the title of being the murder capital of the United States. Where Detroit for a good 30, maybe 40 years was from the era of the gangsters and Chicago and stuff, Detroit was always in that mix and a big part of the mix. But again, my insecurities are others. [pauses] People. As I have said before, I’m blessed with a talent that I never really had to guess about. My guessing has always been people who will either be good or be bad. Again, it’s the blessing to know that you do something that everybody likes, and it’s been that way since I was three years old. So again, that’s also the reason why my ego isn’t in a place where I have seen people that are rivals, where they are stars and they have this attitude, this “I want you to kiss my ass”-attitude. And to me that’s, first, a sign of insecurity, and second, a huge sign of not really knowing who you are. For the most part, I think the insecurity factor is something that’s human, I think we all have a bit of it. For mine, I’m like a seven year old. And I always classify myself as seven and a half years old, you can ask my wife. I watch cartoons religiously on Saturday morning and you can get extremely insulted if you bother it. I have a child inside of me that will not grow up. I remember being at that age and having somebody say, “You have got to act like a grown-up!” And me thinking to myself, “If I got to act like what I have seen with grown-ups, I’m staying a kid.” I instinctively want love, I’m just this seven and a half year old kid that’s still wondering why the rest of the world doesn’t want to have fun. [audience chuckles] I’m serious. I give you another story... Torsten Schmidt Which brings us to your note maybe. Leon Ware No, I’m going to tell you a story about my childhood. I was blind for two years as a child. I shot this eye out with a slingshot. [points at his right eye] And I had to learn braille. I graduated from the same school that Stevie Wonder went to. I was not supposed to have vision according to technical medical knowledge. But my mother’s prayers brought my vision back, I say, she says. But in the process of being blind and going to school with blind kids, I learned one thing that I would love to share with every human being. Especially all of us that call ourselves caucasians, black, the different nationalities, I would like to share one thing: Blind people don’t see color. [pauses] Blind people see you! That’s the reason why I am really good at assessing people. Because I close my eyes constantly, I don’t even look at the piano when I’m playing. It’s not fool-proof, because we got some people that are very brilliant about lying. [laughs] There are some artistic people that know how to prefabricate and say exactly what you want to be said. But for me, like I said, I’m a simple kid. I’m a little seven and a half year old kid, saying, “Let’s have a good time,” you know? I’ve grown to be a grown man and I doubt that assesses sometimes too much. I definitely see everything because I don’t watch. And when I’m looking at people, I’m not looking at them. One time on stage, I got on stage and immediately asked the people in the club, “Please turn the lights out.” They turned the lights out, completely dark for a second and then I asked them to turn them back on. I said, “Now you know who I am.” Because what it is, I — as I said to the young lady that was taking pictures of me today — I said, “Sixty-five, going on 66-years old. I look in the mirror daily.” I’m still somewhat conceited, if you want to say. I like me, but I also see the age. I don’t kid myself, but I said to her, “It’s not my outside that I’m interested in anyway. It’s inside that I’m caring about, you know?” This is what I think all of you want your world around you to know, you know? We may be a different color, but I can guarantee you [whispers] we are the same. [pauses] Close your eyes, you don’t have to see me, but if you close your eyes, you will see me. I can’t close them now because I want some questions now. Torsten Schmidt Probably before that, are you one who looks or who closes your eyes? Or do you always close the eyes in intimate moments? Leon Ware Aah, I told you I was a freak, right? [laughs] Let me address that. There are moments when you are feeling so good, you don’t even have to ask your eyes to close, they just instinctively close. [laughs] And then there are times when you really want to close your eyes. That’s another thing that happens. It’s like when you are being stroked properly and your eyes go in the back of your head. [laughs / holds his hands up] Excuse me! You are all grown, so it’s OK! Those times I just say, you don’t have to ask your eyes to do anything, you don’t have to ask yourselves to do anything. I said to Manu [of the Red Bull Music Academy crew] yesterday — I’m good with philosophical phrases, whether they mean anything, I’m sure they mean something but whether they mean anything to the person I’m saying them to, but I say them anyway because it’s from the heart. I said, “There are things that we are, there are things that we need. I think the things that we are outweigh the things that we need, because what we are is what we need already.” In other words: This earth that we live on, this earth that you have in you, is waiting for you to grow into the person that you want to be. When you pray, I believe that there will be a day every Earthling will wake up and we will pray to ourselves because we are god. The god is not out there or buddha or wherever. God is in here. [points at his breast] You do not have to go to a church to get on your knees or whatever to pray to god. God is here [points at his breast], you are part of god. I truly believe that every religion, regardless to whether it is Buddhism, Catholicism, whatever it is, all leads to the same door. It’s just different names. Always leads to the same door. We are a part of each other, the more we realize it, the stronger we will become as a species. And as far as race is concerned, man has played with that issue for a couple of thousand years, and I do hope we get to the point where even if it’s just the point, “Hey, we have been fucking ourselves up enough! Time out!” Look at it like it is, if it’s not religious, if it’s not race, if it’s not... Oh, let me also stress this one thing: Power. We haven’t seen it yet, we haven’t realized the power that we are yet. There hasn’t been a king on this planet that wanted to make every other man a king. When we have a true king, that king will make every other man a king. When we have a true leader, that true leader will make everybody else a leader. My outlook is, until we are banned in our insecurity to look at each other and not be afraid, and look at each other straight-on and say, “I love you because you are part of me.” When we get to that, that’s what I’m putting in my songs and in my nasty way, but it’s all about doing this [folds his fingers], getting us together, you know? Each of you in this room will have your own individual way of making your point. But we are messengers and I truly believe we are more accountable about our messages, the richer we will be to the community we are serving. And that’s what we are: Messengers serving our messages to the people of this planet, you know? Maybe there are some of them out there, too. I am definitely into aliens, I think Starbucks is definitely owned by aliens. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt Well, speaking about another church that you worship, what’s your role in the church of Deep Throat? Leon Ware Ooohohoho... [audience laughs] Torsten Schmidt You know, talking politics and stuff. Leon Ware I can tell you this story because it’s OK, everybody has died. Me and a gentleman that I was writing with — actually he was my mentor as a lyric writer, his name was Bob Period — when I met him he lived on the top of the hills in Beverly Hills. Bentley, Rolls Royces, everything and then I walked in and I saw that jukebox and it’s as big as this and has a hundred hits. All of them were his. He wrote the lyrics to ‘Alice in Wonderland’. The man was in my estimation what you call a genius, he was a lyrical genius. He said to me that people were asking him, “Bob, how do you continue to come up with all these ideas?” The same thing I said before about making love, he always said, “I never try.” He said to me about the process in itself, “Leon, check any of my lyrics out and if you have to ask me what I meant, I didn’t write the story.” In other words, when you write a line, there are some writers that are really good at being clever and they have lines that are very colorful, poetic and some of them are brilliant, because they do say exactly what they mean. However, the most potent writers on this planet are writers, when they write a line, you don’t have to ask them what they meant. You get the meaning instantly. I think that’s what I was trying to address about that point. But I want to say something else to that because I didn’t start writing lyrics until he said to me one afternoon... I was singing something before he came in the room, and he actually had listened to it a bit, “You have a unique approach of how you say things.” Which is also a talent, you know. Because I think the best analogy for writing a lyric is when you listen to a song and you instantly say, “Damn, I follow the same thing.” Bingo! Because that’s the trick of what we do as lyricists – writing something that instantly most people can relate with. The rest is like, I like to have fun. And as I say, I’m a 100 percent instigator. I like playing with the do’s and the don’ts. Always in a good way, never malicious, never vicious. I do hope that I have said something that is useful, I do hope. Torsten Schmidt You totally did, especially on that one, but I’m somehow a little lost here because I think you started of explaining what your involvement with the Deep Throat soundtrack was and we got off on a little tangent. Leon Ware Oh, I was trying to get out of it. However, the story goes that me and Bob were working on a movie before he passed away, and a year after he passed away a friend of mine called me up and says, “Leon, I’m down here in the Pussycat Theatre, I’ve just seen a movie called ‘Deep Throat.’ Man, you should come down here.” I said, “OK,” and I didn’t really have to be convinced, I wanted to see ‘Deep Throat’ anyway. I had heard about it. He says, “Come down here man because the second song in the movie, I could swear it’s your voice.” So I go down, I listen, and as soon as the second song comes up, I know it’s me because it’s an effect that I did. I took a straw, put it in a glass and then [blows] and you can hear the bubbles, right. But the next line is [sings]، “Bubbles! Great big magic, bubbles!” [laughs] Of course, the ladies are saying at the time, this is classic, before they come, “Do you mind if I smoke while you eat?” [laughs] Anyway, I go back after the show, after the movies are off, I call the lady who is the wife of [Bob Period], I said, “You ought to come down to the theater because there is a couple of Bob’s songs.” It was one of mine and three of his, because what they did was they took three to five songs — we had about seven in the movie — and just took them. It turns out, four or five days later after we were trying to investigate who the people were and so forth, I’m sitting in her house and the phone rings and her being Caucasian, you know when you guys get upset, you get red. And the phone rings and she says, “Yes,” and her face gets a little red, and she says, “Yes” again and her face gets redder, and she says “Yes” one more time and the phone is shaking as she puts it down. I say, “Jackie, what’s wrong?” And she said, “Well, that was the guy on the phone that said [in a dangerous voice], ‘Are you Mrs. Elliot?’” She says, “Yes.” “We understand that you want to find out who owns the rights to ‘Deep Throat.’ She said, “Yes.” [in a dangerous voice] ”Mrs. Elliot, are you listening?” She said, “Yes.” [in a dangerous voice] “Forget it.” [laughs] Now, your laughter will be at this: 20 minutes to 40 minutes later the lawyer that we had investigating it, calls and says, “Jackie, you know about that picture ‘Deep Throat.’” She says, “Yes, but sure I want to...” “No, no, Jackie, let me tell you something: Forget it!” [laughs] As it turns out, if you go online, because the story is there now, they are actually bold enough to tell the story, because it is online, my wife and me read it the other night — it’s the first time to see that — where they told the story that the Gambino family was [involved]. You have heard of those guys? They took it and they just, what’s typical of the mafia, they [hands out], “It’s yours this week, it’s yours this week, it’s yours next week.” And for the past 30 years it has been a lot of people’s ownership. But of course, the other issue was is, I have never stood up to say it was my voice because my knowledge of the mafia was very clear. [laughs] If you know the mafia, you don’t call to say, “Hey, I want what’s coming to me, man.” [laughs] Instead, on the other side they are like, [in a gangster voice] “Ey, Charlie, this guy Leon Ware wants what’s coming to him. Let’s take care of him. Oh, by the way Charlie, check out his cousins and all of his good friends because we don’t want to leave any grieving relatives, right?” [laughs] Now, 30 years later, I’m 65, even the lady that was the publisher died two or three days ago, so my wife and my sisters, don’t go crazy [in a female voice], “I’m not going to go crazy.” I had had some plans. I told Robin that I was going to disclose this information that maybe we should do a real intimate picture session so I could take off something, you know, maybe get fully erected and [looks down], “Uh, check this out!” [laughs] No, no, no, listen, because it’s the funny part because – the only thing I must say about the ‘Deep Throat’ movie is because, in leaving, Jackie had this one thing to say, she insisted – I’m not bragging or anything — but she said to me as we are walking along, “Leon, they actually cheated, you know because she hasn’t had what we call deep throat, has she?” [laughs / takes his arms up] It’s true. Proud. Touché my brother. Some questions, please. Audience Member Yes, I got two questions. They always talk about how Marvin Gaye had these many demons, and I was wondering if he had a nervous breakdown or anything, or how was he acting around you? Leon Ware Marvin was, as I said, very similar, very idealistic. Idealistic people are extremely sensitive, they treat things in a deeper form than a lot of people do and the way me and Marvin differed, is Marvin clinged to disappointments. He did not... Audience Member He could not take criticism? Leon Ware It was not criticism, it was the pains that he had in his life from the marriages — or the marriage, his first marriage that didn’t work. He had a couple of other grievances in his life. He was Marvin Gaye, his father was gay, he had to live with the fact that his father was gay coming up. Also, being totally heterosexual and having the last name Gaye, it was a couple of issues that he dealt with, but he was as I am in the light of being another man. I was asked by a lady at a party one night, she was trying to make, I guess, the guys feel uncomfortable, because she asked a couple of guys the same question, “Do you know that you have a lady in you?” And I answered the lady quickly, I said, “Yes, 50 percent of me is female, but the lady in me is so in love with the guy, she can’t wait to get to him!” [laughter] So I’m excessively impressed with the fact that part of me is female and I said this to a dear friend of mine, “Any man that’s uncomfortable around a gay individual, you better check yourself out.” Because I have got a lot of friends that I love dearly that are gay. I feel the gay people are getting the same slack and the same bullshit that black people get, that women get, you know? A false, very disrespected outlook about who and what they are. We are not supposed to be equating who and what we are – I don’t say when I say what I’m supposed to be. I think what it is, is that there is a lot of misspent time in our lives on this planet where we have the audacity to someone else’s bedroom and tell them what we feel about it. My feeling is this, I said about 15 years ago to a very dear friend of mine who is as gay as lord on the Earth — this guy wishes he was a woman on Christmas – OK? I said to him, “The only thing I feel is if I were gay, there would be no question about me saying to the world: You can kiss my ass. I am who I am, I love who I am, and I’m not asking you to be who I am.” And I would say to anybody that has that particular classification, love yourself enough whereas like I said about your work. You don’t ask nobody, you don’t even ask anybody, “Is my work OK?” You ask yourself that first. By the time you release that work for somebody else, even your close friend to hear it, you’ve listened to it enough to know that now it’s time, now I can play this for somebody. Because believe me, nobody other than my wife — and she hears about only by proxy through the wall — nobody hears anything of mine until… It’s like, I can’t hit on a woman because I hate being rejected. You know, and I have been that way since I was a teenage boy so I know how to get mine without hitting on ‘em. [laughs] Hey, we all got a style! You know, mine is real free and it’s like the same thing about making love. Once somebody knows that you are in the room with him and you are on the same page... As like my sister said, being a young man and have four older sisters, by the time I was 20 years old, I had been schooled very well about the other side. I wasn’t the young boy, that — a lot of young men think that when they are going out they cop. No, when they are going out, they are going out to be copped. Because most of the time you think you are copping? Eh eh, you ain’t copping, because she was waiting for you. [laughs] You know, that’s the game that women play because their approach is — we go out the masculine style to allure — they go out, they have already allured. But they got something we want and they do that feminine thing that we love so much. That’s the reason why we are here. [laughter] So god bless ’em, and all I can say is that, again I hope I’m saying something that is useful. I’m here because the meaning of you all being here was the meaning that drew me here. It’s like I have been invited to different things that I have not made myself available to, because the feeling that the premise and the meaning wasn’t what I wanted to be involved in. This is something that after my wife, of course, has seen the whole tape and she was very excited about it, I was very excited about it after looking at half of the tape, because I’ve heard one young man who was from San Francisco making a phrase [turns to Torsten] and you might know who this was, it was in the video that you sent. He was from San Francisco and he made the phrase, he was a DJ, he said, “I do this...” Same thing I say. I can’t remember exactly what he said ver batim but he said, “I do this because I love it.” The whole energy about what this is, is people from all over the world, different parts of the whole planet are coming to communicate, to share their feelings, to do what a nasty guy like myself would think could happen. Not that orgies are something that I participate in, but it’s almost like a creative... Torsten Schmidt Orgies are scheduled at 11. Would 11 be convenient for you? [audience laughs] Leon Ware Excuse me, have you got the oil? [laughs] Torsten Schmidt Always, it is sitting right next to me. Leon Ware I am 150 percent. I feel the ideas that we all have waiting in the wings, you know? Audience Member My next question is, as far as like MCs and hip-hop, clearing samples from you, have any of them tried to play you out? What was their name? Was there anybody big that didn’t want to pay you, disrespect you by not even clearing it or whatever? Leon Ware I have not had that problem because, in response to that question – kind of kike that question from somebody else – most of the rappers from 2Pac to Ice Cube... I mean, I have been sampled by almost all of them. The current thing with Mary J. Blige. And Puffy and couple of other things that are out, and there are some more things coming out next month or in January but not... See, because what happened, I think, when rap started really getting big and it was like the Wild West and guys were just taking people’s stuff, you know? What happened was they started losing everything. See, because they were taken to court, it was clear out plagiarism and whatever percentage they had of the work that they did, they lost completely and that became so emphatic across the board every time anybody would get caught stealing or taking a piece of somebody’s song. They have since now come up with the plagiarism law, that’s a bit different. See, because when I was coming up you had to have eight consecutive bars — both melody and chords — in order to have a plagiarism case. In today’s world, they have a thing where, I think, it’s four bars and if you have the sentiment, as they say — if you have the sound or the sentiment of that piece — that’s plagiarism. I’ve only had two outright thefts in my career, and one was by one of the biggest stars of black history, I’m not going to say his name but because I don’t want to put people out, but actually two... Torsten Schmidt Who was that? Leon Ware I won’t say names. Can I have a tissue, someone? [stands up, someone hands him a tissue] I’m OK, I’m OK. Audience Member What was the song? Leon Ware If you listened to their repertoire, it’s like both of them were in the top tens or they got gold records, both of each artist. And if you listen to their top ten greatest hits, you won’t have to ask me. Fortunately, for me what has followed me in my career is that my uses of chords is my signature. Again, I don’t know what I’m doing but it has caused me to have a few what we call hits, and you can listen to my work with other people and discern the parts that I wrote. I think that’s great, I think we all should reach for identity. That’s one thing that’s dwindling in this particular era where so much sounds alike, you know? You should endeavour to as you are do in your... You should hook it up as uniquely in your style, so that as things progress they can say, “That’s so and so’s thing.” That’s how you [climb up the ladder]. [raises his hands over one another / points at someone in the audience] What’s your name, darling? Audience Member Anya. Leon Ware Anya? She was saying to me last night about the different DJs that don’t have the slant or the proper sensitivity to the art that they are doing. It was only until about three years ago that I realized that DJs were as popular as, let’s say, as creative as they are. My first impression of DJs, because I was on the road with a young man named Carl Craig, who is also from Detroit but a very, which I found out, very popular, very famous DJ, right? He happened to tell me some of the fees that he gets in going to various countries. I mean moneys, amounts of moneys. I want you all to know, my first comment to him was this, “Fuck, I missed the boat, man.” [laughter] I call it the smartest manifestation — I thought that sampling was slick. DJs are the slickest. They take your shit, they rearrange it, now they are artists. It’s not like they are really ripping anybody off, I just say it’s a brilliant manifestation. They take your shit, make it their own by the way that they play it — the sequences that they play — because I think the power of a DJ is the first song isn’t the one that you really have to concern yourself with. It’s the same as Bob said about writing, “It’s not your first line that’s important, it’s the one that’s following.” So, a DJ’s thing is to have his things when as he sequences, you do it like this. [raises one hand over the other] And by the time you get here [raises hand to his head] you are hooked. If you watch most people by the time they are here [on top] you can’t say shit to them. They don’t want to hear anything else, leave them alone. So, it’s an art that I respect and I’m sure that many of you that are in here and that are DJs, can rest assured that it’s a lot bigger than I knew it was. It’s here to stay, and it’s fulfilling because it’s the same thing that I do as an artist that sings. You get in front of a thousand people or a 100 people, how many it is, but you get in front of these people [whispers] and you make them feel good. That’s what they come for. They come to be released, they come for you to serve them musically, beat-wise, what will take them out of their present moment. And that in itself is an art, so you can pat yourself and give yourself a hand. You know, please. For me [claps], all of you that are DJs. Audience Member I wanted to ask you if you ever changed songs when somebody told you to do so? Or how would you approach that? Leon Ware When I have finished an idea, I play it for somebody and I listen to their opinion. I don’t leave with that opinion, though. I leave with mine. It’s important to be open. If it’s criticism, hopefully it’s constructive criticism. [to participant] Anya. Audience Member Thanks, hello, OK. Now, you keep saying, “I hope it’s useful what I’m saying for you guys, I hope it’s useful.” I just want to thank you for your words, really, because I think the knob twisting and everything is important but I think a lot of us need a little bit of the soul side of it as well. So really thanks a lot for your words, and I’m glad that you touched a bit on the sensual side of music-making because I think for a lot of people it’s taboo in a way, or people don’t admit it or open up to it. But for me, when I take the stage — I’m still working on the studio side — but when I take the stage it’s 100 percent what I’m there for. I’m making love to the crowd and I get so much out of it and it’s what drives me, really. But my question for you is, who are you making love to when you make your tracks? Like, you talk about the whole process that you describe, who is your lover when you make your tracks? Leon Ware Ahhhh, see... Audience Member Your instrument, yourself, your words, your goal for the track? Leon Ware My wife tries to nail me in the sense where... I was writing a song that was called “On the Beach.” I have lines in the song that, they could be classified as pornographic lines, “I’m in between her leg, my tongue is doing different things, I’m sucking nipples,” and stuff. She was asking me [imitates female voice], “Who did you write the song about?” [laughter] Audience Member I was just wondering... Leon Ware No, but my answer in short, like I said, I’m making love to the world. As odd as it might sound, but when I’m fantasizing I have a fixed individual, but as you say a fixed individual for a flashing woman because it was from that flashing woman, to another individual, to another individual... I think basically, I’m just driven by sensual urges and sensual innuendos and I never have to work at it. Every word that you say, if you make a phrase, I instinctively can connect it to something sensual. And I do. I don’t even think that it’s a talent, it’s just, I do it. And now, of course, for the past, say, 30 years or so, since I’ve been really into and like you say, the world around us is just a bit intimidated or some people feel a little uncomfortable about saying certain things, I’m just the contrary. I am that rebel that wants to raise the bar, that says, “Hey, not only should we not be afraid, we should be proud. Proud of who we are and what we are.” That part of our substance or our existence... I mean, I can get choked up right now I won’t, but I find it almost an audacity that we could have allowed ourselves as a species to look at that part of our function as taboo, wrong, or to be afraid of it. Recently I said, simple point, I said to a guy who was an interviewing me about six months ago who wrote an article, I said simply, “I’m not saying anything ingenious, I’m not bringing anything to the table that’s new. I’m only reminding the people that have a chance to remind very simply: Cherish where you come from.” And in that light, [whispers] you can get extremely nasty and be honorable. Very nasty in a very honorable way. Because anything that you say that alludes to sex can only be considered your ode to your origin. Oh, did I say that right? Touché: Ode to your origin, you know? Yeah. And in that light we are all one, a beautiful one. [looks at Torsten] And you can bring the oil up! [giggles] Torsten Schmidt One of the most difficult things is probably to wrap things up and let go sometimes. On a reissue there is extensive liner notes, and one bit talks a lot about Marvin Gaye’s wife talking about how she felt when she was a little younger in the actual recording process and how she felt like he was just singing for her and how she uses this record to play it to the kids now and all that kind of stuff. I mean, were you present and... ? Leon Ware Yes. Torsten Schmidt I mean, and how did it feel when you... ? Leon Ware She was right. There was a... Torsten Schmidt Those were initially your things and it already took a life of its own. Leon Ware It was so beautiful because what happened with that record was — again, this is another part of the story — Marvin had been recording... I don’t know if they just got married. Yeah, they just got married, and he was as in love as anybody could be. Genuinely in love. And I think probably that marriage had been one of Marvin’s happiest moments ever. It took us 13 months to complete the album. Why so long? Because six of the months we were playing basketball on studio time. But Marvin really was in love, he loved Janice. It’s like my wife says better, “Jan was his reward for the pain that he was feeling about the other relationships in his life.” I could guess. It was said. I don’t know this to be true. Marvin’s last tour, he made two attempts to kill himself. His process and his attempts were not good because he had a problem with the issue of suicide. His suicide is sacrilegious. The story goes, two weeks before his father killed him, he brought his father a gun. The day before the incident, he went to a house where his father lived and proceeded to kick his father’s ass. This story is not told but I can tell you all. Please don’t record this. It was intentionally done by Marvin. Marvin didn’t want to kill himself. He didn’t want to do it himself. But he took it to the man that brought him into the world, that he never got along with. Him and his father never really had any great father and son relationship. Went to their house, beat him up, and let his father leave the room. His father came back into the room and shot him. The story is told but, in essence, that part of the story, as far as where the gun came from. When this was told it was told by one of Marvin’s families so I know it’s not a lie. It made sense because there was an open, ongoing family dislike for each other. Father, son, family. Marvin figured it out. He said, “Well, if I can’t do it myself I know somebody that’ll do it for me.” As sad as it sounds, I only note that he was a troubled person. He, to me, was another gift to the world that, whatever you want to call, his time was too quick. Much too quick. But in the same light, we don’t have any charge of that. Torsten Schmidt To what extent do you think is being a troubled soul essential to producing great art? Leon Ware Lots of troubled souls do great art. Interestingly enough, I’m a bit of a troubled soul but mine is not only under control, mine is basically loving something and knowing that you won’t have the time to really do what’s necessary. I think, for the most part, Marvin and people like Marvin that have such strong passions, passions that exceed being consumed. Consumed is a word. There is a point of passion where consumed is only a word, because it is another level where you are that. It is everything and nothing else means anything. I could probably make a list of brilliant talents throughout time that were troubled souls that gave the world some phenomenal art, from picture art to paintings to dancers to... Interestingly enough they say, the more troubled an artist is, the more depth you get out of their strokes and their music and whatever. Could be true, because it’s the dark side that does seek light, needless to say. Audience Member Hello. It’s been a real pleasure listening to you for these hours. I guess I speak for all of us. If, for some reason, you just said you were confident and all, if for some reason you are doubting you got your point across I can assure you that it was really important listening to you. Leon Ware Thank you very much. Audience Member Having said this, and getting back to the topic of Marvin and the whole importance of his life to all of us, and not just as DJs I guess, Marvin Gaye must be the artist that everyone surely likes, or like Bob Marley or whatever. He’s really like consensual to everyone, and that’s partly my opinion because of the humanity in his body of work. And of course it’s transparent also within your words. Leon Ware [cellphone rings] Sorry. I thought it was off. It’s off now. Audience Member OK. So what I will try to ask you is, his music has been sampled so many times by different people and in different contexts, but I’m thinking, we have a track here on the laptop which is exactly called “Tribute to Marvin: The Day We Lost Soul,” and we were thinking we would like you to take a short listen... Leon Ware Can I? Audience Member Yeah. And comment on that. Leon Ware Yes, can I? Audience Member And if you feel it’s actually a tribute. If you feel it’s a tribute although it’s ... Leon Ware Can you bring it? Audience Member Yeah. We could put it on the speakers of the laptop but maybe it’s best to connect to the mixer and listen to it properly. Leon Ware I’ve been talking so much I wanted to – like my son says, you talk too much dad, when you get started. However I… Audience Member We will take care of it here. Leon Ware I don’t get the chance, I don’t get the opportunity to do this. Audience Member It’s another Detroit record by the way. Leon Ware Which one? Torsten Schmidt It’s the Moodymann one I guess. Audience Member So the question’s basically whether you agree it’s a proper tribute. Although this is like a record with perhaps a thousand copies, you know? Leon Ware Oh, I’ll answer you in a second. (music: Moodymann – “The Day We Lost the Soul”) Again, like you said, so many different interpretations and different treatments of various works of mine, and monetarily-wise I love it, creative-wise I appreciate and some of it I actually do love. But a hundred percent agree with because, first, for anybody in this room, with living 30 years and doing this for 30 years and people come into you after this process, and say they want to do something else with your work, I feel like it’s a plus. The only thing that I’ve got myself, me on one thing and the police was on a couple other things with this one, you have guys send you their idea of what they’re going to put out, and I’m low. And if you can make me feel like you’re really low, you have real gone past the point. Because especially with this current song that I’m just finishing, I’m saying that in things I’ve actually haven’t expressed on record because in actuality, but it’s again part of who I am. But bottom line, I like it. I like the variations. I think it gives a piece of work new life, and again the only time you have to reject a person’s particular slam or their approach to what they’re doing with a piece of work of yours is, like I said, if it’s tacky. If it doesn’t have any taste. Or especially, one of the things, this guy says, mmm let’s talk about some raunchy phases about how they did certain things with certain ladies and you know. It’s like hm, let’s give you a point. I went to an awards program about ten years ago in Atlanta, Georgia. Up until that time, I was like, most men my age, 60-ish, late 50s, kind of wondering how young women could really be getting off on the rap scene. I mean these guys come out the [grunts noisily] and it’s aggressive, it’s animal, it’s ugly, a lot of it’s disrespectful. Not today’s thing but looking at somewhat the scenario or the outlook of rap, hip-hop rap, my lesson was about to be taught. I watched Tony! Toni! Toné!, Stevie Wonder and different singers, they’re singing. I watched this crowd do their, [waving hands in the air]. I mean things like light the candle. I mean everything was going on just as I was used to seeing. My lesson was, when the singers stopped and the rappers hit the stage, those same people that had been swooning, some in their late 40s, 50-ish people, the younger ones as well, all those same people were responding to the singers in the way that singers get responded to. Soon as the rappers hit the stage, lesson number one, I watched those same people that were cool and suave and all this shit, they got up on the tables, hit the table, it was like [stands up and makes angry grunting sounds]. I said, “Oh I get it now!” I said because in my era, we were learning to pull the panties to the side. [laughter] Okay? In this world, they tearing the panties off. [laughter and applause] You know what I mean? It’s like, excuse me, it is so animal because, I got to say it to you, you have to see the two together to really get it. Because the same people that were swooning and doing all this, oh I light the candle, same people that we saw next to the rappers [loud grunting]. I said now I get it. These girls, sweet girls, we don’t like to think of it, but we are animals. And rap, and the context of rap, does this to you. [grunts] Like I said to Robin, you look at the pictures of young artists of this day, the only thing that’s missing is the number across their neck. [laughter] Because they don’t look like they trying to be your friend. They looking like, if you come around this corner I’m fucking you up. You know what I mean? Excuse me. Language is necessary because I want you to get the point. Anybody else? Audience Member Please, thank you very much. Hello Leon. Leon Ware Hello. Audience Member How you doing? Leon Ware I’m well. Audience Member Well, you’ve been really great today. Leon Ware I hope so. Audience Member You said some very inspiring things to me yesterday about time. We’ve just been talking about Marvin and how much time he had with us on the way, or with you. We are sharing time together over the next couple of weeks, we’re sharing time right now. Tell me about time. Leon Ware Time? I should tell you about time. I can tell you about my time, which, actually, you know what... Audience Member Sorry. How you view the time that we’re all allocated on the Earth to be a missile. Leon Ware I view it as a continuum. It’s like I said to somebody just recently before I came here. I said really people put thought because in this process, the only thing... I won’t say the only thing, but one major thing that I feel is missing is us really getting acquainted with each other. Just Earthlings getting acquainted with each other. We don’t do that. This kind of forum is a good beginning or a good process, or good part of that process. But I’ve said and I say it again, I hope that my being a part and your being a part will generate, will be seeds to other hearts, because this is the beginning of what I’m talking about. We are supposed to be about the task of magnifying each other, not diminishing each other. I’m supposed to do, in my time, what’s necessary for you to be your best in your time and on down the line. And once all of us on this planet realize how much we actually need each other is when we’ll realize – really realize – how strong we are. We haven’t seen anything yet. I’ll say also another favorite phrase of mine. We will, as I say we as humans, outgrow our ignorance. I truly believe that. I truly believe that the human spirit is much richer than what we’ve shown. I think we’ve just been in this circle which is consistently, like I said, at this point I’m hoping that most men, the brilliant minds on this planet will kind of come to the point that I myself consider myself a very simple-minded man, but even a simple-minded man can come to the same point – aren’t we tired? I mean, if we were doing something different to each other after two thousand years it would be something. Then we could question something. But we’ve been in the same circle for two thousand years. “I don’t like you for this, I’m going to cut you for that, don’t kill me for that.” You know what I mean? And none of that, none of it, is who we are. It’s like the basics of what we are and who we are are so drastic we miss because we’re so fucking scared of each other. Audience Member So, speaking on that do you think racism is like the ultimate test that god put on his earth for us to really challenge, because the way it was designed and it’s sort of like a game or sort of like to end up getting us all on one and loving one another. Do you think that’s like the ultimate goal? Leon Ware I think the best answer for that is, you’ve seen a rainbow, right? You’ve all seen a rainbow? Audience Member Yeah, yeah. Leon Ware You’ve all seen a rainbow? Lots of colors, right? And what’s the first thing you say when you see a rainbow? [pauses] “Ah, beautiful. Ah, beautiful.” You say, “That’s really beautiful.” Right? I don’t know but my biggest guess is that if there are makers of us — I have questioned that — but if there are makers of us, they intended this to be the same way I just expressed. This blackness and your whiteness and Asian and Spanish, and all these different things, they are supposed to make us say, [whispers] “Wow, beautiful.” Instead, what do we do? What have we done? We look at each other and we say, “Black men go across the earth and they intimidate. White men go across the earth and they get along.” But it’s like with the Irish thing, the Irish are fucking each other up for how many years over a point that you ask yourself... I have a very good friend of mine who is Irish and we had this conversation, but it’s interesting that you say to yourself: How can another man knock on your door and say, “Hey, you know, I’m ruling you. Fuck what you believe, I’m just ruling you. Let’s say whatever you believe, throw it away. I’m ruling you.” That’s Irish. That’s the Irish fight and there will be fighting for a long time. It’s the same thing with Israel and Palestine. Oldest war on the planet, but I did hear a guy that went to Palestine and to Jerusalem talking to regular people and if you close your eyes and you listen to each of both sides talking, all you can hear was, [in a threatening manner] “I ain’t going nowhere, this is my shit!” And the other side, “Hey, I ain’t going nowhere. This is...” And I had a conversation with a young man from Palestine who had years ago been sent to London because his parents were wealthy enough to send him there, he was driving a cab and I was in the back of the cab, we have been getting into a conversation. He pulled it out like, we had about half an hour, 45-minute talk, just sitting in the cab, he was like, “Do you know what this war and my country is about?” I said, “For years I heard a lot of different things but the most part I heard it was about a wall.” He was, “Oh, yes!” It’s about a wall, believe it or not. It started about a praying wall that Jerusalem said was theirs. Palestine says it’s theirs. My point was at this point of the conversation, I say, “Hey, why couldn’t they have said, “OK, yours for three and a half hours, mine for three and a half.’” He said, “It would have been too easy, man.” It would have been too easy and plus, at this point, they have been killing each other for so long, it’s no longer about the wall. It’s about how many people have died on these sides and the different grievances and plus, I won’t get really deep into politics but I will say this. If Americans wonder why 19 men would make themselves a bomb to make a point, if they are wondering, they haven’t been keeping up with the do’s and don’ts of America. Because America, unfortunately, has made some moves and are responsible for a demise around this planet in their quest for quietly doing what the Dutch did first, the British did second. Conquering the fucking world. And I say to you again, power. Power? True power is not about conquering anything at all. In fact, any man that’s truly powerful, he makes every man as powerful as him because he knows his power. Unfortunately, on this planet we have had leaders that have been guessing and totally unsure about their part because everything that they exhibit was oppression. And even at this point, every nationality on this planet — black, white, all of us, every nationality — separately enslaved their own first. And I say it’s a known, if you psych it out. Why? Because we are afraid. Men are afraid of each other, of themselves, of their own community and then they spread it around, so over the years you have had these different conquerers from Genghis Khan to Rome and the different things and it’s like a big circle that continues to do the same thing. [draws a circle] Kill and conquer, kill and conquer. And in the war in Iraq, a lot of people could guess what it’s about. We’ll find out in maybe ten years the actual truth, because what’s really good about this particular time that we are dealing with, we’ve got magnifying glasses up your ass! Excuse me, but that’s where it is and very little that you do now on this planet that cannot be or will not be deciphered. So the truth of this war or this current situation, unfortunately, it ain’t about what they said it was about and I think a lot of Americans are pissed about it. The biggest problem is now we’re passed two thousand young lives over there, and are going to be even more than that before this is all over. Because there is a war that’s going on, that’s not going to be won the way they are fighting it. You cannot win that war. The best thing that was said when 9/11 happened was, is we can go up and kick their ass, we can go up and do this and that, but unless they address the hearts of the 19 men that made themselves a bomb, unless they address that, the war that they are fighting right now will go on just like the same war that is going on between Palestine and Israel. The different wars that are going around the planet, they are never going to stop it because you are not fighting the war. The real war [points at his heart], as I’m saying, “OK, now we come back with some changes. America has to make some changes because the politics that they had been making for the past 20, 30 years helped only fucking people up.” And Americans don’t know it but when you look at 9/11, it’s kind of an indication, but still there is a lot of Americans that don’t realize how much America is a part of different demises around this globe. And the demises, unfortunately, aren’t to anybody else’s advantage but America and what’s really cold about the American structure or the politics is, they are smart enough to do it this way. They are not actually doing it: Oh, that is not ours! Been doing that for 30 years or more. However, truth being told, these wars that were going on, these wars will continue on until they start lessening their so-called pursuit of grip of power because that’s what it is, guys. It is not pursuing to give nobody’s shit! [laughs] Excuse me, it’s a pursuit of power and they call it a lot of other things and I think me and a lot of other people are sick of it and [whispers] that’s the magic. It’s that me and you, it’s us that makes those guys powerful. [laughs] ‘Cause at the end of the day, it’s us that make those guys powerful. When the people across the continent, across the world realize that this together will be a start in us realizing some of the magic that we have here. But I wish you all love, I love you dearly and I’m sure, I hope it comes back. But mine is, it’s like I said to Anya, like I would say to anybody of these questions, I’m 24, 26 hours a day nasty, and 27 hours a day very much in love. I just hope they give me about another 20 years because I really feel like I can do something to something that I haven’t done before. [laughs, audience joins in, clapping]
In fact I can only allude to my usual point of view that it was so sensual, it was impossible not to like this album. I don’t want to elaborate on that point because I don’t have to. I’ve had other people elaborate for me. But play something else. “Body Heat.” In the course of events from Marvin to Quincy [Jones], yeah Quincy and I... [camera cuts again] Mariah Carey. [laughter] You like that?

Ewan Pearson
UK-born, Berlin-based Ewan Pearson has been turbo-boosting dancefloors since 1996. In that time he wrote a book and released a gaggle of challenging tracks. Pearson’s productions surprise even the most jaded ears. Like the man, they’re offbeat, but on point, with a charmingly unpretentious disposition. He’s also put his addictive techno-pop touch to remixes for Pet Shop Boys, Goldfrapp, Erlend Øye, and Depeche Mode, and even produced albums for Tracey Thorn and The Rapture. In this lecture at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy, the techno-pop professor tells us how he makes the catchiest of dancefloor hits.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt We welcome a young man here, Ewan Pearson, so this is our chance to give him some backing. [applause] Ewan Pearson I like the “young man.” Torsten Schmidt Oh, well, it’s all about the flattery, man. Ewan Pearson [laughs] I like it better than “old fart” or “veteran.” Torsten Schmidt Veteran, what sorts? Where have you been, Flanders ‘14/’18 or...? Ewan Pearson I’m 33 now, and I thought about it the other day, I have been doing this on and off for ten years now. Just a slightly scary thought. Torsten Schmidt Oh, but then you are still kind of a late bloomer if you started with 23, kind of. Have you been involved in musical affairs before that? Ewan Pearson I did the usual thing, like bands and things when I was a kid, and I’m quite lucky that I come from a family where music was a massive part of family life. My dad has played guitar in bands as a hobby since he was a kid. So I grew up with lots of folk music and my dad playing in guitar bands, pop/rock bands. I actually played the keyboards in a band of his when I was a teenager, so did the whole like going-around-in-a-van thing. Then I had a band when I was in school, but we were kind of synth-pop duo, and I was the singer because I was the least bad. We were quite terrible actually but... Torsten Schmidt When about was that? Ewan Pearson That was when I was at high school. Torsten Schmidt OK. Where on God’s earth is Kidderminster? Ewan Pearson Kidderminster is in the West Midlands of England. It’s about half an hour from Birmingham. Torsten Schmidt How many times did you play in a club that’s empty? Ewan Pearson Actually, I’m trying to think when was the last time when I played in a club that was empty. I played in a club, one of my favourite clubs in Germany called the Robert Johnson, which is in Frankfurt and it’s one of the best small clubs in Europe. Unfortunately, that night Ricardo Villalobos was playing at the enourmous club Cocoon and it was snowing and there were about 40 people there. And I was kind of disappointed about it. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, but depending where you put the bar in that one, it could still be a good night. Ewan Pearson No, but it’s better to have nobody there than to have lots of people there not dancing, all scowling at you. Torsten Schmidt What was the last time that happened? Ewan Pearson It hasn’t happened in a while. I am trying to block those kind of nights out. Torsten Schmidt How do you identify them when you get requests for booking? Ewan Pearson How do I identify? Torsten Schmidt I mean, when you say you are blocking them out, you must have found some sort of way to block them out. Ewan Pearson Oh no, I mean you rely on your agent, you rely on playing in places that you know. After a while you build up a kind of connection with certain promoters and certain venues. Unfortunately, I’m not DJing as much as I could do at the moment just because I’m trying to do more production again. I was DJing a lot last year and it’s time to push the balance back. Torsten Schmidt So, it’s probably an interesting thing for most in here, the whole agent thing. I mean, how do you find an agent and how do you develop a relationship? I mean, you have got to develop some sort of trust there, right? Ewan Pearson Yeah, it’s an odd thing. I mean, basically I’m a producer that happens to DJ, I’m not a DJ. I did it the wrong way around, I made records for the last ten years. Torsten Schmidt Who says it’s the wrong way around to start with? Ewan Pearson Well, it was always kind of traditionally the other way around, you know, that DJs would then become producers. These days it tends to be the other way around, so it is really hard for people to break in as DJs exclusively. You know, most of the DJs in my field certainly have been producers first. And it’s certainly a way of getting your head above the parapet. Where as only a few people come through the ranks from being residents and DJing like that. I was just doing a club with a friend of mine in London for awhile. I used to play live, I used to do my music live with an MPC set-up, a little filter and a little effects box. And this was before everybody was using laptops, before things like Ableton. It would have been much more exciting to do the live thing with a program like Ableton. Torsten Schmidt I guess it goes for a lot of people that you don’t actually set out and got your Excel sheet ready to go, but nevertheless you do reach a certain stage when you are feeling that you can’t handle it anymore on your own. And then all these, “Do I need a manager? Do I need an agent? What do these people actually do for me? What do I do for them? Are they just ripping me off and...?” Ewan Pearson Yeah, when it comes to taking on other people to work with you, when you get to the point to take things further, I can only speak for myself here and I’m very much of the opinion that I like to work with people that I like and had a genuine relationship with. I mean, my DJ agent is somebody that I have known for six or seven years and she was a really good friend of mine before she started repping me as a DJ. And the guy that manages me now was somebody I met actually, he was a lawyer, he was an entertainment lawyer, and he did the first ever record contract I had to sign. And I got along well with him and just kept in contact with him and then he moved back from the law firm into management. I’m a bit of a control freak, it was interesting listening to Ahmir Thompson yesterday talking sort of being the neurotic anal-potentive one, and I’m like that. I want to be in control of everything I do and so for me, I have to have a really good relationship with people like that before I’m prepared to work with them. I mean, I could’ve joined kind of big management people, but at the moment it seems better to work with people who are kind of tight and close. Also, I think I need help with business side of things. And it’s always good to have somebody saying no on your behalf. That’s kind of basically where you end up paying the manager to kind of block things, basically, but from the creative point of view I kind of make most of the decisions myself. Torsten Schmidt So that way you can always keep up your air of being the [inaudible] guy and somebody else can be like, “Oh no, if I’m not...”? Ewan Pearson Well, it helps. Yeah, my manager is in many ways kind of a professional asshole on your behalf. My manager is an asshole so I don’t have to be, so I can pretend to be really nice. [laughs] I can be an asshole in secret. Torsten Schmidt So obviously, you chose him because you know he is not an asshole and nevertheless something goes wrong and if you now have a personal relationship with that guy, or that woman in that case, how do you go on about that? Obviously, some e-mail did not get sent, some call wasn’t returned, or whatever, some mess-up, and then you dare and then you’re maybe talking to your best friend. Ewan Pearson Yeah, you have to be really tight and you have to be up to say when he says when he thinks I’m being foolish or I’m making mistakes. And I moan at him likewise and you have to be able to say these things and then put it to one side and get on. Torsten Schmidt When you were in this hand-to-mouth kind of phase and you were struggling for remixes and stuff, how did you go about it? Were you the annoying one going like, “Hello, I am Ewan, and I can do the best remixes ever”? Ewan Pearson No, again that’s another reason why it’s good to have people representing you. I’m really bad at self-promotion. You meet different people, you meet the people who are sort of hustlers by nature, and I’ve been always the sort of quietly getting on with it. I mean, basically at the shape of my career has been I started after college off making a couple of independent dance records in the UK for fun, because that was the only thing I ever really wanted to do was just to get a bit of something I do onto vinyl. And then I got an album contract by Soma Recordings in Glasgow, one of the first good independent labels in [England]. Torsten Schmidt Which were already slightly established at that stage. Ewan Pearson Yeah, I think my first single with them was Soma #22. So yeah, and they are up to the sort of #180 or something, #190. Torsten Schmidt That was already past Daft Punk mixes and stuff. Ewan Pearson It was around the same time with Daft Punk and Slam and Funk D’Void and those people. Torsten Schmidt So you were just by association with that label in a position? Ewan Pearson Yeah, that’s right. I mean, they were a label I had been a big fan of since they started, I had all their records. And it wasn’t hustling but I just went up to Glasgow, I was going just to a party, actually. A friend of mine from college, and I just went into a record shop with a demo, kind of classic stuff, and then they said, “Have you been in touch with Soma?” Yeah, and I just rang it up and said, “I’ve got this demo, can I bring it around?”, and I brought it into the office and dropped it off and got a call a couple of weeks later saying they really wanted to put it out. So that was as much hustling as I ever did. And then gradually, I did an album with them and some singles and got off little label remixes. But it was just all trickling slowly, slowly until two or three years ago when the remixes for some reason seemed to [come in]. I don’t know, I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, I think. There was a...certain kind of more electronic, electro – whatever you want to call it – influenced sound came in, and a remix that I did as a favor for somebody turned into quite a big record in 2002 and ended up being voted “Best Remix Of The Year” at the German Dance Awards, it was strange. I never won anything before in my life. And I haven’t since. Torsten Schmidt Thinking back to that Soma stage and you are there, you are a fan of the label, you’ve got something in it like, “Oh, wow, I want to be part of that kind of thing, and uh, that you like what I do.” Now, there comes this lawyer guy and you are like, “Oh, what is all this nonsense?” And to most people a contract is a pretty scary thing. How did you go about that then? Ewan Pearson I don’t know. It helps to have a manager who is also a lawyer as I did, but also after a while – I am great believer in self-sufficiency, I kind of think that you ought to, if you are a recording artist or a remixer and you are getting contracts all the time, then it takes a while, but after a couple of years you begin to learn how to read them. You can’t do everything yourself, but it helps to be as informed as possible. And it’s a good idea to read these things and not just to hand them on to somebody else. It’s a good idea to take a bit of responsibility for yourself. So you have to rely on other people when you are starting and you have to take people’s advice. But my approach was, it was a modest two album deal, two albums, eight singles. It’s for a little independent label, there is no great space for con... Torsten Schmidt Advances? Ewan Pearson Yeah, their advance was pretty small. So, you know, there is no enormous room for arguments. It was fairly standard. The one thing we get about is publishing, and I would strongly advice anybody who is signing a deal with an independent with stuff that they are writing themselves, don’t sign the publishing to them. Just don’t across the board. Lots of people will expect you to as part of it. Don’t do it, don’t ever do it. Because the agencies that are responsible for collecting publishing like PRS and MCPS in Europe and the equivalent ones in America do a fine job of collecting the basics. And basically once you have something, once you have a body of work that is worth something, you can get a publishing deal. And you can get your own publishing deal with a publisher whose job will be to then maximize the collection revenue for you. Torsten Schmidt There’s a lot of complicated and big-sounding words in there. What is it in a nutshell that the publisher does in the first place? Ewan Pearson There’s two types of publishing. There is copyright and music in two places, that’s in mechanical and broadcast. So basically, for every single copy of a record of yours that gets made, the record company has to pay a mechanical royalty. Basically, they are paying for the right to reproduce the actual sound recording you have made. And that comes to you, eventually. And then there is broadcast royalties, radio play, TV licensing, and so forth. Torsten Schmidt Speaking of remixes, [if] I want you to remix my track, or probably the other way around because it might be more interesting for me, what can I expect as an upcoming artist to get out of it apart from exposure? Ewan Pearson To get out a remix? I think you can look at it from a commercial point of view, or you can look at it from an artistic point of view. I think it’s a valid art form, certainly, in its own right and the idea of versioning and making new and cross-pollination and getting new people’s interpretations of your material. Or you can look at it from a hard-headed business point of view and say that it’s about putting a piece of music in a new context and then getting it more exposure and more publicity through making into a club hit, from changing it from one form, from a hip-hop or rock track to a house track or whatever. I mean, you can look at it from a hard-nosed business point of view or you can look at it from the artistic point of view. Torsten Schmidt Let’s do both then. Ewan Pearson OK. Torsten Schmidt I mean, obviously especially in places where there is a heavy concentration of music in the street like London, you got micro-genre X,Y,Z comes around and whatever major will make sure that whatever major artist they have at the time will have to do a remix by the hot kid on this and that pirate station and so on. Can you explain that mechanism a little bit? Ewan Pearson I mean, that element of remixing is just buying some cool, basically. It’s buying some cachet from somebody else’s. It’s using whoever is the hot person at the moment to make your major label artist look or sound cooler than they are...which sounds very cynical [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt It sounds very cynical, but on the other hand some people got cars out of it and other people got their labels and infrastructures and stuff. Ewan Pearson But then, if you are careful about it, I do a lot of remixes for major labels, but I try to be really, really careful about the things that I do. I try to pick things that are going to produce a result with some merit. I am doing this to make a living, but at the same time I’m not just doing this for the money. Torsten Schmidt Can you remember when you first realized, probably as a kid, that a song is not necessarily finished by the time it’s on the record, but that there might be other versions or remixes or whatnot? Ewan Pearson Yeah, I think when I first started realizing it, one of the labels I really liked when I was young was Trevor Horn’s label ZTT. They put out Frankie Goes To Hollywood and The Art Of Noise and there was this amazing German group called Propaganda that I really love. They just used to churn out mixes, they used to put out 12” after 12” after 12”. And at the time in the UK, if you put a new 12” out every week of an existing single, and people kept on buying those 12”s, then you could keep the record in the charts because there was no restriction of the amount of formats which contributed to this chart placing. So they just put more and more new 12” versions out. But I loved the music and I used to buy these different versions, and again, this is somewhere where art and commerce kind of [collide], they are up to doing it for cynical commercial reasons but at the same time you can get some amazing creative results. Torsten Schmidt But, if I get my maths right and you are 33, by the time Dr. Mabuse came out and that kind of stuff, you were not legit to go into the club while a lot of the music was specifically designed for particular club environments. Ewan Pearson Yeah, the first dance music that I really loved was basically like Hi-NRG and Italo disco. And I didn’t realize when I was a naive young man. Basically, my first love was kind of really gay electronic disco, which I still love to this day. And I had no idea about the contexts, I just heard these records. I heard the records that made it across to the charts in the UK – the ones that crossed over. Obviously, I wasn’t hearing them in a club context, I was hearing them first and foremost as pop records. And then it was later when I got older and started going to the clubs myself that I started to understand dance music in its actual context. Torsten Schmidt What did you like about Trevor Horn’s aesthetic approaches? Ewan Pearson For me, Trevor Horn, I think I liked the scale of it. You know, this was the time in the mid-’80s when people were...Technology has sped on to such a degree now, but then samplers were incredibly expensive and you got like a Fairlight musical computer that cost the best part of a million, and this laptop will do [points at his laptop] 20, 40 times what these things could do. You would have these people, you should have an operator for that, and there is another one of the machines called Synclavier, which was similar. You would have all these people, and basically, only really, really successful producers obviously could afford this stuff. But you would have this concentration of this kind of cutting edge technology and these really talented musicians who could operate them. And I liked the fact that Trevor Horn is just epic stuff. And aesthetically I still love the maximal, you know? It’s hard to call it dance music at the moment is going through this kind of love affair with all things minimal. I don’t know, I like some stuff sometimes which is a little bit bigger-sounding, a little bit more in some ways bombastic or epic in some way. I just had my love of Trevor Horn tested somewhat because I did some work on a track for the Pet Shop Boys’ new album this summer, and then he basically got the job of producing the whole record, so I just lost a job to him. But he is one of my all-time heroes, so I can’t complain. Torsten Schmidt So it was alright. Ewan Pearson Yeah. Torsten Schmidt But nevertheless when you say “maximization” and “bombastic sounds,” when you take it back to the second time where house music was around and take a track like Adamski’s “Killer” remix, you got whatever kind of noodely thing in the beginning with some sweeps and then the 909 kicks in, and just the sheer impact of that bass drum is just sending everyone into a frenzy. Ewan Pearson Yes. Torsten Schmidt Now, with the way you would use a bass drum in your mix, it’s slightly different, right? Ewan Pearson Yeah, I mean there was a rawness, especially about Chicago house and acid, and there is an energy and an excitement behind that rawness, which was incredible, which is electric. Some of those records stand up today but things move on, and I think just production standards are much higher, and the technology available to people again at this level is so much further. I don’t know, production values are much higher these days. Then you got this excitement you got from the rawness and the energy and the freshness, this was something new. And it was stripped down, it was previously unheard. Torsten Schmidt I find it kind of interesting that whereas especially in 4/4-based techno kind of stuff for a lot of times it was about the pure sonic sensation the shock factor, the crassness, the harshness of the sound, and if you take just that sheer energy, to some degree a lot of that’s trying to maximize the impact on one particular sound happens on Top 40 Radio these days with The Neptunes, Timbalands, Scott Storches and all that kind of stuff. Ewan Pearson Yeah. Torsten Schmidt And then when you go and see let’s say, hear your music in the club or the Mathew Jonson or whatever, it starts to somehow fade away or suddenly it’s a different sonic tactic working there. Ewan Pearson Yeah, I guess, I kind of want to have my cake and eat it in the sense that I like to stuff as much in there [laughs] as possible without detracting from the fact that you got to be insistent, and it’s got to move the crowd. I want to have the song in there, I want to have development, I want to have chord structures. And sometimes you do overcook it, and you do put too many things in, when sometimes it’s better to keep things simple or keep things more stripped down. But yeah, I suppose it’s an aesthetic. The thing you do first and foremost is please yourself and then you got to square that with pleasing other people as well. Torsten Schmidt Probably, to take it out of that theoretic realm, would you have an example of something where you had the feeling you were pleasing yourself and people were still liking it? Ewan Pearson Let’s see what I’ve got. An example of this notion of doing a remix as an extended mix and not throwing out the baby with the bath water, I did a remix for Depeche Mode last year when they did their remixes project, that big remix album, and I did a remix for “Enjoy The Silence”. Torsten Schmidt What was your favourite Depeche Mode remix before that? Ewan Pearson Remix? I really liked the Francois Kevorkian stuff. I mean, he did lots of this, he did a remix of “Policy Of Truth,” which I used to play when I was younger. Torsten Schmidt I was totally disappointed by that one. Ewan Pearson I mean, they do have an amazing history of remixes, and there’s a really good Adrian Sherwood mix of Master And Servant as well. Torsten Schmidt The On-USound dancehall classic thing? Ewan Pearson Yeah. But basically, when I got back the job I was thinking how can I do a remix, because “Enjoy The Silence” was one of my favourite records of all time. And I always said that I would never do it. I said that if somebody offered me like a real classic record like that to remix that I wouldn’t touch it. I remember DJ Hell did a remix of “West End Girls” for Pet Shop Boys, and I remember writing a slightly rude DJ reaction-sheet to it, saying: “You shouldn’t mess with the classics.” That sort of thing. And then, of course, as soon as I get Depeche Mode on the phone, like 20 seconds later I am like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” panting like a dog. And when I got to do the mix, I tried to do a remix which would sound like an extended mix, it could have been almost made at the time but would still work in a contemporary club context. Torsten Schmidt Even when you say you wanted that 1989 feel, it definitely is not a 1989 303 use. It’s like you put it behind a digital chastity belt more or less, and I think the Trevor Horn bit probably explains it, it’s somehow put into a different realm. Ewan Pearson Yeah, I suppose it... I don’t know, one of the great things things about 303, it’s an absolute bastard to program. I don’t know if any of you have ever used a 303. One of the weird, weird things about it, one of the interesting things, the connections between technology and the aesthetics it ends up producing is that this machine was a failure. This was designed as an accompaniment for guitarists and musicians who wanted to make a sort of self-accompanying thing with this little other drum machine called the Drumatix. Basically, it is incredibly difficult to program, and if you want to program it, in order to program a bassline into it, you need to program it three times. You have to program the pitches in first, and you have to program the rhythm in second, and then you program the succession of accents and slurs in, and you did all of this with a little keyboard with these little silver keys in this box. So you had to program it three times, so nobody did. [laughs] Nobody could be bothered to learn how to use it. So it just became this kind of weird failure, until guys like Marshall Jefferson, people like that in Chicago started using it and they started programming it at random. So they just be kind of putting patterns into it and putting pitches into it. And so one of the reasons why acid house, when it started, was just such a weird, avant-garde-sounding music because it was basically really inharmonic, you know? It was just like 12-note-series or something, it was just weird. And it was basically because of this machine, it was because of people messing around with the machine, which is so hard to program produced this kind of crazy randomness and then, you know, getting on with filters and stuff. And so the aesthetic and this whole strange new dance form was born, basically out of the fact that somebody made this machine in many ways so badly [chuckles] that it was impossible to get it to do what it was originally supposed to do. Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless, the second you make the decision to use that machine, you are entering this whole world of references. It’s like being a guitar band and trying to replay Gang Of Four, which one or two bands do at the moment. Ewan Pearson A few people do that at the moment. Torsten Schmidt I mean, if you use a certain riff, you are definitely putting yourself into that block like, “OK, there has been all this music that has been created with that particular sound, that particular feel, that shuffle, that rhythm, or whatever.” So, how do you go on and walk that line of creating something which is now, which sounds like 2005 or whatever the time is at that stage, and still keeping up? You could think that almost for the first time in electronic music it’s a heavy time where people have to decide whether they are going to be a Led Zep cover band or not. Ewan Pearson It’s a difficult decision. I mean, you can go for this sort of modernist/avant-gardist approach, where the idea is always that it’s got to be new, that it’s got to be new, it’s got to be new. But at the same time, music has other functions. And one of the things that I like about remixing is one can be a little bit more playful. So you can do it. Like, I can decide to do an acid thing, Depeche Mode remix or something. Because it has this kind of commercial element to it, I suppose, I feel the ability to be out of place slightly and not have to think about that kind of big-A artistic point of view. But at the same time I do my best to make music that I love and that moves me. I think one can be more playful in the remix field. Some people will choose to do one thing and appreciate a kind of narrow way, and some people might choose to be more playful or referential. I mean, all music refers out and refers to other things. It’s very rare that you get the complete shock of the new [style]. Torsten Schmidt Nevertheless, if you take, for example, another current album like the recent Isolée thing, it refers to a lot of similar things but you draw totally different conclusions in the way you go on about sound design, for example. Ewan Pearson Yeah, but that’s one of the great things as well, it’s like how you process your influences. You can give people like ten records, ten samples and then ask them to put it together and they can still express themselves whatever way, do it in a different way, too, and whatever else. Yeah, it’s what you make of your influences and how you manifest them. Torsten Schmidt How do you go about sound design? Ewan Pearson I suppose, I take what I can from wherever, really. I go through stages where I actually have a session where I just make sounds. Like, I sit with a plug-in like Reactor and I make a load of patterns, and I print them off as audio, and so I am making kind of material for future use. Or I’ll do the same thing with sampling beats, noises, mostly random, or I program something. I have a SC-1, like a Minimoog, sort of an analog synth, so I have a session on that for later on. But then I am happy to admit using presets, I do use anything that works in the context, really. Sometimes you need things quickly and need looking through a band of presets. Again, certain people have an aesthetic where they say that they never use samples or they never use presets. They only use sounds that they created themselves or programmed themselves and that’s great. I kind of tend to think it’s the end result that matters, not necessarily the manifesto or the rubric by which you get there. It makes for entertaining reading. Torsten Schmidt When you get the commission to do a remix, how do you match the different aesthetics of the sounds of your sound bank and whatever you got in your studio and the raw material that you are getting? Ewan Pearson I think you have an amazing wealth now with the advent of plug-ins. Within something like Logic, I’ve got an amazing amount of mixing tools. Torsten Schmidt How do you prevent yourself from getting lost in that wealth of possibilities? Ewan Pearson Well, you could be there for weeks. I have been, at times [chuckles]. But yeah, if you are careful about the way you pick your sounds – you’ve got the resources there to marry new stuff and old stuff. I think it’s about the choices you make. I suppose, a lot of the reasons why people like the mixes that I do, is that I’m careful about the sounds that I choose and how to put them together. Hopefully, it doesn’t just sound like some modern plug-in slapped on top of some other. Torsten Schmidt Obviously, lots of things that you have been commissioned to do would be a three-and-a-half minute song and you have to turn that into something which is fit for a totally different environment. Obviously, you have got to totally change the scale and the timeframe of what happens within the track. For something, which should work at Berghain, you need to take it totally out of the original world of the song context and restructure it. Ewan Pearson It’s kind of unfolding, really. In the original there are so many elements packed so tightly and arranged in a miniature [fashion] and you are kind of unfolding. It’s opening up, basically. Obviously, in a club context repetition and boredom, and the tension and development – this is where it is made. It is not about getting everything across in three minutes. It’s about creating tension, teasing, satisfying, and building up and breaking down and so forth. Torsten Schmidt How do you prevent yourself of becoming an Armand van Helden type of conveyer belt remix machine? Ewan Pearson Erm, say no? 2002 was this really good year for me and then it crescended into 2003, and by the autumn of 2003 I was being offered three remixes a day. Torsten Schmidt How does your girlfriend get through on your phone when there are always these people? Ewan Pearson [chuckles] That’s why I have a manager. I was being offered absolutely loads, and to be honest, a lot of it I said no to straight away. A journalist was writing about this and got it wrong and said I have done 80 remixes in a year. No, I’d been offered like 80 or 90 in a year and I have actually done seven. Torsten Schmidt You must have been Madlib if you been like... Ewan Pearson Ahmir was talking about this last night. You get to the stage where you can make a choice. You can either say, “Right, I am going to become a production line, and I am going to become Ewan Pearson, the brand.” I could have hired some engineers and set up a couple of studios and use late signature sounds. Torsten Schmidt Def Mix. Ewan Pearson Yeah, I mean, that’s how it has been done. But I want my work to be me and I am not interested in empire building. I am not Sean Combs. I just want to make a living doing stuff that I like. I am happy to be able to be picky and do seven remixes a year, and do seven remixes that I am proud of. And so far, you know, I am making a decent living. I could have really rinsed it in 2003, but I am more interested in having a longer career and staying interested. The danger is, if you are lucky enough to get to that point where you have a successful period like that, you go for it, and you either burn yourself out or get really stale and everybody gets bored. Whereas in 2004, I basically threw away the – not that there was a blueprint – but I made a really, really conscious effort that nothing I did in 2004 sound anything like what I did in 2003. Torsten Schmidt Obviously, Cedrick [Academy participant], I think yesterday talked about Francois K going to New York at the end of the ‘70s, and people who want to move from one country to another. What happens to you psychologically when you start living abroad, you don’t understand the language per se? Ewan Pearson I think for me, it had started a little bit earlier when I started to DJ and travel a lot. And I think a lot of people experience this. You start to feel a bit dislocated when you have moved away. London stopped feeling like such a home for me, to be perfectly honest. There are lots of personal things that changed my life within that two-year period, including splitting up from a long-term girlfriend. So I suppose, if I psychoanalyze, a lot of it was a delayed reaction to that as well, and I wanted to make a positive out of some of the things that happened. I thought I got to the age of 30, and I have no responsibilities, and I have just got to this stage where I have this job where I can do wherever. So I thought I would have an adventure, go somewhere else. Torsten Schmidt When you say “adventure,” most people will have the feeling living in a place like Kidderminster or wherever, you never are going to get anywhere by staying here. And what sometimes happens is they just get on the road and start moving around and they get to Barcelona for two years, and London for two years, and New York for a year and so on. How do you prevent yourself from...? Ewan Pearson I dont know. It’s been only two years into my wandering stage. And I lived a very boring, sedentary life in London for eight years. I don’t know if I will settle or whether I move back to the UK yet. Torsten Schmidt There is a time in many peoples life when they have to decide, “Do I have a plan B, C, D. You have a plan PhD already in your pocket, and you had some sort of an academic career. You published a book, which in the academic world is something like your door-opener. What happened to Professor Pearson? Ewan Pearson Professor Pearson [chuckles], he decided to be a poor musician rather than a poor academic. Torsten Schmidt So you are triple P! Ewan Pearson Yeah. Torsten Schmidt Platinum Pied Piper. Ewan Pearson [laughs] But I don’t know, as I said, I never really had a master plan. My career has been kind of erratic and I basically always thought I would be involved in education. I was going to stay at a college and be a teacher. Music developed its own momentum. So the academic work and the book was actually writing about music. Torsten Schmidt A cheeky way in. Ewan Pearson It was a good way of bringing together two of my interests. At the same time they did not really meet in the sense that the book was published by an academic publishers, Routledge. Torsten Schmidt No one dances to texts. Ewan Pearson No, I did my album for Soma around the same time the book came out, and I did not mention the book at all in interviews. Because in the UK there is certainly an inverted snobbery, you know, there is an anti-intellectual or an anti-analytical prejudice in the UK with regards to pop. Audience Member When you are working in this kind of ambience you have to behave in a certain way. And I think when you are starting, maybe you think you have to behave in a certain way, but you are wrong. I would like to know, which advices did they give you, and what you think is important for us to know? Ewan Pearson I try to think of a good advice I have had...I don’t know, I just say, the best advice that I can give is to be making sure what you are doing, trying to do the best work that you love and working with people that you trust. And if you don’t trust them, then at least people that you respect or that you are clear about what their job is and what your job is. And also, from my point of view, I’m a self-employed musician, I don’t work for anybody else, that’s what I wanted. And it’s sometimes hard to be doing it on your own, but it’s a great job to be able to be making music for a living and not to be working for somebody else. So it is worth persevering, it’s worth sticking through when you haven’t got any money and your friends are doing jobs. I went to college with these people and the next five or six years they were lawyers, governors. I remember, my girlfriend was doing a PhD, and I was a self-employed musician. We could afford to get to the cinema and have a pizza once a week. That was it. And the rest of the time we were just in our flat working. You just fall out of society, nobody is seeing you. But you know, if you really want to do it, it is worth persevering with. And in many ways I am glad that I’ve had my success such as it is when I am a bit older. I am 33 and I did not really start to make a proper living from doing this until three years ago. And I think when it would have happened to me when I was 20, 21, when I have first done it, I would probably have turned into a horrific, egotistical so-and-so. [cell phone rings, laughter] Whereas now I am hopefully a little bit more modest about it, and I understand that there is a lot of love involved as well. So, yeah, it’s persevere. Do what you love, and realize that it’s as much about luck as judgment, so try and stick at it. Audience Member When you look at the evolution DJs have made, do you think in the future the status of the DJ will be the same? Or is it more going to be like, we are going to go through [a phase] when the people invite those people who make the music instead of letting the DJ play the records? Ewan Pearson I think you are right. I think to a degree maybe that has already happened in a sense that lots of DJs now, the new DJs coming through tend to be also producers. So in some sense you are getting the people, the DJs who are also producing the music. I think, certainly from a UK perspective, the age of the superstar DJs, that kind of era has ended a little bit that you sort of had in the mid-’90s. Certainly, people don’t get as big fees as they used to and a lot of the clubs just survived with putting certain people on. I mean obviously, all these people are incredibly well established and make a lot of money still. But I think things have been shaken up a bit in the last couple of years. I don’t think it is necessarily healthy for people to be paid incredible, astronomical fees that they were being paid four or five years ago. Certainly, it wasn’t healthy for the club scene. From the UK perspecitve and from Europe, the places I know best, it seems to be a little bit more sensible again. But at the same time people still do command large, ridiculous amounts of money for that. But then they spend a lot of time on the road and away from home and various things. So I am not going to critisize their payments. Torsten Schmidt Well, thank you first of all. [applause]

Title: Jeremy Greenspan

Jeremy Greenspan
Jeremy Greenspan got his start in Hamilton, Ontario, where in 1999 he founded Junior Boys with Johnny Dark, an electronic pop duo that took inspiration from the vastness of their surroundings, house and techno and the small moments of emotion in everyday life. The pair spent years working out of their bedroom studio, collaborating and making demos, but seemingly getting nowhere. It was after Dark had left the band in 2002 that their demo was eventually heard by KIN Records, and the Junior Boys officially debuted in 2003 as Greenspan and Matt Didemus, his engineer. An album followed in 2004, Last Exit, followed by releases on Domino Records, collaborations with Caribou and Fennesz and a shortlist nomination for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. In 2015, the band released its fifth studio album and Greenspan continues a prolific solo career as producer and remixer.
In this lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, the electro balladeer retraced his musical journey from the shores of Lake Ontario to Berlin’s Berghain, via a chance meeting with Kode9 and some early internet hype.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt It’s great that after a full week we finally have some more or less local talent to represent this tiny, tiny country... [with] just a bit of square miles to its name. Please welcome Mr. Jeremy Greenspan [applause]. The reason why he’s here is not only because he’s Canadian. That would be way too simple, there’s another forty mil... you know, how many? Yeah, so there must be other reasons. I guess it’s pretty fair to say that especially in remix format, there was not an entire... not a single packed dance floor in the last 12 months where your voice has not appeared. [inaudible], but he did original music as well before someone started to remix it. That is not the interesting fact in itself either, but I guess through your stories that you’re going to share and maybe some hands-on things with the lovely little piece of engineering over there, or pieces, rather. A lot in your stories will actually speak, ideally to a lot of people, because it’s not... I mean, Hamilton, Ontario is not exactly London’s West End. Jeremy Greenspan That’s right, yeah. [picking up microphone] I should probably use this thing, yeah [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, that would be a helpful thing. You can really tell that he’s got stage experience. The name Junior Boys might be a bit of confusing to some, because just being a couple of sayings. We’ve got a lot of, “Ooh, ooh, ooh” here. I mean, it’s been the label that’s been hinting at that. I mean, it’s the Junior Boys and all that kind of thing. Are you doing LAD’s music? Jeremy Greenspan No. You know, I didn’t even think about that label until after we had released something and someone had mentioned it to me. I said, “Oh, yeah. That was kind of dumb.” [chuckles], but by then, the name had already kind of stuck. I’m hoping that we don’t get sued by Underworld or whoever runs that label, I can’t remember. Torsten Schmidt Terry Farley? Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, yeah [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt When you finally released something, it’s probably interesting to know that you guys did not just appear out of thin air last year or the year before that. You’ve been, I mean, the name or the project itself existed for quite a bit before that, right? Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, I think the first stuff that we ever did would have been a couple years ago now, I guess. Yeah, I suppose almost five or six years ago. First thing we ever released as Junior Boys was in 2003. Torsten Schmidt You actually started doing stuff in the old millennium, right? Jeremy Greenspan Oh, yeah, certainly, but nothing that would have been particularly interesting to anybody. You know, like lots of people I’ve making music and stuff since I was a kid. When we did the Junior Boys thing, it was kind of a deliberate, sort of idea as to… we wanted to do something very specific, I think. I suppose probably around 2000 is probably when we would have started our first couple of tracks, none of which were ever released. Even by the time we had released our first album, some of those songs on the first album were kind of our first album was kind of a collection of songs that we had written over the past year or two beforehand, so some of them are pretty old, yeah. Torsten Schmidt So luckily, we yesterday passed the lovely town of Hamilton twice on our way to the Niagara Falls. Jeremy Greenspan That must have been great for you guys. Torsten Schmidt It really was a shattering experience, but I guess there’s a little bit more to the town than those plants that you see that dominate the skyline, is there? Jeremy Greenspan No, that’s about it [laughs]. Musically speaking, Hamilton is a, I suppose it’s not particularly interesting. There’s been a couple of bands who have come out recently. One of whose shirts I’m wearing right now, Caribou. He used to be called Manitoba, now he’s called Caribou and he’s from Hamilton as well. Torsten Schmidt He’s just done one of the more interesting albums of this year. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, pick up that album. There’s a guy, I don’t know if you guys know there’s a label called Stones Throw and there’s a guy named Koushik who’s also from Hamilton, and he’s on that label. He’s about to be releasing his first album pretty soon, but he’s had a couple of EPs and did stuff with Percee P and stuff like that. Anyway, we all kind of grew up together and all friends. So kind of representing our hometown to some extent. Torsten Schmidt If I put my journalist hat on for a second, I’d be going like, “Hang on, Caribou, Koushik, Junior Boys.” There seems to be like a certain shared love for melody and classic pop and just empathy and pathos to a degree. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, I mean, it’s a fairly depressing city, I suppose. It’s got that sort of a Canadian version of Pittsburgh or something like that or maybe in England Sheffield or one these kind of very industrial sort of cities. Unusual, strange kind of people. I think what made... what makes it interesting for me and why I choose to still live there is the fact that there’s no particular pressure in the city to be a part of a particular scene or particular genre. When I first started making music, electronic music, dance music and stuff like that, the notion was that you’re going to try and make some music that kind of apes something that’s going on somewhere in a much more exciting place. You’re going to... Torsten Schmidt You mean like London 25 years ago? Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, basically you sit there and try and make, I don’t know, make drum & bass records or you’re going to make Detroit techno records or something like that. It just doesn’t make any sense. You’re in this city where you have no context or contact to what’s going on in London or something like that, and try and make this music that’s kind of their music. In general, those kind of scenes tend to be extremely insular. They have their own crew of guys that make that kind of music. Generally speaking, outsiders don’t usually become involved all that much. I remember at the time, there was kind of a crew, in Toronto, there would be these sort of Toronto drum & bass producers or Toronto Detroit techno producers and the whole thing always seemed kind of pathetic to me [laughs]. These kind of people doing something that really wasn’t their own, it was someone else’s. I think what was good about being in a city like Hamilton is that there was no pressure for me to try and fit in to any kind of particular sound. I sort of feel as though we were able to make the kind of music where it doesn’t categorically fit anywhere in particular, which is, I think a positive thing. Torsten Schmidt I mean, it’s a definitely a different thing compared to, as we learned earlier, making music with people or for people, by their [inaudible] same kind of place. Definitely, there’s a bit of an influence, which is kind of obvious there as well. It’s just that those people are rather... Jeremy Greenspan We definitely wear our influences on our sleeve, definitely. We sort of... there’s certain types of music that we grew up with. From record to record, actually, from our first record we had a sort particular sound and a very particular set of influences that we were interested in at the time. Then, when we did our second record, which is – we only have two records – our second record, we were sort of listening to different stuff, different material. I think that the record sounds different because of it, but hopefully, you just sort of become confident thinking, “Well, if I make it, it’s going to be me, it’s going to be us, it’s going to sound like us.” You don’t have to worry too much about whether or not you sound like yourself or not, because I was initially worried, thinking, “Gee, this second record doesn’t sound like the first record. I hope that the people who like the first record also like this one.” That would be a little bit stressful, but you sort of choose to ignore it after a while. Torsten Schmidt Should we maybe get a bit of an example of how that evolution went, so that it’s slightly less abstract for people who did not follow? Jeremy Greenspan Oh, I would, but I don’t even have any of my own music here [laughs]. Torsten Schmidt We might just have to get back to the humming state of things. Jeremy Greenspan Oh, sure. Torsten Schmidt You played earlier on, while we were at lunch, a couple of influences that, yeah, as you said, you’re wearing on your sleeve. Can you probably just give us a medley there and run through it? Jeremy Greenspan Sure. Let’s see. Well, when we first started making music, as Junior Boys... Torsten Schmidt Probably hang on for a second. You always talk about “we” and the lineup has changed slightly over the years. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, that’s right. When I started the band, it was myself and a friend of mine named John. Then, it was sort of a long story, how we got signed and all that kind of stuff, but... Torsten Schmidt I guess there’s something interesting in that story, because it wasn’t like you went up to your local record store and there was the guy who signed it. Jeremy Greenspan OK, yeah. Well, I could tell that story if you want [chuckles]. Torsten Schmidt I mean, that’s a situation where quite a few people will find themselves into. Jeremy Greenspan Sure, OK. Well, basically, I started the group with a friend of mine named John. I was at university at the time. We just made music as most people do, just for fun. With no real ambition to do it professionally or anything like that. Anyway, I have a friend who, at the time... Actually, you just had, the last speaker was on Tempa Records, right? Right, so my friend is a guy named Steve Goodman who runs a label called, which you might know, I don’t know. He goes by the name Kode9. Anyway, he used to run a website called hyperdub.com. I don’t even know if hyperdub.com even exists anymore. Anyway, it did for a time, and he would sort of run articles. I used to live in England when I was 17, and we lived together, so I met him when I was pretty young. Anyway, I had made this music, this stuff onto Junior Boys with my friend John. He asked if I would send him, I think, three songs, one of which called “Birthday” ended up on our first album and was actually the first song that we ever released. Anyway, we put it up on this website, and he put a little interview with me and so forth. What happened was a couple of journalists, British journalists mainly, started writing on their own blogs online. I think this was at a time when blogs were quite new. They started writing about our songs online and posting links to it and stuff like that. Unbeknownst to us, it started generating a little bit of very kind of minor press through these Internet sites, enough so that I started getting requests from journalists. I’d get these weird emails that would be like, “Hello, I write for such and such magazine. We’ve heard about you and we want a CD,” thinking that we had released something. I’d send them these CD-Rs with my little hand drawing or something like that and say, “Hey, go nuts.” It started getting reviews, which was the weirdest thing. Like, who gets a review for a CD-R that they send off in the mail? Eventually, I got an email from a guy named Nick Kilroy who was a completely manic guy who sort of said, “Listen, I work for Warp Records” – [to audience] you guys probably know Warp Records – “We’re going to do a whole bunch of 12 inches of unknown groups and we want you guys to be one of them.” I said, “Sure. That sounds great.” At this point, I had absolutely no thought that I was going to be doing music. I was applying to schools and all that kind of stuff. Anyway... Eventually, he started emailing me all the time, this guy Nick. Eventually, it came out that he said, “Well, listen. Warp isn’t going to do this, after all.” To this day, I kind of have the feeling that he made the whole thing up to begin with. Torsten Schmidt Why would people on the Internet ever do such a thing? Jeremy Greenspan He did definitely work for Warp, but I don’t know if he was ever really an A&R guy or... Torsten Schmidt Someone needs to take out the trash. Jeremy Greenspan Exactly. Anyway, he eventually quit his job at Warp Records in order to start his own record label, which he did. He started this record label, which he called KIN. The first thing that he released on it was an EP of ours, which was this song, “Birthday,” and a couple other songs. At that point, my friend, John, had gotten a very high-powered job in the video game industry where he still is. He laughed. At that point, I didn’t have any expectation to do anything else, but then Nick came to me and said, “Listen. Do you think you could do a whole album?” I said, “OK. I’ll give it a shot.” I, then, recorded the rest of what became our first album. At that point, I asked my friend, who I had done music with basically my whole life since I was a kid, his name is Matt Didemus, to help me finish this record. Since then, Matt became the other part of the band. We finished an album. It was called Last Exit and we released that through KIN, initially, in Europe. Very limited release. It was through that release that that album got picked up by a much bigger record label, Domino Records, who is our record label now. They initially were just a label that just licensed us through Nick. But then, Nick sadly passed away and then eventually we turned over to Domino Records. That’s how we ended up on that. Torsten Schmidt Can you probably explain a little bit more what’s the difference as an artist to be on a label and then be licensed for another label? That sounds a bit like human trafficking. Jeremy Greenspan [laughs] Basically, it’s just a music business thing. Sometimes people like to own all their material and then have the option to license their... Think about it like lending your music, so to speak, for a limited time to various record labels who operate in certain territories. For example, you might be a German musician, and you own all of your rights to your music, and you say, “I want this music to be released in Canada.” You find a Canadian record label, and you say, “I’m going to license this album to you, if you’d like it, for a certain fee. You have the right to release it exclusively or maybe not exclusively in your country for a limited amount of time.” It’s very attractive for, I would say, most people, but for people like me who don’t relish the idea of being involved in the music industry, so to speak, having to deal with those kinds of decisions all the time, because that’s what that requires, often a better option is to sign with a record label for the world. In those kinds of situations, you want to find a record label that you really, really like or who really, really likes you and that are filled with really nice people, and people that are excited about you and sign your life away. That’s what I did. Torsten Schmidt This whole territorial thing. To which degree does it make sense with a lot of the business swapping over to the internet as the main carrier? Jeremy Greenspan I suppose it depends on... Even on the internet, from what I understand, most internet sales happen through iTunes and iTunes still exists on a territorial basis. There’s iTunes Canada, iTunes U.S., and all of that licensing all works on that territorial basis. Actually, we’ve been very fortunate that we have a very large proportion of our record sales actually happen through iTunes. They’ve been very kind to us. Yeah, you have to license your stuff to iTunes on the basis of what country. I don’t think they even have a relationship... I’m sure they have relationships with each other, but it doesn’t works that if you’re on iTunes Canada, automatically you’re going to be on iTunes U.S. or iTunes Europe. Torsten Schmidt Without turning this into a commercial, when you said earlier you don’t have any of the music with you, can we probably get your computer because it’s set up to the internet, and use it as a means of playing some of the music? Jeremy Greenspan Of my music? Yeah, sure. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, because I think it’s easier if we just take one that’s set up. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah. Torsten Schmidt It’s my dodgy way of seeing how the game’s running, but don’t worry. I’m unplugging this, so there might be a hum. Jeremy Greenspan Who’s winning? Who’s playing anyway? Torsten Schmidt It’s still 0-0. Jeremy Greenspan Is this German league? Is this two cities no one’s ever heard of, like, Freiburg versus Regensburg? Torsten Schmidt It’s even worse. It’s the bottom of the second division, so you don’t want to know. Yanik, if you see this, we’re going to whoop your ass. Because it’s his team against my team, and it’s the 81st minute, and it’s still 0-0. It sounds like an exciting game, eh? Oh, there we go. Jeremy Greenspan I don’t think there’s any music on our website. Our website is terrible. Torsten Schmidt There’s this other thing. What’s it like? The promotional thing? Jeremy Greenspan MySpace. Torsten Schmidt No, no, no, not that one. Jeremy Greenspan Oh. Torsten Schmidt Another promotional thing for the tour where you’re... Jeremy Greenspan At the video competition thing? Torsten Schmidt Yeah, that’s... Jeremy Greenspan Oh, the sothisisgoodbye.com, that thing? Torsten Schmidt Yeah, something like that. Jeremy Greenspan Basically what happens there is that we’re like guinea pigs, so Domino will hire some guy who’s really good at doing stuff on the internet, and they’re like, “Let’s make a Junior Boys website with this guy who can make bubbles that talk,” or something. Torsten Schmidt What’s it called? Because there’s lots of music on there. Jeremy Greenspan Is there? Torsten Schmidt Yeah. There’s also this other thing where there’s, like, two full live concerts as well. Jeremy Greenspan You know it all, better than I do. Oh, Fabchannel. That’s not a good one to use because I forgot all the lyrics of that concert. Torsten Schmidt Well, there’s two concerts. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, both of them are terrible, but... Torsten Schmidt Okay, it’s for concerts that are screened out of Amsterdam, maybe. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, at the Paradiso club, which is a beautiful club. Really, really, really old club. Torsten Schmidt What’s... Jeremy Greenspan sothisisgoodbye.com. Or, you can just go to our MySpace page, I suppose. I probably should have brought my own music instead of setting up all of these Orchestral Maneuver in the Dark tracks that probably nobody wants to listen to. Torsten Schmidt There’s nothing wrong with that. The only thing that I find quite interesting is when you say you were born in ’79, and listening to the thing, and the first thing that really pops up is Tora, Tora, Tora, and Vince Clarke. Did you have an older brother who listened to that kind of stuff? Jeremy Greenspan No, but I kind of got into that stuff through another guy. There was a guy, his name’s Mark Fisher. He runs a website called k-punk, which is a really good website. He taught me all this kind of stuff when I was about 16. I came to new wave and ’80s synth pop music through dance music because most people who make... Most people who I listened to who made dance music were... (music starts playing) There’s a stop button. Just make that go away. Most people who, traditionally, I listened to - Old Detroit and house producers, early house producers stuff like that - are all a generation older than me. Sometimes two generations older than me. Those are all people who would have grown up listening to Giorgio Moroder, or Vince Clarke, or whoever. It was through those kind of people. Sort of like that thing, you know. Hearing Japan samples and Goldie records, stuff like that, that got me interested. Torsten Schmidt So it’s actually the same way as people who would get into soul and funk music through listening to hip-hop. Jeremy Greenspan Exactly, yeah. That’s exactly right. Torsten Schmidt The one thing that at least from afar, for your sense of space and distance, cities like Detroit and Chicago are relatively close to where you grew up. How big was the interchange between those scenes here? Jeremy Greenspan It was really big for me. In Hamilton, there was a close proximity to Detroit. I’m assuming most of you guys probably know who Richie Hawtin is Richie Hawtin, John Acquaviva, and those people owned a record label called Plus 8, which is out of Windsor, Ontario, which is about two hours from Hamilton. There was a Hamilton label called Steel City Records, which was run through Plus 8 and Probe and all of those... Torsten Schmidt Can we get some more laptops in here? (laughs) Jeremy Greenspan All of those networks. Every Friday night at this one club, they would bring in another Detroit techno DJ up. Every Friday night, they would have another Detroit techno DJ guys like, lesser known guys, like Aux 88 and Dee-win, and those kind of people. Then, they would bring out... Derrick May would come or Jeff Mills would come, but often Richie Hawtin would come and play. I remember seeing Richie Hawtin playing. It was one of the first things I ever went to as a kid. I went probably in the early ’90s. I was probably 15 years old and went to see Richie Hawtin play at a little club in Hamilton where they had done everything. They would put plastic all over the walls and everybody was losing their minds on Red Bull. That was how I got indoctrinated into that world, so to speak. Torsten Schmidt Interestingly, because you mentioned Stones Throw earlier the same way as those guys are probably Koushik’s probably not a good example because stylistically, he’s slightly off their radar. In a similar way, as most of these guys are a lot closer to the original roots of funk and soul music, you are actually a lot closer to the roots of those DJs that you liked. You went to the same school as Richie, but there’s a lot more of that influence than let’s say the latest Minus release. Jeremy Greenspan It’s partly that’s just what I’ve immersed myself in more lately. On the last record for example, I listened to almost... The main impetus for the last record was sort of late disco and early house music. I suppose that kind of influence is what would have been the influence for early techno records as well. I just wasn’t making techno music. I was making my own music, but coming from a similar influential place, I suppose. Torsten Schmidt Should we probably unplug this again? I’ve been working as a waiter for long enough to do this. Don’t worry. So, which one to pick? Jeremy Greenspan These are all from my second record. Torsten Schmidt I mean, what do you expect? You turn up here and it looks like now you’re complaining. Jeremy Greenspan I know. Torsten Schmidt There’s even the remixes. Jeremy Greenspan Oh yeah, you even got the remixes. I don’t know. I guess, why don’t you play... Actually, you know what? I’m going to play something first. Torsten Schmidt Okay. Jeremy Greenspan I’m going to play something first and then... Torsten Schmidt Do we need to get some more computers first? Jeremy Greenspan No, no, no. This will be alright. I’m going to play you guys some early house music that influenced a lot of what was happening on our latest record. So maybe it will give you guys sense here. Nice. This is a totally classic house track that you probably all know anyway and I’m not going to play the whole thing because it’s like eight minutes. How does this work when you guys have eight minute songs? Do you just play two minutes of it or something like that? Torsten Schmidt Just give us a sense of it. Jeremy Greenspan OK. Alright. Well, this is Jamie Principle with Frankie Knuckles, “Your Love.” (music: Frankie Knuckles feat. Jamie Principle - “Your Love” / applause) OK, so I’ll just play you two seconds of... Here’s me patently ripping him off. (music: Junior Boys - “Like A Child” / applause) Torsten Schmidt There is also a bit of R&D involved, especially later on when you start singing. Jeremy Greenspan The thing about Jamie Principle and the thing that excites me about early house music and sort of late disco, early ’80s disco, is the way in which the music was sort of in between genres. There was a time at which people were making house music when they were making it for the Warehouse Club in Chicago or making it for The Music Box or making it for the Paradise Garage, or all of those kind of clubs, when there was no sort of rules and there was no sort of set guidelines for what the music was supposed to be. It was called house music because it was the music that was played at the house club and they just thought, I suppose, that they were making disco music. What’s exciting for me about that time is that no sort of genre had actually coalesced so there’s a total feeling of free experimentation. I think that’s the sort of moment that I’d like to try and capture to some extent. I don’t think of us as making retro music. I don’t try and ape, particularly, those kinds of songs verbatim. I think in order to do that I’d probably have to get a whole bunch of vintage equipment and do it and set the conditions up to do it the way they did it and stuff like that. I tend to like to use new stuff and to try and be forward thinking and think about making stuff that’s as contemporary as possible. With the notion that what I take from that moment is the sense of freedom about it and the sense of just kind of total experimentation. Yet, trying to make music that is pop music that’s not alienating, it’s not particularly difficult for a dance floor or for a casual listener to understand. Torsten Schmidt It’s a lot more about the general aesthetics rather than fetishizing about a certain piece of equipment or the actual sound? Jeremy Greenspan Exactly, exactly. I think when we started making music as the Junior Boys that came out five or six years ago, I think at the exact moment when we did our first release is when there were bands coming out, you know these sort of bands from Brooklyn or stuff, who kind of were doing a lot of sort of ’80s aesthetic music. This sort of electro-clash music and stuff like that, which I had an immediate sort of distaste towards because I thought that the whole thing was sort of trying to be ironic and trying to sort of... You know, that kind of ’80s aesthetic of... There’s certain types of ’80s music which I don’t have a particular affinity towards which is that sort of very rigid electro-music where they sort of sing about kind of being in sports cars and smoking cigarettes. That whole ’80s vibe which I had no particular interest in. For me, the music that I liked I thought was actually fairly emotionally sophisticated. Bands like Japan and Ultravox and stuff like that. I didn’t really particularly want to be lumped in with anybody who I thought was sort of making fun of the ’80s. That never interested me. Torsten Schmidt I guess it was kind of hard for you guys because obviously as the listener you’re like, “Oh no, here’s another one of those.” You have to overcome this kind of prejudgment of like, hang on, but there’s something different about these guys that sets them apart from the also ironic asymmetric haircuts. Jeremy Greenspan I think with us we managed to avoid most of that by the fact that, first of all when we came out we had such a sort of R&B influence... It was just the aesthetic of what we were doing was I think too rooted in what was happening. Basically it just was not faithful enough to the ’80s for people to particularly say we were an electro-clash group or something like that as opposed to some of the other bands where they have these sort of ... You know, it’s all 808 drum machines and... Torsten Schmidt You mean you actually liked something that was happening after 1986. Jeremy Greenspan Happened after 1986. Exactly. I think that because of that we managed to never actually be lumped into that. At the same time I’m kind of glad that that stuff seems to have waned in popularity somewhat. Torsten Schmidt Ideally, yeah. It doesn’t really take a doctors degree in psychology to figure out that there’s a great deal of melancholy involved in these kind of things as well. Now, again, from the outside looking in, Canada might strike you as a place where melancholy might hit you now and then. Jeremy Greenspan It has that kind of northern flavor. It’s funny that when we go abroad usually we seem to be most popular in other northern countries. For example, we’ve done really well in Sweden and in Norway and to some extent in Germany. Places where it’s conceivable that people could be quite depressed. Where it gets cold at night and so forth. I’m not particularly a depressive person. I get asked that quite a bit. I like to write songs I think that are somewhat emotionally honest. Most of the time when people write songs, often love songs or something like that, the tendency is to write very overwrought emotions. They’re about immense, enormous pain or overjoy, which to me doesn’t really speak to the reality of what day to day life is. Day to day life I think is usually some sort of assemblage of very small imperceptible emotions often and things that are usually somewhere between being overjoyed and sad. I guess the word melancholy, people use that word as a blanket almost for what actual, I think, day to day life actually is. For me writing the album, I was trying to sort of speak emotionally about things that are part of my daily life which is why so much of the record is about being on highways or being in sort of suburban zones and places like that because that’s where I’m from and that’s my routine so to speak. Those things sort of speak to me emotionally. People forget that people who grow up in places like Canada also have emotional lives too. Their emotional lives are usually dependent on all of the experiences that they have. I think if you live perhaps in a historical city, a city of great significance like New York City or something like that, then you have a lot of emotional attachment to things that for the whole world are iconic. You can sing a song about... Just take any kind of... Just sort of thinking, like any sort of Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen kind of song about being on whatever 42nd Avenue or a song about Broadway or something like, that the whole world can understand and relate to because they’re these iconic things. For the rest of us, we have our emotional lives that are attached to places that are sometimes neither here nor there. They’re the mall that you went to when you were a kid, or the highway that you drive every day, or something like that. To me, I thought making a kind of romantic album about those spaces was kind of more honest. It’s sort of about what I was talking about earlier, about trying to not pretend to be anyone that you’re not in your music. Torsten Schmidt How many people are living in the GTA? Jeremy Greenspan In the GTA, which Hamilton is not part of yet, the GTA would probably be, I would assume, around four million. Probably four or five million. Torsten Schmidt Montreal? Jeremy Greenspan Montreal is maybe a million or two. Torsten Schmidt Vancouver? Jeremy Greenspan Vancouver is probably about a million. I think Calgary has just overtaken... Calgary is the largest growing city in the country. Torsten Schmidt So you got four cities which combine seven million and you got 40 in total and land mass that is what, four or five times the size of Europe? Jeremy Greenspan It’s remarkable. Torsten Greenspan What happens when the rest... Jeremy Greenspan I think there’s a particular thing... I’m going to go out on a limb and assume that most people in the room have not done a massive American road trip at any point in their life, but has anybody ever done that? You have? OK. The experience of driving in America is an interesting one because America is a big country. Not as big in land mass as Canada, but it’s a very large country. Torsten Schmidt Just [inaudible]. Jeremy Greenspan Just so everyone knows we’re bigger. Anyway, the interesting thing about being in America is that you can drive in any direction. You can take any highway you want and you’re going to end up somewhere. You’re going to end up maybe in California and Los Angeles. You’re going to end up in a city or a state or a place that you have some understanding of where it is. You know? With a community there. With a culture there. With a group of people that... You know, any direction you go you will end up somewhere. Canada is completely different. If you drive, for example, if you drive on any other highway aside from the one that goes to Toronto, you will end up in the middle of nowhere. It’s a kind of nowhere that your mind can only begin to understand. I urge any of you... You’re lucky that you’re actually in Canada for arguably the most beautiful time you could possibly be here. I’d be remiss I suppose if... I guess, am I the sole Canadian person? Torsten Schmidt No, there’s going to be more than one. Jeremy Greenspan OK, good. Torsten Schmidt You can fly the flag... Jeremy Greenspan I’ll fly the flag anyway. If you have the chance to go up north at some point and to go to something like Algonquin Park or something, or Temagami. When I was a kid I used to go with my parents to Temagami, which literally you can go to a lake and go camping and there’s not going to be another person for 200 miles or something. You can go to Algonquin Park. Algonquin Park is probably bigger than Germany. It’s nuts and it kind of... I remember a couple of months ago I was flying to Vancouver and you get out of the plane after your 6 hour flight and you instinctively look for your passport. Then you go, “Oh my gosh, I’m in the same country, I totally forgot.” Which I think Americans can understand that sense to some extent. I think Europeans have zero idea as to what that possibly means. Torsten Schmidt For us we’ve only got car wise, apart from Montreal and stuff, we only got 3 hours North so far and even there... Europe you would have passed about 82 different countries. Jeremy Greenspan Exactly. Torsten Schmidt I had to learn I don’t know how many different languages and dialects. And there you just see this road which just has to go through this really tough granite kind of stone where you can really see that it takes them ages and loads and loads of money to dynamite the road through this nature. All the cities are down here. What’s the psyche behind knowing that there is so much of what’s you and your heritage just... Jeremy Greenspan I think your notion of distance is much different. Especially European. I dated a girl who was from England and her grandparents lived in Manchester. Until they were 80 years old they had never been to London in their life. Which I thought was pretty incredible. For those who don’t know that’s maybe a three hour drive or something like that. I don’t know a three or four hour drive. To drive from here to Vancouver would take four or five days or something like that. I think the sense of distance is the central one but I think what for me I love about this country... The thing that interests me should I say, is that when you are here in this part of the country – and don’t forget that this is the most densely populated part of Canada, between here and Woodland, Windsor and the Golden Horseshoe as it’s known – is the fact that you have these cities that are very young cities. They have no real historical rooting in any of the sense that a European city would have or an Asian city would have. They are kind of seemingly carved out of the wilderness. You guys maybe, at some point might be going up CN Tower. I don’t know if the music academy gets quite that touristy but if you do go up the CN Tower, you’ll see the way in which the city is actually how green Toronto is and how it looks like it is carved out of a forest. Where I’m from, Hamilton, is much more so because it’s actually on the Niagara escarpment. All of the cities in the country are like that. You just need to go outside of the city for 10 minutes and look at a forest and realize that this empty space goes on for another 1000 miles or something like that. Gives you a funny perspective. People have commented that I make Canadian records and I sort of embrace that to the extent that I like to make records that have a lot of empty space in them. Torsten Schmidt In case you wondered what all the semi-esoteric hoopla was all about, in the same way as all that bit earlier wasn’t an iTunes commercial, this wasn’t sponsored by the Canadian tourist board. You can actually realize when listening to the music that there’s a lot of longing involved. To use another euphemism or metaphor for the melancholy bit. Longing always got to do something with distance and something that you need to bridge. Be it longing for, in soul music, that love that you lost or that love that you will never get. Even like lots of that ’80s music that you’re citing. It’s always like that distant thing that you’re never going to get through. You’ve got a lot of different aspects involved here, right? Jeremy Greenspan Car travel is a central theme in a lot of my music. Partly because I think it’s an interesting space. I think it’s also the fact that I don’t want to make music specifically for dance floors. I don’t work at that tempo particularly. But I also don’t really want to make down tempo music so I sort of sometimes imagine to myself that I make music for the purposes of being in a car. And also, because as a touring musician so much of your life is spent inside of a car that it becomes a central part of your life. Torsten Schmidt How do you avoid cliches there? It’s the usual thing especially with young, skinny looking English bands. The first record is all about the girl that works at the counter at the local supermarket and the second one is all about fights and booze and groupies on tour. So what’s next? There must be more topics. Jeremy Greenspan Usually by the third or fourth album that’s when you employ a boys’ choir or you make a... Or you get into vaguely esoteric world music. A Peruvian nose flautist or something like that. I’m sure my fourth album will be stinking it up pretty hard. Torsten Schmidt Probably getting back to the second one a little bit, just to give you a bit more of an idea for those of you that haven’t heard it. Probably we’ll just stick with the same song because then you just skipped before the voice was coming in. Jeremy Greenspan Well, you know what why don’t you play this one because I was just talking about car travel so much. Maybe play the one that’s sort of about car travel. Torsten Schmidt OK. Maybe do this first because it’s probably kind of interesting. Jeremy Greenspan Oh, you want to hear this one. Torsten Schmidt ...and when we talk about writing music as well. Jeremy Greenspan Sure. Torsten Schmidt How you go from that obvious kind of headnod to music that you like that uses space in a different sense. Jeremy Greenspan Sure. (music: Junior Boys - “Like a Child”) There are certain songs on the record that are kind of about youthful innocence. “In The Morning,” which was our single from the record, is about that, so to speak. Sort of youthful. There it is. Another kind of Jamie Principle rip off, to be honest. (music: Junior Boys - “In the Morning”) Nostalgia... I got it back. When you say what went wrong with the whole ’80s thing and drawing influences from it. What threw a lot of people off with the whole electric clash thing was this massive backlash of rockers. Everything that was bad about rock just brought back electronically amplified really. Now you have to go and perform this stuff in some sort of a live capacity because that’s essentially how people make money these days as musicians. Now, how do you stay away from these sort of rockers? Jeremy Greenspan I think that’s a difficult one. I tend to be a bit of a... I tend to be a little annoying about these sorts of things. I think... Often people ask me about the state of contemporary dance music and contemporary electronic music and I sort of had a feeling when I was first listening to this kind of music that it was sort of the antithesis to rock & roll. That was what was exciting about it. The guitars were over and that rock & roll as a paradigm for making contemporary music was not important anymore. We could start from a different place, you know. Maybe like a sort of disco place or something like that. Of course that didn’t turn out the way I thought it might. And I suppose the way I think a lot of people might of thought of that. And now, increasingly in dance music even there’s a lot of people making dance music these days where it’s becoming very popular. Where it’s very much kind of rock music made with in dance music format. Torsten Schmidt Without naming any names but... Jeremy Greenspan Without naming any French names. Torsten Schmidt Not any particular names with that I used in the English language as well, but yeah. There’s loads of the lowest common denominator stuff really. Jeremy Greenspan Some of it. Some of it’s very good and some of it’s not very good. Torsten Schmidt We’re not talking about people using stacks of Marshall amps that are not switched on, are we? Jeremy Greenspan For me, I think that when we do live shows it’s difficult and it’s difficult to try and make sure that you don’t do Junior Boys of the rock & roll show. At the same time, anybody who’s ever gone to a show and seen a guy standing behind a laptop knows how tedious that can be. If you’re going to do live music and if you want to be a working musician, you have to or else you’re not going to make any money. You have to try and come up with some kind of compromise whereby you’re doing something that you believe in and at the same time you’re not alienating people or boring them. I don’t know if we have the perfect balance but we increasingly are trying to. We’ve done, we toured the first record, and I don’t think we had such a great show on our first record. We were very eager to try and change what we had done. The idea was to make it much more live in terms of... With the first time ewe toured, there was an element to it, that there was a sort of karaoke element to it that I was never comfortable with, which is that there was a lot of backing tracks going and essentially playing keyboards a little bit and singing over top of that, which, for me, I didn’t think that was a satisfying live experience for either myself or for anybody. The second time, on the second album, we decided that we would first of all get a live drummer, which is quite a large decision to make, because we don’t use live drums at all on the record. I thought a live drummer provided for us a flexibility and also an element of fun and something to look at. With our drummer he certainly is something to look at. Then to use a soft... Torsten Schmidt Is [inaudible] drummer? Jeremy Greenspan No, no. He kind of looks like... You should go to MySpace. He’ll love this. He’ll love me plugging this. myspace.com/fostx – F-O-S-T-X – to get some great shots of him. He makes music as well. Extremely destructive industrial Gothic. I don’t know what it is. Names that are all in Latin and stuff like that. Anyway, we got him to drum for us. We wanted him in specific because he wasn’t a drummer. He was like an old techno DJ or an old techno producer. He did stuff on Plus-A Records and stuff. We thought that he would be coming from a place that could understand us somewhat. Then we just used the...Instead of doing backing tracks, we had the stuff going through a sequencer live, so that Matt, who does mostly electronics, had some flexibility to play around. Then of course I just sing and dance around and so forth. Torsten Schmidt You said if you want to make a living as a musician, you’ve got to be touring. A lot of this music actually does provide for some sort of an audio book kind of play, background. Background is probably too negatively connotated, but it’s more like a listening experience, maybe armchair, headphones, whatever. A comfort zone kind of listening thing. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah. Torsten Schmidt All of a sudden you stand there with the stuff that you did in a comfort zone and you find yourself on a stage carrying some Fender product, a bass or guitars, Strat or whatnot? Jeremy Greenspan Rickenbacker. Torsten Schmidt Some classic rock iconic thing. Jeremy Greenspan A big Lemmy bass guitar, which is what I have. Torsten Schmidt You look into all these faces and they might enjoy it but you just stand there. Jeremy Greenspan We cater, we tend to choose our live set based on trying to make it as exciting a show as it can be. We don’t play many of our... We had a choice as a group. We could have done theater tours. We could have been one of those bands that does theater tours where you go and you play quieter music and people sit down in theaters. Or, we could have done basically rock venue tours. I think we as a band chose to do rock venue tours because I think they’re more exciting to play. We choose sets that are mainly more up tempo stuff and we tend to make it even more up temp when we play it live. Usually we can have a fairly ruckus crowd. I don’t think it matters particularly because we’ve toured with a lot of bands. People will dance to anything. Torsten Schmidt Do they actually dance or is more the friendly nodding type? Jeremy Greenspan No, no, no, no. We get a full dancing crowd. I remember fairly recently we toured in England with Hot Chip, I don’t know if you guys know Hot Chip. They’re a great band. I remember we were playing in Scotland and... Actually I should play you this. I’ll just give you this for a second. Anyway, I was playing this show with them in Scotland in Aberdeen. In my life I’ve never seen a crowd go as crazy in my life just like full on, people smashing their heads and losing their minds to Hot Chip. This is the song that they lost their minds to. (music: Hot Chip - unknown / applause) I just think it’s hilarious that people were moshing to this. People can mosh out to that, I suppose. Torsten Schmidt What’s it like when you play a festival, especially like last summer’s, and all of a sudden you’re backstage and you find yourself in the company of all those skinny bands and skinny jeans and stuff and you’re like... Jeremy Greenspan I think when we first started touring, we do a lot of press. You go into a town and people want to interview you and stuff. The single biggest question that I ever got and I still get it, but the question I always got when we first came out was, “Oh, I didn’t realize you look like that.” I think they expected I would look like a member of Interpol or something. Some sort of ashen, I don’t think they were expecting a tubby Canadian disheveled me. I think hopefully it’s endearing to people that we don’t look the part. Torsten Schmidt Did you ever feel the pressure to get a stylist or get a haircut and all these sort of things? Do some scag and go like... Jeremy Greenspan Every once in a while they do photo shoots for us. They’re always uncomfortable. We’ve done some really strange ones. They thought it’d be funny to go into Brooklyn and go into Junior’s restaurant, which is the most inner city Brooklyn restaurant you could possibly go to and we went in there with these white suits and were drinking milk and stuff like that in this photo. Everybody in that restaurant was just looking at us. It was one of those moments where you walk in and you hear a needle scratch and everybody looks at you. We’ve done all these hilarious... I remember we did a photo shoot once where it was 15 people walking around us with hairsprays and stuff like that. Then they tell you to pose and when someone points a camera at me, my inclination is I’m supposed to smile and look at the camera. When your grandma takes a picture of you, that’s what you do. There’s like hundreds of pictures of us in all these hilarious settings of all this like fog machines and just me going like... I don’t think we’ve ever worked that way as style icons. I don’t think we’re anything that I’m sure the label would be much happier if...In fact, I shaved, I’m not very shaved at the moment. I had a fairly big beard for years. And I shaved it off one day. One of the guys form the label saw a picture of me and he says, “I can’t believe you changed your look.” I said, “My look? I wasn’t sure, I didn’t know I had to consult you on that.” Torsten Schmidt What’s the feeling when you're there at a photo shoot and you’re like oh, damn, am I going like, [inaudible] now? I have to recoup all these people. Everyone who’s getting me some water here, I have to pay them. I need to sell 10 more records for just this one person. I can go get water myself. Jeremy Greenspan I think somebody somewhere is under the delusion that we’re going to be massive stars one day. I think hopefully reality will cath up to them at some point and they’ll be satisfied with us being just puttering along and being a small little band which is what we like to be. Torsten Schmidt Until then, you just use them as a bank with really shitty interest rates. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Torsten Schmidt Another way of recouping some of that is obviously the remix game. You had some remixes early on, you mentioned your friend Kode9 earlier. You had a guy from [inaudible] as well. When you were talking about your Detroit influence, it’s not the worst thing in the world to get a Carl Craig remix is it? Jeremy Greenspan No, that was great. With the remixes, a lot of groups have remixes and remix packages and albums these days. I think what’s good for us and I think refreshing for the label was the fact that we chose all of the remixers. A lot of the bands that will get remixes done, for example, we’ve done some some remixes fairly recently for bands I’m sure who have no idea who we are. We were lucky enough that we were, we could go to the label and say “Listen, this is who we want.” Some of them are friends of ours and some of them are just people we think are great. Obviously Carl Craig is a no-brainer for getting a remix done. Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Probably for the no-brainer business. Let’s get our brain rinsed for a second, because it’s the same track that we used earlier. Just as an example, we could probably break down how that works, because obviously, ideally, most of the people in this room at some stage will get to the point at some stage where they’re going to ring up Carl and go, “Hey, Carl, what you doing?” Jeremy Greenspan C squared. Torsten Schmidt Yeah. C squared. Don’t be square. It’s this thing like until next month and be quicker than with the Tony Allen thing. Just like come on, give us the goods. How does this actually work then? Jeremy Greenspan These remixes, for this album we had I think about 8 remixes done. The majority of them were done by people we were friends with. There’s one by Kode9... Torsten Schmidt Now I’m not in the lucky position to have the... Jeremy Greenspan No, that’s what I was going to get to, basically, was for a couple of them, were people that we were just fans of. The Tensnake remix, I didn’t know him at all, but we really liked his, he had that track last year “Around The House,” which I thought was awesome. Marcin Joels, also, we just wanted to get someone in. Carl Craig, I mean Carl Craig was one of those situations where you’re just like you just put out a list of names of who would you like to get remixed by, and you say Carl Craig, and presumably someone at the label calls him up and says, “Do you want to do this?” He says, “How much?” Then it’s either yes or no. That’s how it’s worked with us. There are people that are very professional remixers and people who do a lot of them. We’ve done several remixes. I don’t like doing remixes, particularly. There’s very few remixes that I’ve done that I’m particularly proud of. For that reason, I’m very reluctant to do them unless they’re for someone that I think is good or unless... I think with Carl Craig, it’s sort of an art form with him. Torsten Schmidt How would you define it art from there? Jeremy Greenspan He’s someone who’s done a lot of remixes and he does them very well. He has a sort of signature to them. Of course, when I first heard Carl Craig, the stuff that... When I think of Carl Craig, I don’t... These days, he has this particular style track that he’s been making. With him I sort of associate him with that bass [inaudible], all the older pre-drum & bass sort of, I don’t know what it is. It’s that break-beaty, jazzy, techno stuff. Torsten Schmidt You mean all the records that everyone always claims that they have. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, exactly, and no one actually has them. Torsten Schmidt It’s like [inaudible] Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, yeah. [inaudible], all that kind of stuff. That’s the stuff I associate with him more. I think when people started talking to me about Carl Craig, I was like Carl Craig, really? Then they played, I think I heard a few things before he did the...H e did this remix I think of “Brazilian Girls” or something that was really incredible. Then he had done ... Shoot, I can’t remember. He did a couple of his own tracks, like two years ago or a year ago, that I thought were also incredible. That’s good, he’s one of the people ... He’s one of those sort of original Detroit guys who’s remained very relevant and sort of exciting. Torsten Schmidt What is it like when, let’s say, you may, in a very unlikely situation, that you may have had a drink. You’re somewhere in the world. It’s 4am, there’s a of couple hundred, maybe even thousands of people there, and you’re getting your swerve on, you might be looking at someone, going like, “[inaudible]” Starting to talk to that person, and all of a sudden, you hear... Jeremy Greenspan Are you asking me dating tips right now? I don’t know where we’re going with this. Torsten Schmidt You know, it’s a holistic experience. Then all of a sudden, you hear your own voice. Jeremy Greenspan Oh, yeah. That doesn’t happen all that often, because, first of all, I don’t go out all that often. That never happens to me in a club, that always happens to me at The Gap, or something like that. I’ll be like, “Fuck it, I’m going to The Gap today. I’m going to buy a scarf.” Or something. Something I don’t need. That’s when I’ll hear one of my songs. Yeah, I just exit very very quickly when that happens. Torsten Schmidt Let’s [inaudible] Gap there for a second and maybe go into this for a bit. (music: Junior Boys - “Like a Child (Carl Craig remix)”) Jeremy Greenspan We had gotten this remix, and we got it while we were on tour. I heard it on my earphones, maybe once or twice, and I sort of said to myself, “You know, I don’t think I get this thing. I don’t get it.” We played in... Who are the Germans in the room here? How many Germans are in the room here at the moment. I know there’s a couple. Torsten Schmidt One, two, three... There. Jeremy Greenspan We went to Panorama Bar, which, OK... Torsten Schmidt Is this where you first heard it? Jeremy Greenspan Yeah. We’re in Panorama Bar we played... Torsten Schmidt The big room or upstairs? Jeremy Greenspan We played in the upstairs bit, which was... It was ridiculous. There was like seven hundred people crammed into this place. Torsten Schmidt Which is the small room. And the more conservative one. Jeremy Greenspan Yeah. We’re in the more conservative room where there’s just a massive photo of a vagina behind us... We play at like, I don’t know, five in the morning or something like that. An early set. Well, you can explain this club, probably better than I can. Have you been there many times? Torsten Schmidt Well, depends. I don’t know. It’s not that many times, but yeah, I think. It’s probably one of the more original club experiences that you can have these days. What’s the main room... Jeremy Greenspan I think it must be some kind of Soviet power bunker or something like that. It’s a former power station so it’s enormously huge. It opens probably at like two in the morning or something like that, and closes...I think it’s open one day a week. It closes at nine the next night, and there’s all sorts of levels. The levels of sexual debauchery that are going on in this club are unspeakable. I think our drummer dropped his jacket in the club and he’s convinced that his jacket has Hepatitis or something like that. Torsten Schmidt [inaudible] We got kicked out of there once. Jeremy Greenspan What’s that? Torsten Schmidt They still do keep order. Jeremy Greenspan Oh yeah, the guys who worked there are great. We were treated terrifically and it was really really great. We had a great show and it was a great time, but it was a very extreme club, to say the least. That was one time when this thing came on, in the main room, and Berghain, I think it’s called. What does that mean? Torsten Schmidt It’s like the home on the hill, but that’s like a name for a little town, really. In a way. Jeremy Greenspan OK. Anyway it was in that main room and this track came on, and when it came on with those massive... Their sound system is unbelievable. It came on and then I think me and Matt were like, “Yeah. Now we get it. Now we get it.” Torsten Schmidt OK, we’ll try to emulate that, so all the men in the room please get your shirts off, grow a mustache and... (music: Junior Boys - “Like a Child (Carl Craig Remix)” / applause) Jeremy Greenspan I think the thing that makes Carl Craig probably a much better remixer than me, for example, is when I do remixes, often what I’ll just do is I’ll just take a vocal from something and I’ll just write a song around it, whereas in that song he uses a lot from the original song. The arpeggio, the string sounds, all of those synth sounds are in the original song, and yet it doesn’t sound anything like the original. It’s kind of ingenious. Torsten Schmidt Is there a depressing element to it as well? Jeremy Greenspan Yeah. Any time you get a remix, the depressing part is hearing someone do something way better than your song. That’s something you’ve just got to learn to live with. Torsten Schmidt When you said earlier you religiously don’t touch the vocals, is it you really need to get someone else to rape your voice and do something else with it that you necessarily wouldn’t do? Jeremy Greenspan It’s not a question of not touching the vocals in terms of not affecting them. I’ll affect them. In fact, we’ve done very bizarre things to my vocals over time. In one of the songs, in our song “Count Souvenirs,” we have my vocals running through a Minimoog actually. We do that kind of thing. What I don’t do is I don’t correct them so much. I don’t run them through something like Antares auto tune and make them sound perfectly in pitch and stuff like that. Torsten Schmidt Unlike other people with French names whose name we wouldn’t bring up here? Jeremy Greenspan To be honest, it’s more like that’s how everyone does vocals. People will ask us, “Don’t you think there’s something dishonest about electronic music?” Or something like that. I’ll say, “If you listen to the latest, I don’t know, Green Day record, who are I guess are a punk band, and then you listen to a record by King Crimson in like 1978, you’ll notice that in the King Crimson record, there’ll be a couple of flubs here and there. They’ll make a couple of mistakes. Whereas if you listen to the Green Day record, you’ll never hear a mistake of any kind. I can assure you it’s not because the guys from Green Day know how to play their instruments better than the guys from King Crimson. It’s because everything is going through a processor which can correct every single mistake.” I think that it’s funny that people will say these things about electronic music, whereas if you listen to the most rootsy alt-country record that was put out last year, I guarantee you it was done on Pro Tools and I guarantee you everything was corrected. I think that’s the sort of position that we’re trying to be an antithesis to, I suppose. Torsten Schmidt It’s kind of interesting that in 2007 you’re still dealing with these questions of authenticity and honesty in music to that degree, and that like, electronic music still has to justify itself, or... Jeremy Greenspan That’s the amazing thing, I think. That’s the thing about when people bring up the ’80s to me that I find the funniest, is when someone will say, “You use synthesizers and make pop music, isn’t that a bit ’80s?” I say, “Well, how come no one ever comes up to the new bands that play guitars and say, “You guys make rock music with guitars, isn’t that a bit 1955?” You know? They don’t have to deal with those kind of questions, I don’t see why I should. Torsten Schmidt Even though, as we learned last week, the most amazing bit is with Mr. Ware, just to fill you in... Temptation, like Human League? Jeremy Greenspan Right. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, that synth there in the back, what do you reckon that is? Jeremy Greenspan The synth in the back of... Torsten Schmidt Oh like the background noises? Jeremy Greenspan I have no idea. Torsten Schmidt Most bets were on either Synclavier or something like that, in the end it turned out to be 128 layers of 50 piece orchestra. I was like, “Oh, someone had budgets to blow.” Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, yeah, exactly. Torsten Schmidt Why is there this longing for getting this almost knightening? Is that what you say? Like when you get knighted by the Queen? But this...Knighting? Knightening? Jeremy Greenspan Knightening, yeah. Torsten Schmidt Yeah. Of like, “Oh, I am a real musician.” Jeremy Greenspan My cousin David is a great musician. Torsten Schmidt Why is everyone called John or David? Jeremy Greenspan Actually everyone I know is named Matt. But anyway, my cousin Dave, he’s a great musician. He’s played on both of our records, and he plays clarinet and he also plays saxophone and flute. I’ll use him on these records, and let me just play... Torsten Schmidt You use him? Jeremy Greenspan Yeah, I use him. Let’s see where... Torsten Schmidt That’s not a very human concept, to use someone. Jeremy Greenspan Well, I employ him, I should say. Here’s a song where he does this little bass clarinet bit. I’ll just play the little bass clarinet solo, wherever it is. (music: Junior Boys - unknown) Torsten Schmidt As we learned earlier this morning, is this more like a wobbler, or more like a weird doubler, or like all the millions of subgenres and using a wobbly bass sound? Jeremy Greenspan Yeah. Torsten Schmidt Where does this fall into? Jeremy Greenspan This one? Yeah, I don’t know. This is wobblestep. Sure. Anyway, he gets furious when he hears what I do with his...He’s like, “That doesn’t even sound like a clarinet anymore, you could have done that with a synth.” I was like, “Yeah, but I wanted to...” Now, I just do it to piss him off. You’re just talking about musicianship and stuff. The most talented musician I know, is a guy named Mike Kelley. He’s a viola player from Juilliard which is the best music school in the world, I guess. He makes this sort of disco music and plays strings on it and stuff like that and he does all these incredible sort of string arrangements and vocal arrangements. He apparently, so the story goes, he had to do a final presentation in Juilliard on the kind of music that he was doing, and came and played them his disco stuff, and apparently caused a near riot, so I’ll play a couple of seconds. His band is called Kelley Polar, and here’s just a couple of seconds. (music: Kelley Polar - unknown / applause)

Jeremy Harding
Jamaica’s Jeremy Harding, leading exponent of dancefloor riddims, unloads a wealth of knowledge and experience in this riveting talk at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy. From playing house music on Canadian radio, Harding went on to discover Sean Paul and work in the studio with Sly & Robbie. His cool, calm and collected approach combined with his infinite passion for music of all styles will teleport you out of the studio and off to an island sunset for two hours.
Hosted by Toby Laing He’s a very busy man at the moment and an outstanding contributor to global music, traveling around the world, ending up in Japan, New Zealand, Antarctica. The sounds of these rhythms that he’s been making in Jamaica are just turning up everywhere. It’s great that he’s taken time out to come and talk to us today, so cheers. Thanks for that. Jeremy Harding Thanks for having me, I appreciate it. Toby Laing I don’t know if you want to start with some music, or if you want to... Jeremy Harding Sure, I’ll play like five or six things. Some stuff I produced, some I engineered on and mixed. Hopefully you guys are familiar with most of it. (music: Beenie Man – “Who Am I”) (music: Tanto Metro & Devonte – “Give It To Her”) (music: Kevin Lyttle – “Turn Me On”) (music: Sean Paul feat. Rahzel – “Top Of The Game”) (music: Sean Paul – unknown) (music: Sean Paul – “Breakout”) Toby Laing Hearing a collection of productions like that, it’s interesting to work out how you came to music in the first place, when you were young, because I know you haven’t always been pursuing this career as a producer in dancehall music. Jeremy Harding I started off in Kingston. I’m from Kingston, Jamaica, born and raised, and I started off enrolling in a traditional music school. Choir lessons, playing guitar in little productions you have on stage when you’re a kid. This is seven, eight, nine, to 13 years old. I took an interest in guitar and at that stage I was convinced I was going to be a great rock guitarist, the next Hendrix. I wanted to go to Musicians Institute in California. My parents said, “No, you’re going to go to boarding school first.” So I went to school in Ottawa in Canada. Did two years at that, I said, “Now [Musicians Institute].” They said, “No, you’re going to university.” So I went to Montreal, to McGill University, to do chemical engineering. All this time I’m still thinking I’m going to be this great guitar player. Montreal had a very vibrant club scene – this was around about ‘88, ‘89, ‘90 – a very vibrant club scene. This was around the time when you had the whole UK Soul II Soul movement and that music was coming across. I got involved in that club scene. So I was chatting to DJs, wanting to know the music that they played. Of course, you couldn’t buy it on a CD in a shop, so me and a friend of mine, who was from New York, started going to the import shops and buying all these 12”s from the UK. Started off with the harsher stuff, like Ministry and Nitzer Ebb, we used to buy these 12”s. Then, as the more mainstream house came out, we used to buy records and make tapes for ourselves in the dorm room. We figured out at McGill they had soundsystem equipment for when they had frat parties. So we went and opened the store room, threw out all these boxes, and there’s all these [Technics] 1200 [turntables] sitting there and a mixer. So we grabbed the stuff, took it to our rooms, started making tapes. So my friend now, he’s from New York, Jewish kid from Manhattan, he’s into A Tribe Called Quest A Tribe Called Quest, Native Tongues, Black Sheep, Red Alert and all this kind of music. And I had all this reggae stuff, reggae tapes that I’d bring from back in Jamaica, so we started DJing on campus together, playing frat parties. Eventually we got this college radio station show, CKUT 90.3FM, which was more than just a college station, it was like the only real urban station in the whole city. Because Montreal is French, it’s all very Canadian content and French music. The only place to hear hip-hop and dancehall or reggae or dance was on that college station. So we did that for three or four years, and by now I realized there was a music production school in Montreal called Trebas Institute. So I dropped out of McGill. It’s very hard to get in, to get out is easy. You walk in and say, “Hi, I’d like to withdraw.” They say thank you and take your card: “OK, goodbye.” So I left. My parents of course were ecstatic about that move, and I went to this music production school while I was DJing at the clubs, and started to learn about MIDI and keyboards and sequencers all this stuff. Of course, by now I’d sold the guitar and bought a Numark mixer and a 1200, so my whole path had changed by then. I started working in clubs, I was DJing playing house music and reggae, so I had two audiences, really. We’d play black music, dancehall and reggae at the black clubs. And then we’d also play the house clubs, the whole Montreal gay house vibrant scene. It’s two types of music. But it reached a point in Montreal where if you weren’t French, if you weren’t white and you weren’t gay, then it was a ceiling and you were stuck there. It didn’t matter how good a DJ you were. I wasn’t French, I didn’t speak French, I wasn’t white and I wasn’t gay, so my progress as a DJ in that scene got stunted very quickly. They knew I could play music on the radio show, but I just didn’t fit in to that whole culture – you’re still a foreigner, you don’t speak the language. You were a cool black guy, but you weren’t a gay black guy, it just didn’t work for them. So I just concentrated more on the black music and started playing more hip-hop and reggae. The show was called Native Tongues and that was our whole focus. At this point I was convinced I was going to be a DJ. That was my new calling, no more guitar – I’m going to remix and produce hip-hop acts and that sort of stuff. I found some local rap talent in Montreal and started a little clique of production where I was producing these kids, producing a radio show, and also I would DJ in clubs. So if they’d come to my house and make demos, I could play them on the radio. So they’d feel like they’re in the hands of a big producer because they could hear their stuff on the radio. Then every big rap act that came to Montreal, we’d get them to open up. So my whole roster was that we had the baddest producer, we had the baddest radio show and you open for all the acts, everything was moving along that path. Of course, after a while, you’re still broke, because you’re DJing once or twice a week and getting paid like 80 to 100 Canadian dollars. You still have to eat, pay rent, you have to buy records. You’re a DJ now, you have all these expenses. It wasn’t working out, so I moved to Toronto for one year because people convinced me Toronto had this big musical scene, all these rap artists having hits, but after a year I realized there really wasn’t anything there for me anymore in Canada. I reached a certain point where I realized this stuff was so local, it wasn’t going to go much further than this. I went back to Jamaica. A friend of mine who I knew from school days was working for an advertising agency. He said, "Have you ever made jingles, like adverts, for radio or television?" I said, "Well, when those guys used to throw parties, we used to make the ads for the parties. Which is happening at which club, but I never tried it before." He says, "OK, fine," so he started giving me jingle work and coaching me to make jingles. So now I turned into a jingle producer. I’m making jingles for the banks, and some kind of fruit drink, or whatever product that was available. It was paying the rent, it was good money. So I’m doing jingles, and [I meet] a younger brother who has started to get involved in a soundsystem in Jamaica, right, a crew of DJs. Now I had this studio because I brought back the gear which I had from Montreal. I set up a small studio. He says, “Listen, can we use the studio to do dubplates and record stuff from artists?” I said, “Sure, no problem.” So he started bringing artists over. Cobra, Buccaneer, Capleton, Beenie Man... I think, at the time, Don Youts. Reggae guys at the time. They come over and we start cutting dubs. We didn’t have the lacquer to cut the dubs but we recorded to DAT. And the soundsystem would take the DAT and then go press the dubs. So, I’m still convinced now that I’m going to be a hip-hop producer, it’s just a matter of time, right? I’m just doing this to pay the bills. Eventually he says to me, “We should try to do a production, a dancehall reggae production.” I said, “I never though about producing dancehall, I never tried to produce dancehall.” My approach to producing dancehall was like how a hip-hop producer produces hip-hop. I had an S950 sampler, I had my sequencer, and I started thinking like, “Alright, put on this record. OK, that’s a cool song right there. Woop, let me sample that sound. Let me sample this, let me sample that.” The whole approach was I was thinking like a hip-hop producer, sampling bits and pieces from various things and putting it together, whereas typical reggae dancehall production is not like that. It’s more musician based. Some guy comes in and plays a keyboard, a guy hooks up a bass. But I was thinking like a hip-hop producer. So I did a couple of rhythms, and the second one was where we did Beenie Man, “Who Am I?” That worked really well. That record came out. I think I remember the morning when I felt that I had done something, David Rodigan
call me from London. Right? Rodigan, famous reggae DJ. He called me, he was like, [puts on British accent] “May I speak to Jeremy Harding, please?” I was like, “Speaking.” He said, “Hi, this is David Rodigan.” I was like, “Holy fuck. Hey, Rodigan.” He says, “Do you know what you’ve done? You’ve got a massive hit over here in the UK with Beenie Man. It’s taking off, it’s amazing, incredible.” And he’s like gassing up on the phone. I’m like, “Man, this thing is really something special.” I think when I reached that point, then I kind of realized, well, I guess now I’m a dancehall reggae producer. I’m not going to be a rock guitarist. I stopped DJing, I’m not going to make jingles anymore. Now I’m a dancehall reggae producer, and from there we went into full steam and just started producing and getting involved in the whole dancehall scene in Jamaica. Toby Laing So it was the right place at the right time? You didn’t really expect to end up doing this. Jeremy Harding Yeah, I think it was just like a path, you understand? Everything led up to something else. I think the DJing got me into club culture and understanding DJing, and the club, and playing on the radio and understanding how DJs like records to be made for them. Learning the production side of it now, putting that with the DJing and how to produce, led me to produce the way that I produce. It’s all a progression. I think everything helped. Up to even last year, I still had my DJ stuff set up in the studio. I don’t DJ anymore but it’s such a part of me. I need to have my Vestax and my two 1200s, just there, even when I’m making music. I’m not DJing, but something just tells me that you need to refer back to this, because you’re making music for the street and for the clubs. So I press my own lacquer 45s and put them on. Play it, say, “Yeah, yeah, all right.” Queue up this one and play that one and feel like, yeah, I made the record right because I can play them so I understand... You know what I mean? It’s always a point of reference. Toby Laing An understanding of where this music is going to be going. You were away from Jamaica for a number of years there. It seems that you’ve got a perspective on the island’s music from outside that you brought back. Jeremy Harding Yeah, definitely. A lot of comments I hear people say about my music is that it doesn’t sound like the regular dancehall stuff in Jamaica, it has a lot of hip-hop influence in it, sometimes a dance music thing to it. Like that record I played earlier, the Devonte & Tanto Metro, with the Auto-Tune on the voice, the Cher. That was me reading a magazine about Cher when she did [sings a line from Cher’s “Believe”] and I went out and did it on a dancehall record and it blew everyone’s mind. “How did you do this? It’s the most incredible thing.” You understand? And then like five other producers did it for three or four years afterwards and killed it. I blame myself for that, my apologies for all those reggae records with that fucking Auto-Tune thing, overkill. But it’s just different influences. I can take this and make it part of dancehall music. Why not? My scope is different. I’m from Jamaica, but I am a musician, I can play a guitar, I know music, I’ve played in bands, but I have also DJed in clubs and the radio, I know what that’s like, too. And now I’m making the music behind the glass, so it’s just bringing all those things into my approach. Toby Laing Do you still play music on your productions? You still playing the guitar? Jeremy Harding No, I’ve put the guitar into my hobby side of music. Maybe sometimes I can bring it together, but I was into guitar like Hendrix and Van Halen and Robert Johnson and Clapton, and I haven’t found out how that integrates into dancehall yet. I go home and fool on a guitar, read a magazine and figure out how to do a solo, but then it’s time to go into the studio and make reggae. It’s a separate discipline. Toby Laing In that time that you were away did the country change very much? Jeremy Harding Well, I was still coming back for vacations. I was coming home at Easter, at Christmas, going to the record shop to load up on my 45s, ‘cause I had this radio show to support. So I had to make sure to come to Jamaica, get all this new music and take it back to Montreal, because it would take them months to catch up anyway. I was keeping in touch with what was happening, I wasn’t far out of the loop. My friend used to do the same from New York with the hip-hop, that’s how we’d run it. Toby Laing Could you see technology changing the music culture of Jamaica in that time? Jeremy Harding In that time it didn’t really change. I would say it changed radically in the last six years, from maybe ‘98, ‘99. That’s when the change started to take effect. Before that everything was two-inch tape, everything was big analog mixing boards. A very old school way of making records. Akai drum machines, but everything else would be live on top. I’ve started sessions with Sly Dunbar and their whole way of working is for Sly to build up a drum track and lay it down on tape and then everything else is live. They don’t sequence past the drums or what they’re doing. Robbie will come in and play bass live and Lenky, or whichever keyboardist they’re using, will play live the full length of the song, just play it down. And they keep adding and stacking and that’s the way in which they make it. When I came back to Jamaica and started going to studios, I once walked into a session with Michael Rose from Black Uhuru – this is a Sly & Robbie session. So of course Michael Rose, Sly & Robbie – reggae Grammy winners, legends. I’m going to see how these guys work. Walk into the studio, but you can’t see anything, it’s full of weed smoke, so it’s like this [mimics spliff rolling] with all these rastas lined up on the wall rolling weed. The whole place is like that. The engineer is there, he has a TV monitor and he’s watching Raiders Of The Lost Ark or something like that. Casually, this tape machine beside him. Then Robbie sitting there saying, “Ready?” Press record. Watch TV. Then Robbie’s like, “Yo, hold on, stop, let me take out my gun [mimics removing gun from waistline and putting it on table]. Alright, ready again.” He presses the thing, and Robbie’s like this [mimics playing bass], plays this thing. About ten guys turn up, not to play the session but just to smoke weed in the studio. They’re sitting there smoking and puffing. Michael Rose is in the corner watching Indiana Jones. I’m looking at the speakers, a pair of NS10s, and of course the tweeters are blown long time. You know the little square tweeters they put in car boxes? They have them stuck in the round holes with tape. All the meters are on red, everything is peaking, totally [laughter]. This is frightening, this is two Grammy winners, Sly & Robbie and Michael Rose from Black Uhuru, and that’s how they made music. The volume is ridiculous, they have these big JBL horn boxes, it’s cranked so you can’t hear nothing, you can’t see nothing. Engineer’s watching cable, whatever. And it’s amazing. But when you hear back the track… bambaclaat! [imitates rhythm track] And Michael Rose is there belting. That’s the way those guys work, that’s the attitude. And those guys in there smoking the weed, they’re giving you the feedback because they’re going [mimics puffing], “Yeah, man, wicked. Go on. Murder!” “You like that?” “Yeah, man, wicked.” There’s Robbie Shakespeare, he has his Sigma 9mm on the desk, you know, but it worked for them, it worked for them. Toby Laing And so your studio is a bit like that as well [laughs]? Jeremy Harding No. When Jamaica caught up to the computer late and then all these kids start realizing they can get a PC, get a program and record stuff in their house, the shift started to happen, away from the bigger studios to smaller studios at producers’ houses. Part of the reason why you had so much talent emerging and part of the problem of why growth was so difficult was the way those studios work. If you’re at Mixing Lab or Penthouse Records, where Buju Banton and those guys were, you have the studio, then the perimeter, then the gate. Everybody’s trying to be an artist, so they’re hanging out by the gate, all these wannabe artists. The producers and engineers will be making beats, making tracks, and they’ll look outside and say, “I wonder who’s out there. Let me hear you, come.” And the guy would come and sing at his shoulder. “No, no. You, come here. OK, I like that.” They pick people that way. All those artists are dudes that hang out by the gate every day and refused to go away. So when you have Dave Kelly and those producers at Penthouse – and Penthouse at the time was doing Bob Andy and Marcia Griffiths and those kind of reggae records – and there’s this little kid outside calling himself Buju, and Dave says, “Let me hear you.” So Buju come in [sings], “Gal yuh see yuh battyrider, murder.” “Me love me car, me love bike, me love money an’ ting.” And he’d record him. So that’s how you found the artists. But at the same time it doesn’t work well for developing artists because that’s all you’re doing, auditioning artists. You don’t have the time to sit down and say, “OK, these are the two artists I’m going to work with, everybody else please leave.” So the more modern producers who have their home studios, that can’t work, obviously. You can’t have 30 guys at the gate, they live in a residential area, the whole thing is a lot more closed circuit. And they start dealing with computers and hard drives. Before they got them they were doing ADAT and Tascam V–80 digital tapes, smaller formats. So their process might be a little bit different, not so many hangers–on. But different people work differently. I prefer to do my stuff on my own, and when it’s finished I let everybody hear it. If I don’t like it, I just trash it. I don’t let anybody hear it. I don’t rely on a room of people because the more popular you get, the more yes men you have around. Any rubbish you do it’s, “Wicked, that bad, you’re the boss, murder.” And you’re sitting there like, “I don’t really like it, though.” I prefer to work alone on a track, and as far as recording is concerned, some artists want to be private, they don’t want the feedback, they come alone. Like
Vybz Kartel, they just come alone, they don’t want a whole lot of people there, they just want to work on their song, and that’s it. Other people travel with this whole entourage. If you ever record Capleton, he has ten guys that have to roll with him. He just can’t come by himself. Beenie Man used to come with five or six guys, because they need their boys around them to support them. Also, there’s a lot of ghostwriters in dancehall and reggae. You read the credits, it was written by Capleton. It was actually written by three other guys. It says Beenie Man, but it wasn’t written by Beenie Man, it was written by Future Troubles or Gringo or some other artist he was hanging around with. So the artist has this entourage. Vybz Kartel used to write songs for Bounty Killer, he’d follow Bounty Killer everywhere. “Yo, Vybz, listen to this riddim.” And he’d be [mimics writing lyrics a piece of paper]. And Killer would say, “Yeah, ready,” and he’d go into the studio [with the lyrics]. But these guys have ghostwriters because we don’t have a formal system of publishing and radio stations paying royalities and all those things, so basically those guys were writing for them. [The artist would] take care of them. They go to a club, they buy them liquor, they need a new car, new pair of rims. They go to New York, they come back and say, “Yo, hold this chain, hold these shoes.” So they’re rolling with the big man. They’re really ghostwriters. Almost every artist in Jamaica has them. Elephant Man, Beenie Man. Capleton, the people around him used to write for him. Bascom X used to write for Frisco Kid. Some of them perform in their own right, some never do, some are good writers but don’t have the voice to be an artist. There’s another reason the entourage has to come, because they’re building vibes.
“Yeah man, let’s go the studio and build vibes.” It just means, let’s go to the studio and try and get this thing written. It can be anything from smoking a spliff, drinking, to cracking jokes, exchanging stories. That’s very important for them. If the artist don’t like you as a producer, you can’t sit round and build vibes for them. Toby Laing Jamaican music has been traveling the world for 40 years in different ways and that community’s style of making music, it seems like there are a lot of people involved, there’s a lot of collaborations, things that can’t be written down. Maybe there’s a ghostwriter working, or someone might be copying somebody else, but there’s something deep going on in that music. But when you sell a record in Jamaica, that’s not where your main source of income is coming from, is it? Jeremy Harding No, the artists make money off dubplates, or the specials, which they record for the soundsystems, or they make money off the shows. That’s the source of income, not the actual sale of the records. A hit record in Jamaica, a hit 45, is going to sell 6,000 copies and they’re selling for $50 Jamaican dollars, which is like 80 cents US. By the time you cut that down to what an artist makes it’s peanuts, maybe a couple hundred US dollars. Forget that, they’re not even trying to pay royalties, it doesn’t make any sense. The 6,000 copies were probably purchased by 6,000 soundsystem guys across the world. So you have guys in Europe, US, Japan, playing this record and making it popular, and people call Jamaica wanting a show: “We need a show with Beenie Man. How much you charge? $15,000? No problem. Send them the tickets.” So they’re touring constantly and doing shows because of the output of records. If you’re a traditional rap artist, or R&B, anybody, you do an album, you promote the single, you do a video, you do the next single, the next video, and the album goes for a year. You do a tour in the summer for three months, and then maybe you take some time out to record the next album. Jamaican artists, these guys are recording three, four singles a week, so after four months they may have 40 songs. Elephant Man, Sizzla, you should see how these guys work. I’ve seen Sizzla record six songs a night working for Don Corleone, producers like that. He comes to your studio, you better have more than just one track or you’re wasting his time. “I want six tracks now.” Boom, first track, rip through it. Next one, rip though it, rip through it. So the amount of work that they’re doing, the turnover is so constant, they always have 15 songs out there, maybe five or six of them are hits in the dancehall community, so they’re constantly doing shows. That’s they way they make their money. Producers make money by licensing their tracks to the people who put out compilations – VP Records, Greensleeves Records, Jet Star. And then you guys go and buy Reggae Gold, Strictly the Best, Ragga Ragga, Greensleeves samplers, all of the reggae compilations. That’s how the producers make their money. So it’s a very different system from how people usually make money off records. Toby Laing So the music is still getting around there, it’s just bootlegging and illegal copying of CDs? Jeremy Harding Part of the problem is that people in Jamaica think that the music is them and belongs to them. They don’t think they should have to pay for the music. They figure, we’re in Jamaica, these are Jamaicans, it is our music. So a guy records a song, I love this song, I’m going to go to the stage or the club and make a lot of noise for him, this song should be mine. I’m going to beg the CD, I don’t have to buy that. I’m going to buy Usher’s album or R. Kelly’s album, because they’re not from Jamaica, they’re big R&B acts, they’re on MTV, I’ll purchase their record. But I don’t have to buy Bounty Killer’s album, why do I need to buy Bounty Killer’s album? I see him everyday, I see him on the road. “Yo, Killer, wagwan?” “My yout, what’s up?” So their whole mentality is they don’t buy the music. Even worse, now you get into the downloading thing. We have guys selling music online telling you they’re promoting your artist. What do you mean, you’re promoting my artist – you’re robbing me, you’re selling the music online, where’s this money going? They’re selling mix CDs, like “We’re promoting your artist.” You’re not, you’re selling 20,000 copies of your mix CD with six of my songs on there and then when my compilation comes back I’ve only sold 10,000 copies. So you’re cutting it right from under me. They don’t get it. They think it’s a mix CD. But this is not hip-hop where you can sell 50,000 or 100,000 mix CDs, whatever, because Jay-Z
is going to sell six million. For Jay-Z, it’s promotion – a DJ Clue mix CD, sure, get it out on the street, because my major label record deal can afford for me to sell millions of records and I can do big tours and have big endorsements and have Reebok shoes and whatever. But the Jamaican guys, your CD sales means I can’t sell my normal CD. So with the web and the downloading and the MP3 trading, it’s difficult. That’s why we have to hustle to find all these ways to make money. Toby Laing MTV has had a huge impact on the local scene. How long has that been happening? Jeremy Harding People in Jamaica got cable in about ‘97, ‘98. Before that the only people who could watch MTV or BET were people who could afford a satellite DSS system or whatever, a very small percentage of kids. So once you got cable, which basically started as illegal cable – a bunch of business people get together in a building, throw a satellite receiver on the roof and split off the signal and feed the whole community and charge them. That was going on for years until the US [communications regulator] FCC said, “No, no, you can’t just buy one subscription for HBO and feed 200 people on the road and charge money. What are you doing?” So they put in regulations, but the point was that it had sprung up so much. So now, even if you’re an uptown middle-class kid or a ghetto kid, you had cable, you had MTV. Now everybody is like, “Oh fuck, MTV, BET.” They could get this information. So it started to affect how they were making music. They knew what the DJ was DJing about, how they dressed, everything. They latched into the culture. The language barrier at first, they couldn’t really understand how Snoop Dogg talks and all the slang, but they could understand their attitude, the same perspective. Particularly gangster rap music took to Jamaica really well, and even now the kids love that kind of rap music more. Tribe Called Quest, they’re not interested in that side of hip-hop. They like Snoop Dogg, Dre, 50 Cent, or the Southern [hip-hop], Paul Wall, the grills, the hardcore hip-hop, because it mirrors their culture. Hip-hop mirrored dancehall in the early days, so there’s this exchange constantly going on. It’s influenced the culture to the point where it’s ridiculous. You see dancehall artists going on stage wearing North Carolina Tar Heels cap and they don’t even know where it is or what sport it is. But they see Fabolous is wearing the throwback jersey and they go, “Yeah, Fabolous, bad rapper.” And they want to dress like him. They get the baseball caps and the whole thing, and they go through this cycle of cultural exchange. You hear records about drive-bys. Jamaica is a violent countr,y but drive-bys is not our culture. Jamaican culture is when you want to shoot somebody, you walk straight up to the man and say, “Yo, pussy!” Boom, like that. It’s an aggressive culture, not like drive-by, boom, boom, boom and drive off. They want everybody to know. They walk up to the dude and, “Yo pussy, a long time now you been a bumbaclaat!” Blat-blat! It’s very different. Toby Laing I don’t know if I can even understand what it’s like to live in Kingston. Jeremy Harding They say the most warrior-like slaves were dropped off in Haiti and Jamaica. Serious thing, you know? The whole slave trade, the most warrior-like tribes were dropped off there. Those cultures are the most violent and aggressive in the Caribbean and it affects everything about how they operate. If you go to other places in the Caribbean – Trinidad, Barbados and all the other countries, they speak differently, they make soca music. [affects accent] “Soca, party time, how you doin’ man?” And they’re happy and funny. And in Jamaican it’s, “Yo, wha gwaan?” Everything’s dark and the music is slow and everyone smokes weed. They’re happy, they’re not upset with you, that’s just how they are. They speak in low tones [affects deep voice]. [Elsewhere in the Caribbean] you go to the carnival parades and see all the feathers. In Jamaica the trucks are like this [mimics playing a slow, heavy bassline] and everyone’s like [imitates smoking weed]. Everybody’s a bad boy, everybody’s aggressive. But it’s part of the whole culture and they come to the US and get infamous for being in gangs in New York and the whole drug trade. And look at Haiti, it’s in turmoil, and the poor and the class situation. And they really say, in the slave trade, with the warrior-like tribes, they got to Jamaica and said, “You get off now.” And the happier tribes they took to other places. So the warrior guys sit down in these islands brooding for generations and it affects your whole culture, the music, the food you eat. Jamaica is pepper and hot food. The whole thing changes. Toby Laing Dancehall does sound like it’s actually channelling something quite ancient. There’s a pulse to it. Maybe you don’t know that if you’re close to the source, but if you listen to it from far away, it sounds like music that has always been beneath the surface, that someone has just tapped into. But if you go clubbing in Jamaica, are you just as likely to go to a club that plays R&B or hip-hop? Jeremy Harding No, all the clubs play a mix of music now. The DJs now have to. There was a time when you had Stone Love and they played reggae and dancehall and that’s it. But now, all the soundsystems and all the DJs play a mix of everything. Mostly dancehall and reggae, a lot of hip-hop, some R&B, maybe the edgier kind of R&B stuff, they don’t really play much dance. You have some DJs who specialise in playing dance, like trance and techno, but they have very small followings. But that’s pretty much what you’re going to hear. They all have to be able to mix it up. You can’t have a hip-hop night, it doesn’t work. You have to be playing some dancehall. And if you bring big hip-hop artists out to Jamaica, you have to have dancehall guys on the bill. Or if you have an R&B artist, same thing, because otherwise people won’t come. They want to see Usher or Lil’ Jon or Wyclef, but they won’t go to see Usher or Lil’ Jon or Wyclef. If you put Bounty Killer, Elephant Man and Sizzla on it as well, then they’ll go. You still always have to bring it back to reggae and dancehall, they always want a piece of that in it, no matter what you’re doing. Toby Laing So these dancehall artists, even though they’re blowing up in the States, the work they do every day at home is what’s really important, rather than moving to New York City or whatever? Jeremy Harding It just doesn’t work because the culture changes too rapidly. You’ve had reggae artists out of New York, Red Fox and Mad Lion. Shaggy pretty much is a New York reggae artist, a kid that left Jamaica and grew up in the whole New York scene. You have guys like that but they have limited success. Shaggy’s a whole next thing by himself, but in general the culture changes too fast. The rhythms change too quickly, the slang changes too quickly. You can’t write a song after being out of Jamaica for a year. People will look at you, Jamaican kids will say, “What’s he doing that for? We don’t talk about that anymore, we don’t look like that, we don’t dress like that. That’s not what the street is.” The language, the talk, is so quick. We had this thing where you used to greet somebody with your fist like this [knocks fists together], then all of a sudden it changed to this [knocks fists while lifting thumbs up]. I don’t know who makes this stuff up, but then it’s this thing with your thumb, and you have to do it like two, three, four times. I asked people where it comes from and some man says, “Yeah, man, it’s a badman thing, when you cock the gun with your thumb.” What the fuck? Then the next man says it’s not that, it’s a rasta thing, because rastas have this thing about the Pope being evil and Catholicism being this and so on. And they say it’s popping off the Pope’s head. So you don’t even know where it comes from, but it just changes so quickly. The next one is the “lion paw,” so if you greet someone and they do that [puts palms together with fingers interlocking] and then another where they say, “Bless,” and touch the heart. A lot of these expressions come out of Rastafari and spread into the general street culture. All the kids in the street going [shows a mix of all these gestures]. It changes so quickly. You’re in New York, Miami, whatever, and you go, “Yeah, I’m a reggae producer.” You don’t even know, it changes so fast, the slang, the expressions. You can’t really keep up. Toby Laing So you just lose touch. Jeremy Harding Yeah, culture moves so rapidly. Toby Laing It sounds like a tough environment to live in, but obviously if you are born there, used to it, you can... Jeremy Harding Just like anywhere else. People said New York is a tough environment to live in. It depends where you’re going. You know the places where you need to stay out of, or what you’re going to get mixed up in. It’s the same type of thing. So if you live in Kingston, you live in Jamaica… If you’re not a drug dealer, and you’re not a murderer, and not trying to kill people, and you’re not hanging out in certain areas, you’re not putting yourself into certain situations... As far as the music is concerned, everything is now moved into uptown Kingston anyway. You don’t have to go to the ghetto to these dances anymore. They’ve brought it uptown. It’s all in the night clubs. It’s in the night spots uptown. It’s on hip strip. You see what I’m saying? Even entry level right now, if I want to jump into dancehall music in Jamaica it doesn’t mean you have to make this pilgrimage down into some really bad territory and hang out with the wrong crowd to get the music. You understand? You got four or five radio stations playing the music. You can go right in the business district uptown, there’s the IBM building, the Scotiabank and then there’s a club. That’s the spot for dancehall now. That is it. The club and the security and beep, metal detector. You’ve got like a regular night club. You know what I mean? Toby Laing Is there a competitive nature to the industry there? Do the producers get on with the other producers or artists with artists? There occasionally seems to be problems between artists, is that serious? Jeremy Harding It’s extremely competitive, because everybody feels as though it’s a small pie and they’re all trying to get a piece of it. I think the new generation of artists have a better relationship now. I’m good friends with a lot of these producers out there, like Shams, Don Corleone and Birch. If any of you follow dancehall and read the album credits, you’ll see their names. And I’m friends with Steely & Clevie and Sly & Robbie. We’re not buddies, but I could call them on the phone, I could ask them questions about stuff. The whole thing is different. With early reggae music, the cost to put together a studio… We need the same studio as everyone else to make the records, but we’re only selling 5,000 copies at less than a dollar a song, so the cost to put together the studio and how difficult it was meant the thing that came out would be, “I’m the boss, I control the studio, I’m the producer, you artists are nothing. You should be happy to record for me.” So the relationship was different. You were the big man. “I am Coxsone Dodd, Stereo One. Who the fuck are you, some pickle artist? I own this big tape machine, this big board, you should be happy I let you record here. When you finish, sign this piece of paper.” [mimics writing on paper] “I sign all my rights to this song to Coxsone Dodd, all my publishing, all of my royalties, my first-born child, everything.” [Laughter] Not to try and cut up
Coxsone Dodd and these guys, they were producers, they made good records, but the whole reasoning was a lot different. A lot of them weren’t there in the studio making these records, they just owned the place. So the artists had no choice. You wanted to record, you had to sign that paper to make the song. The relationship has changed now, where the artist and the producer are on the same level. Like, I will play soccer with Wayne Marshall. He comes to my house to play Playstation. He knows I’m the producer and he’s the artist, but we’re friends. It’s not like, “I’ve got this big Pro Tools rig and who the fuck are you?” It’s more like a working thing, we’re the same generation, we can go the sporting club and talk shit. “Yo, I’ve got a new track.” “OK, let me hear it.” Boom. Then we’ll go into the studio and it shifts to where I’m the producer, “Tell me what to do, I’m the artist, I need to take instruction from you.” Then when it’s all said and done, we’ll go back in front of the TV and play Fifa. So that relationship is a lot different now. Toby Laing So the legal things have changed with publishing? Jeremy Harding Nobody’s trying to behave that way anymore. They’re more aware. I build a track, you bring the lyrics, 50% is me, 50% is you. Some guy plays keyboards on it, I give him a little piece of the publishing. It’s not like a big issue, we’re a lot more knowledgeable about it now. In the past you could do what you want because the artist wouldn’t dare come back and say anything. Now, they’ll come back and say, “What’s the deal with the publishing?” “What do you mean?” “Because I saw the thing and... dude, we hang out and play video games all the time. You trying to jack me for my publishing? What’s going on?” Before, you’re the big heavy producer, the artist is a mouse. He can’t come back to you and ask you for money. Impossible, no way. Toby Laing You’ve got into another side of things with artist management and projects. You manage Sean Paul? Jeremy Harding I manage Sean. I never intended to be an artist manager, or really to manage him, but when we had found him, my brother heard him DJing at this little outdoors club and said, “Yo, my bigger brother just came back from Canada and he has a small studio, you should come by.” My brother said to me, “I saw this kid and he sounds like Super Cat. He’s wicked.” So Sean came and DJed a few things, and he did sound like Super Cat. If Sean sings a Super Cat song for you, you can’t believe. Now he has his own style, but back then, the living Super Cat. So we recorded a few songs with him. My studio was the first one where he had a chance to come and work, be a reggae artist and record. I thought he had a great-sounding voice. On record Sean was always fantastic. As an individual [performer], his stage show was weak and he might not really look the part, but when you heard him it was unmistakable. “Is that a Super Cat record? It must be a Spragga Benz record.” ‘Cause he had the chops to do it on the record. I kept working with him and his records are coming out with my name and number so people are calling my studio and my house. “Yeah, wha’ gwan? The artist Sean Paul, I want to book him for a show.” “Yeah, OK.” “Yeah, a show in Miami, how much do you charge?” So I’d look at Sean, “How much do you charge?” He’d be, “I don’t know.” So I’d say, “$2,000?” “Yeah, no problem. How many people flying?” So I’d look at him, “Shall I come with you?” “Yeah.” “Two tickets.” And we’d just go. I’d go and carry the instrumentals, the tickets, I’ll collect the money backstage. I go with him, I get up onstage, I cue him so he does a little show, we’ll finish, I go to the promoter, I get the money. I’m doing this for three years. At the same time I’m thinking, “That’s cool, I’m helping this kid out, and I get to fly all over the place. And I’m a producer, I’m making songs with Beenie Man and Elephant Man, I’m happy. Sean’s cool, but I’m helping him out.” But then it dawns on you after four years that you’re managing him. You realize you’re his manager, they’re calling you for everything. His shows are coming through you, you’re collecting the money. He’s looking to you for guidance. We go shopping in New York, the stores look at us like we’re lovers. “Sean, I think these pants look really good on you.” “I don’t know.” “What’s going on here? This black dude telling this guy how to dress?“ Sean doesn’t care about these things, he doesn’t care about clothes and jewelry and bullshit. He just cares about music. “Why do I need to buy that?” He doesn’t really get it to this day. He dresses well now, but he doesn’t really take his money and go shopping. Stylists come to music videos and give him clothes and he’s like, “Can I keep that? How much is it?” His whole thing was different, but you end up doing so many things on his behalf. You start to realise, I’m managing this kid. Not with a signed contract. At that point I wasn’t even taking any money from him because I was doing well as a producer so I didn’t really see the point. He does a show for two thousand dollars, I’m going to take two hundred dollars? It doesn’t make any sense. I’ve had a big hit, David Rodigan’s calling me. I’m getting cheques from EMI publishing for £50,000, leave him with his two hundred bucks. So the whole relationship was done because I liked the kid’s talent and want to help him out, and enjoy the music I’m making with him. And if he’s sticking by you and coming to you for advice, in a management relationship, to me that’s much more important than getting up and signing this big fat contract, because it doesn’t make any difference. You’re going to get married. You and this person have to care about each other. You can’t just think we’re married now, the paper’s signed. They don’t care. If you’re an asshole, they’ll be the same way. What difference does the paper make? That doesn’t bind the relationship. Yeah, legally it’s important, but you need to have your relationship with that person because you’re going to go through a lot ups, a lot of downs. And when you’re up, they are the greatest thing. “I’m the artist, everybody loves me.” And when they’re down, you are the worst manager. But you’re never the best manager when they’re on top. “It’s all about me, the people love me.” And when they’re down, “Yo, my management is fucked, they’re not doing nothing.” ”Maybe you recorded some crap songs, I’m just the manager.” It’s that kind of job. Toby Laing Is this something you’re going to pursue further or is just something that happened? Are there people coming up in the studio who you think have great talent? Jeremy Harding There might be. But most of the successful management of reggae artists came from guys who were doing everything for the artist. They were the managers, the producers, everything. You talk about Shabba Ranks, Cobra, Patra, that was Clifton “Specialist” Dillon. He was their producer, he was their manager. So he had that control where he was making their records and guiding their careers. Then you have Robert Livingston, who manages Shaggy. He’s a producer, he has his producers, they have their studio, they make the records and they also manage the artist. My thing with Sean is similar. If I don’t make the records, I supervise the records that are being made and I make the decisions as well. It is very difficult to manage the artist if you don’t have anything to do with them creatively, because then they just go off in a direction you can’t manage. To just produce them and make hit records leaves another void, because you have this big hit that’s a smash on the radio, but there’s no follow–up. The record business is about way more than getting your song on the radio. It’s the follow-up, the whole promo, the videos, the imaging, the interviews, the press, everything he has to do to create this artist that people want to buy into. If kids like the song, alright, it’s number one on Hot 97 in New York, on 1 Xtra in the UK. “Great. Search, download.” The only time you have to buy is when you buy into the artists. There’s something about them you like, then I want to buy the album, I want to look at the pictures, I want to read the thing. It’s difficult to think about it separate in our music, because as big as reggae music is, we don’t have that fertile breeding ground for the development of artists. If you’re in the United States you have booking agents, you have publicists, stylists, choreographers, video directors. You have all these people dedicated to the fostering of growth of an artist. You find a girl, you say, “You sing R&B?” Then you have all these people who go, “OK, no problem. I can dress her and make her look like Beyoncé, I’m a stylist.” Here’s the clothes. You have a choreographer, “I can make sure she dances like Christina Milian.” You go to that producer, “I wrote all the songs for Destiny’s Child, for Amerie,” they go like that. You hook it up, it’s all mapped out for you. They can create stars and artists from nothing, easily. Toby Laing [How] do you find their idea of manipulation, say, when you take Sean to the States and they’re putting it out on a big label, maybe they’re asking you to do certain things you don’t want to, manipulating the sound and so on? Jeremy Harding We have certain guidelines by which we do our thing. We have lawyers based in New York, we have stylists, accountants, we have to create our team around Sean for him to step up to that level. If you don’t do it the record company are going to try and make you do it anyway. You’ll get there and it’ll be, “I’m a stylist.” They’ll push something on you and you might look at it, “No, that’s not his image.” So we have our own stylist. “Oh, we have a great photographer.” “No, we have our own photographer, his pictures are done. This is how I want my artist to look.” The label can’t exist without that whole machine to sell those records. Once in a while, yes, you get a great artist that puts out great records and none of that matters. But the machine is geared towards a whole different age. We spent hours and hours doing interviews for websites. Five years ago no one cared about websites. Now it’s, “We’re going to have your album debut on AOL Sessions.” The whole way the web works, this website gets 50 million hits a day, so you need to do the interview. It’s a lot more involved than just making a good song. We always make great songs in Jamaica. They get reggae songs in the club, you always get breakthrough reggae hits but then there’s no follow-up after. “Ah, remember when that reggae guy had that song? That’s wicked.” The industry in Jamaica doesn’t understand how to foster that growth, so you have to know how to get with the program. Toby Laing That’s a good insight into international music business. Would you mind telling us how you work in the studio and what you use? Jeremy Harding When I started off, I had an AKAI S950 rack sampler. I had an Atari with Mastertracks Pro and I had one Korg module for the M1, I think it was an M3R, Tannoy monitors and a little Mackie 16–track mixer. Then Digidesign had a program called Session 8, which was like an 8–track version of Pro Tools with this big interface. Did it have an EQ? I think it had an EQ, but you couldn’t use plugins, it was just eight tracks and you could cut-and-paste the same way. It had a big unit and you could plug the mic in. I used that to make a lot of records, like “Who Am I,” by Beenie Man, that was made on that system. Then I tried using the hard disk recorders. That was a piece of garbage, and I lost a lot music on that thing. It works good until the drive crashes one day for no reason and the whole 80GB drive goes. Now I’m in the studio, I mean success brings the money and you can buy the stuff you you want. So now I have MPC 2000, 2000XL, MPC 4000, MPC 3000, Roland Fantom, Triton, Alesis Ion, Access Virus, Nord Lead, some E-Mu modules, Pro Tools HD system, Reason, Logic, what else? Tons of outboard gear and preamps, like Avalon and Viper tube preamps and API preamps, SSL bus compressor, which is all fine and good. To be honest with you, now it’s more difficult to make music. You have too many choices. You sit in the studio like, “Let me program the drums. Let me use this drum machine. Where was that sound? It was in the Roland. No, there’s some good drums in Reason, oh wait, no, Logic.” It gets confusing, you have so many options and you get caught up in being a techie. I’m a junkie, I love gadgets and electronics and software and laptops. All these things come out, “Oh, a new Pioneer mixer? I need it.” “What do you mean you need it? You don’t even DJ any more.” You get so much into the gear, and you start to afford high-end gear. So now I can buy API pre–amps, because I’ve heard about these things. Now I can buy the Sony C800G microphone that Dr Dre uses for Eminem that costs six grand, because you’re making some money now. You can afford it. At the end of the day you sit down with five mics in front of you, four drum machines, ten keyboards, three pieces of software, all the outboards, you’re crammed in your little studio. And you’re like, “Fuck, how do I make music again?” You get lost. The lesson to be learned is that the gear doesn’t matter, it really doesn’t make a difference. It all comes from your head and your heart. Most of the rhythms out of Jamaica are made on Logic and FruityLoops. Most of the new kids can’t afford a drum machine, but they can afford a PC and they can go on the web and download a cracked version of FruityLoops. And they make records, and all these big dancehall records, like Capleton and this Drop Leaf riddim, these big one-drop reggae records that sound like Sly & Robbie in the studio with the weed, are made by one producer on Logic. Don Corleone, a good friend of mine, he programmed the whole thing on Logic and if he needs a guitar part a guy comes over [imitates guitar playing], he puts it in the sampler, lines it on top of Logic, he does everything. He takes that, drops it into Pro Tools, takes Pro Tools, mixes it up and when you hear it, “Yeah, this is what I’m talking about, this is the real reggae, live bass, not that programmed bullshit.” It’s Logic, dude, relax. That’s how that kid’s working. The gear doesn’t really make any difference in the creation of the music. Recording-wise, you still can’t beat good preamps. I know yesterday Jimmy Douglass was talking about the outboard and the vintage gear and all that. I don’t really subscribe to that. I have plugins that sound great to me. The plugins can do sounds that outboards cannot do. It’s really not practical to be buying every single reverb, costing thousands of dollars and taking up so much space. I love plugins, sure, but I use them both. If I have the outboard gear, I’ll use it. If I have the plugins, I’ll use it if I need this kind of compression. This outboard gear works good, and then the next time I’ll be thinking that plugin sounds wicked because it can do the thing with compression that the whole box cannot do. Altiverb, a lot of these big plugins, Lexicon, it’s at that level where the plugin manufactures are approaching that level. People have that analog [versus] digital debate. A lot of the reason you have that thing in your head about analog sounding better is that the records you listened to when you were growing up and made you love music, they were recorded in that format. That to you is what’s supposed to be a good sound, that’s the emotional connection. You listen to today’s music, “Oh, it’s digital, I don’t hear the tape compression. It doesn’t sound like my old records.” All that is going to pass by because in a generation coming up, a 15-year-old kid is not listening to the sound of tape, he’s growing up listening to Pro Tools. So when he starts making music he won’t have the frame of reference that tape sounded better. Why? It’s non-existent for him. They watch films, they see Star Wars, it’s all digital. So when they watch an old film, “Why does it look so mushy? Clark Gable, I don’t get it.” No, you want explosions, bright colours, surround sound. Your whole reference keeps changing. You can’t sit here and talk about your audio tape, it’s all closed down. You can’t buy the tape. A kid wants to record to audio tape. How? Go buy a tape machine for that much money? Are you mad? Who has that much money? $70,000 for an Atari tape machine? It doesn’t make any practical sense. Old-school engineers will tell you about it, they learnt on that system and I’m happy for them. But I can’t sit here and tell you, “Yeah, the vintage gear’s the best thing. Fuck the plugins, Pro Tools don’t sound good. CD sounds shit, vinyl sounds better.” You have to move along. You can make music on anything, it doesn’t matter what you have. That’s what makes you good, to use what you have and make that music. A guy can go, “Yeah, I’m a producer,” and go to a fancy studio with three other programmers around him, a guy with a Pro Tools rig, an MPC programmer, a guy who’s a whiz at Logic, some wicked keyboard player who’s going to sit down and say, “Yeah, man, it’s my track, I did it.” Versus a little kid with a little controller, FruityLoops, headphones and he’s mapped out his thing. Now, who do you think is the more talented person? It doesn’t make a difference. I have all that gear and sometimes I just turn on one drum machine and use that. Toby Laing So are you in the studio a lot at the moment? Jeremy Harding I’m trying to get back into it, the management takes up a lot of my time, energy and focus. But at the same time I feel like I’m doing something for the greater good, because if you don’t manage the artists well, then making the records almost seems like it’s not going to go anywhere anyway. I have to keep pushing down the doors with the artists. I have to make sure that Sean Paul can sell millions again, to prove to world that we’re here to stay, that reggae music can sell, it can work. Sign these kids, give them record deals, put them on the TV, fly them all over the world, make them do the promo so they can sell the records. So when that happens now, it’s good, now we can go to America because America is thinking, this can sell, this can go on the Elephant Man album, or the Vybz Kartel, or Beenie Man, give them all a shot. So to me it’s more important to make sure it works for him as an artist. Otherwise we’re making the music, selling 5,000 copies of the vinyl. Where’s it going in the long run? Toby Laing That’s an investment in the future. It would be great if you could get back into the studio and keep doing what you’re doing. I’d appreciate that and so would these guys. I think it might be a good idea to see if there’s anyone who wants to ask any questions out there. Audience Member My buddy just came back, he was in vacation in Kingston with his girlfriend. He came back with a big box full of 45s. He just went into the record store, he’s like, “Okay, give me everything that’s hot. Give me what they play in the clubs.” I noticed that there would be like four records with the same label, the same beat, but all different artists spitting on it. Jeremy Harding Right. Audience Member Can you maybe talk a little bit about how that works? Jeremy Harding We have a culture in our music where we have a thing called riddim juggling. Juggling like a circus, riddim juggling, which really refers to when DJs play the records and they play that same track with multiple artists on it. They play a song and they queue one and play the next one and play the next one. One whole five-minute experience really gets you like four or five artists at the same time. The reason for it primarily was an economic reason, because of how much it would take for you to get a track of music done. You say you want to be a producer, but you’re not a musician. You find a guy, you’re like, “Yo, program some drums.” You put it on tape, this is back in tape days. You get a keyboard player, “Yo, play something in for me.” You do this and that. Now you have a three or four-track tape that has cost you the amount of time in the studio, paying studio time and hours and to pay all these musicians, that you can’t make back enough by just making one song on this one track. They go in the studio, you have 24-track tape. That might fill up like 10 tracks with music. They’re looking at it like, “Well, you know, I have 14 more tracks on the tape.” They go and they get 14 artists. They mix the song and they push up this fader, that’s that vocal and they run it off. They bring that down and they push up the next fader and then that’s that artist. It all lives on one 24-track master. Every fader is a different artist. The reason was just an economic reason because you spend so much time and energy and money to put together this project that the sale of one record could never make back the money when you’re selling 5,000 copies in Jamaica, whatever. It’s impossible. You have to have 14 artists on it. Now you’re selling upwards of 50,000 copies, which would cover the cost. That phenomenon they started to call juggling the riddim track. The DJs play the music like that. It was an experience where it was like a community-based thing. If you had this riddim, all these different artists would give it their different version of the song that they think should go on the riddim track. So as you said, he’s going to come back with all these 45s and it’s the same label because the it’s same producer. It’s him with his thing. You’re lucky you only got five. Usually it’s like 14, 20 on the same riddim track. It becomes such a culture of how they play the music. It was positive in many ways. That would give a young artist a chance and opportunity to be able to record. If I was a producer and had my tape, or whatever, and I recorded all the big artists I wanted to get, I had Cobra, Buju Banton, Beenie Man or Ninja Man, whoever you had, then there’s this little kid that nobody knows but you say, “All right, I’ll give you a shot. You have a track, go.” Right? He got one track. He did his best now to do his song on this one. No double track and chorus and harmony, fuck that. You got one track. He has his shot. That small artist would feel like, “OK, I’m on the same riddim track as these big artists. When the guys get in the club now and they’re going to play the big artists, maybe they’ll play my song. Now they listened to 30 seconds of my song. If they can mix it in with the big artist song I’ll get a little bit of shine.” In that way it was very useful for the younger artists. The producers felt good, like, “OK, now I can make back my money. If I make 14 songs on this riddim track, I have 14 separate records to sell. Maybe I can get three or four hits, or five hits, or six hits.” The foreign companies come along and they want to license the project and they license the whole CD: “Give me all 14 tracks, put it on a CD." Now they’re making these kind of production albums. The focus for us in Jamaica, or the producer and musicians, it don’t really matter to us if it’s on the same riddim track. They care about what the artist is doing on a track. You didn’t really have that marriage of, like, this track is for this artist. No, they can say it’s just like a riddim. It’s just a track. It’s really about what the artist is doing. That’s sort of why the culture of that whole thing takes place. Even in recent times, Sean Paul had a big number one record with “Get Busy,” if you know that song. Wayne Wonder had a song on the same riddim track. Lumidee had a song on the same riddim track, you understand? Afterwards you had like Nina Sky and Pitbull and Mister Vegas and they all had songs on this same dancehall riddim track. It still kind of happens. In hip-hop it happens once in a while. You get a track that has “Smiles” and “Southstar” and it has like Ja Rule and Ashanti and it’s the same riddim track, you know what I mean? If you go back into hip-hop and talk about all those Roxanne records, they were all on that same beat. It was like the Real Roxanne, Roxanne this, Roxanne that, Roxanne’s Revenge. They were all cut on the same. They had a certain amount of that culture in some of the stuff that they were doing as well. We have never really let go of it though. As I said, it started off really as just economic reasons. It’s just trying to make back your money. Toby Laing It does work in the dance as well though, that’s the thing. You can listen to one riddim, and when you’re spinning the records, it can work for an hour. Jeremy Harding Right. Because if you think about it you’re not playing three minutes and 30 seconds of every song, so you’re playing a song, chorus, verse, chorus. By the time you’re into five or six minutes of time you heard five artists so it all gets very compressed. It doesn’t really feel like, “Oh fuck, I’m listening to the same thing for half an hour.” No, because it’s really five or six minutes a time where you got so many artists in there. You know what I mean? Audience Member Is there a competitive element among singers to see who can do the best version on one riddim? Jeremy Harding Definitely. Very, very competitive. You have some artists who’ll wait until a bunch of guys record a song to see the caliber. People like Bounty Killer, Beenie Man, those guys. You have a track, they don’t come in at first to record nothing. They’ll say, “Go ahead,” and wait. And they’ll listen to the radio and say, “Oh, that’s what that artist is doing.” Then they go write their song, they’ll try to write a better song than all of them. So it’s very, very competitive that way. Some guys don’t care, like Capleton, Elephant Man, these guys, they don’t care, it doesn’t matter. Riddim, record, headphones, spit. Some of them are a lot more calculating and they want to make sure this thing has a certain class, is at a certain level, so if you have a riddim track and you only have these little unknown artists on it, they don’t want to put their song on that riddim track because what kind of company is that to be in? They want to be on a riddim with the big artists, so it is very tactical this whole game of who records what track, because they’re all fighting for the same stage shows and the same bookings and the same dubplates. Kids will come all the way from Japan and they want exclusive reggae dubplates, they want specials. “I have a soundsystem. Here, it’s in the paper.” And the guy’s going to read it and cut an exclusive song for that soundsystem. So the kid from Japan comes and he’s got $10,000 dollars and he’s going to spend it. So you as an artist, you better make sure that your song on that collection, that riddim, is the baddest song so he’ll want you do an exclusive version for them. So you can’t take it lightly, like, “We’re all friends and we’re all one big happy family and we’re all in the dancehall community, we’re Jamaicans, everybody hug.” Nah, fuck that, you don’t have the hot song, you won’t get the dubplate and make a lot of money, and you won’t get the stage show, or you won’t get top billing on the show. “Your song wasn’t that big, you can come on at like ten o’ clock at night. Your song was huge, we’re saving you till three in the morning. How much money do you want?” So, very, very competitive. Audience member With the specials, how accessible are the artists for doing that and how much does it cost? Jeremy Harding Specials can cost anywhere between, depending on the artist, like an artist you really care about, maybe $200 all the way to $1,000, $1,500 per song. Usually, a lot of guys will come to Jamaica and hunt them down, go to the studio and get the specials done. Nowadays everybody has laptops and Roland VS880 machine, you can cut specials anywhere, hotel rooms, it doesn’t matter. Before you had to go the dub studio and pay the money, and have the lacquer plate and have the guy do the thing and it’s cutting at the same time, and you couldn’t fuck up, and you go [mimics blowing on dubplate]. That’s why you call it dubplates, because of the acetate lacquer that you use to press the mother stampers to make records. But they just take that acetate lacquer, that big heavy thick thing, and play that, that’ll be the dubplate. But we’re in modern times, so it’s Pioneer CDJ, it’s all about Roland VS880 CD, that’s your new dubplate. But they’ll either get the artists that way, or if the artist is going on tour, say he’s going to Seattle and you have a guy in Seattle, they’ll find out where the artists are, go to the hotel and get the dubplates from them. Or they have guys in Jamaica who know artists who’ll go and beg them: “Listen, there is a friend of mine that has a soundsystem. Could you do something for them?” And they’ll do the transaction and get back the money. You have a soundsystem, you might be friendly with another soundsystem in Jamaica and they’ll do you a favor. So, yeah, anywhere between $200 and $1,500. I’m not going to hide, most successful soundsystems are run by drug money, straight up. Nobody else can afford to pay that. Drug dealers who have soundsystems playing out, they can afford that. I’ve seen guys cut dubplates for one party, one time, with that person’s name in it. That record’s going to be played once, ever. It can never be played again. You come and cut a dubplate, say Bounty Killer. [imitates Bounty Killer’s voice] “Hey yo, king of these, biggest sound around town, bass odyssey, we’re going to kill you tonight, in New York, run the track.” And he’s saying it on the record. It’s for that dance, that particular night, it can never be played again and they pay Bounty Killer $1,500 for that. But that’s about soundsystem dominance, so when they get to the club it’s, “My sound is the biggest sound, I can afford to make a record with your name on it just to kill you tonight. I can play it once. I can take it off and it’s no use, but that’s how big I am.” It’s soundsystem dominance, but the dubplate thing, these guys take it seriously. It’s a whole subculture unto itself, it doesn’t have anything to do with what I do with managing Sean Paul and producing beats in the studio. In the same way that turntablist culture has split off from hip-hop. DJ culture and turntablist culture doesn’t have anything to do with what 50 Cent’s doing or Jay-Z’s doing. This is turntablists doing culture stuff, making beat CDs, making scratch things, doing DMC competitions, winning them, it’s a whole next discipline. The soundsystem thing in Jamaica, too, the clashing of the sounds, a whole other discipline. Nothing to do with us making records and the music. Audience member When you are producing a riddim do you work specifically on each song for each artist, or do you do it and then give it to the studio and then just run all the tunes? Jeremy Harding Some guys work differently. I can’t write DJ songs, I can’t write songs like that. I can make the rhythms, but I can’t think like them, I can’t write like them. So I will just create the track and to me, I don’t create the track. You create the lyrics and then I’ll produce the record from there. “I like that, I don’t like that. Do the melody this way. How about using that melody?” That’s how I work. Audience member And do you play with the arrangement after the vocal is recorded? Jeremy Harding Not usually. It depends. If it’s my artist, if it’s Sean Paul, then yeah. But for someone else, no, because then you start going haywire, everybody’s going to want to do something different. You’re going to have keep changing the whole riddim every two seconds. Take out this keyboard part, put in that part, replay this part and it goes all over the place. Some guys now will do a basic rhythm track, let the guys record their song and they might play a keyboard line with a melody to follow what the artist does. Some producers are writers who’ll actually create the riddim and have the song already written, guys like Dave Kelly and Tony Kelly. Those guys are real writers of music and have all the hits. That’s why they’re so successful. They’re writing the songs as well as the riddims, then saying, “This one will be good for Beenie Man.” Audience member The big tune on that riddim will be one that they wrote? Jeremy Harding Yeah, yeah. All of them, anything you hear from Dave Kelly, he writes all those songs. A lot of artists, when they’re on that that label, he writes. Some people work differently, they write songs for the artists, have ideas and sketch them out. Others like me, I just do the track. They’ll come with a song, and if I don’t like it, I’ll tell them to alter it. But I don’t consider myself enough of a writer of lyrics to pretend I can sit down and write a song for these guys. Depends how it works. Some people are even less hands-on than that. They’ll make a track and then give it to the artist, and the artists will go, “I have Digi02 Pro Tools at my house,” and they go and do it. But I don’t subscribe to that at all because that’s not producing. Fuck that. Give them the thing and they go off and do it and come back. Producing what? That’s not production, you made the beat. You had nothing to do with the recording of that record. I don’t like that personally but that’s what some people do. Audience member I know you’re not a part of the soundsystem culture, but what do you feel about a German sound winning the world clash now? Jeremy Harding It’s fantastic. That just goes to show you how much the culture is spreading. That’s amazing. From my perspective that’s great, because I’m trying to manage an artist and make records to reach people internationally. Maybe some people in Jamaica will be like, “That’s fucked up. How can a German sound win the soundclash? That’s bullshit.” But the soundsystem thing, the people decide. If you play in a hall that is 90% Jamaicans anyway, and they decide that the German soundsystem played best, who are you to talk? German sound wins. Canadian sound wins sometimes, Japanese sounds. Japanese kids playing reggae is tripped out. Mighty Crown and those guys. They’re good and they can’t speak English, but they speak Jamaican patois and that’s what’s amazing to me. They come to Jamaica these kids, and not just Mighty Crown, and you’ll say, “How are you doing, you guys going out tonight?” And they’ll look at you and say, “Wha’? Me no unnerstan’.” “Wha’ gwan, you a go to club tonight?” “Yeah, man. Me a go to club tonight, man.” And it’s so weird, I met these chicks from Tokyo, and you know those travel books, the translation books? I swear to god, Japanese to Jamaican patois. I don’t know who makes the book. The girl had the book and she says, “Hold on.” And looks in the book and then says, “Yeah man, ya dun no me wan’ go tonight.” And she’s reading and I say, “Let me see that book.” Japanese–English–Jamaican patois, it’s her travel guide and she’s in Jamaica and her English sucks. You know what I mean? We’re an English-speaking country. I have my accent and we have our little slang, our patois, but it’s English, I’m talking English all the time. They don’t get it. Mighty Crown and these Japanese kids, they get on the mic, “Yo, you dun no, big up all the massive in the ‘ouse. Yo, come down.” And they can’t speak regular English and you’re like, “Yo, you’re students of the culture. That’s amazing, you take on language, everything, and you can play a soundsystem.” How can you not respect that? Come on. Gentleman from Germany, he’s an amazing reggae artist, period. I don’t care where you come from or what color your skin is, the man is a tough artist. He comes and records for my friend [Don Corleone’s big smash record [starts singing]. You know what I’m saying? He plays in a dance in Jamaica, the place goes wild, mash up. Those guys are students of the music, of Luciano and Sizzla, and practice [their] craft. And he’s not trying to be fake. He don’t have no dreadlocks, he’s not trying to look like nothing. He just has his head shaved bald, and a little beard, dressed like a normal kid and he really loves his music. Any time any culture outside Jamaica do it, Jamaica embraces them. They embrace Snow from Canada, they embrace Gentleman. They embrace all of these guys from the soundsystem because they’re showing something. “We really like your culture and we’re into your music. We’re not here posing or pretending to get something out of it.” What is there to get out of reggae music? What are you talking about? I’m barely able to sell any records. You have to rely on dubplates from drug dealers to make any money. It’s not like when guys say, “I want to be a rapper because I want to get on MTV and have a chain,” and all that dumb shit. Because we don’t have that. When you come into our music it’s because you really love our music. You’re making a pilgrimage to Jamaica to learn about the music, to get involved, and they will accept you. “Yeah man, my bredren from Germany, him a wicked selector.” And they work with you. And they love you because you love their thing. So it’s all good, the soundsystems just keep spreading the music more and more. If I can have a German soundsystem playing my music across Germany and Europe, playing the records that I make, that’s what I need. I need a New Zealand soundsystem playing the records that I make. UK, South America, all over the place. It can only help my music, so I can sell records and my artists can tour and go all over the whole world. Sean Paul had a show three months ago in Madagascar. How the hell you get to go places like that in the world based on music? 50 Cent doesn’t do a show in Madagascar, neither does Jay-Z or Mariah Carey, but we do. So that whole cultural exchange is brilliant. Some of the places Sean has been to he didn’t even know where to find it on the map. “I don’t know, where is that? Here? There’s a show?” “Yeah. Someone’s paying you to go and perform there?” “You’re going to Poland, why?” “My record’s number three.” How the fuck can a Jamaican artist have the number three record in Poland? It’s bizarre to me. But you’re spreading music and they love it. It’s fantastic, man. Audience Member Earlier when you started talking you referenced a lot of different music that’s not directly connected to reggae and influenced you, like Nitzer Ebb and house and whatever. And it feels to me like the best riddims are always ones that are somewhat divergent from the regular patterns, like rhythm-wise and bassline-wise. To what extent do you think a producer has to be music-savvy person and understand about completely different styles in order to make the next big riddim and make it unexpected and make it go somewhere else no one else is going? Jeremy Harding I mean I think it’s very important, me personally, because I’m a lover of music, you understand? Not just reggae music or dance music. I love music. You listen to all kinds of music throughout your life and it influences how you want to make music. You get what I’m saying? I mean, I’ve got my hard rock guitar stuff or whatever and at the same time I can go and listen to soft R&B music, whatever. When I was a kid my dad would listen to classical music. Understand? I grew up listening to classical music. I think all influences are good. I don’t think you should be able to close yourself off. People have this impression, like, “I’m a hip-hop head so I listen to hip-hop because I’m keeping it real and like, fuck that soft shit.” That’s garbage. You understand what I’m saying? People think that to try and prove something that they must listen to only this kind of music or only listen to only that kind of music. It doesn’t make any sense. You love music so you listen to all various influences and types of music. I think it’s very important because it makes your whole spectrum very broad. If you consciously try and take the music to put in, that’s one way of doing it, but sometimes subconsciously it will just come into it when you are making your music. You don’t realize it that you are playing some kind of melody and your friend will look at you like, “Yo, that kind of sounds like a little Spanish-y jazz type guitar. How come?” And you’re like, “I don’t know.” It doesn’t occur to you. You know what I mean, but you actually listen to that music. You are a fan of music. Understand. It can only make you better. Being able to play an instrument. I’ve been producing music for years. I recently got back into playing my guitar. I had some reggae artist come by the studio last year and I’m fucking around on the guitar playing like a Les Paul and running some scale and they’re like, “You can play guitar?” I’m like, “Yeah.” That’s wicked. I didn’t know you were a real musician.” “What do you mean I’m a real musician? What the fuck?” Yo, I’ve been making records since like ‘93, ‘94 you know, but all of a sudden I’m now a real musician because they saw me playing a guitar. So all the records I’ve been making with all my keyboards and drum machine, I never qualified in their head as being a real musician. “Turntable? You’re not a real musician. You’re scratching records. Oh, you can play guitar. Now you are a real musician.” You know what I’m saying? Impressions that people have. You’re shocked. Jamie Foxx is a big actor and then he goes sings with Kanye and everybody’s like, “Oh, Jamie Foxx can sing. He can play piano.” Like, all of a sudden. He could always do it, but he was trying to be an actor. You know what I’m saying? He used to do the soundtracks for his [films], nobody cared. He was an actor, but he of course is a musician. It all depends on your perspective, so the more things that you can learn… let me tell you something. It can only make you way more versatile as a DJ as a producer, as an engineer, like Jimmy [Douglass] was saying yesterday. He is an engineer. He can play a bass. He can play guitar. He can sing a little bit because part of his job when he’s making music... Artists come into my studio and start with something, I’d be like, “No, hold on. Do it this way.” “You can sing?” Dude, I make music. I can do it. Yeah, I’m not the greatest singer or the greatest guitar player or the greatest DJ, but I’ve found a way to take all those things to do what I need to do, so the more influences that you have, you know what I mean? Don’t be shy. You want to go join a choir right now? Go and join it. Don’t make your friends say, “Oh, what kind of sissy thing is that? You’re in a choir. You’re supposed to be this big producer.” No. Fuck that. Go learn to sing. It’s going to help you. You understand? Learn an instrument, guitar, piano, fucking saxophone, anything at all. Go and work with hip-hop producers like the Neptunes. Them guys are multi-talented, you know. Work with them, like Pharrell and them guys. Believe you me, instruments, keyboard, they’re sick. Guitar, saxophone, they can play all the shit. Drums, they actually can play. Not because they are hip-hop guys making beats and stuff. They’re actual musicians. They can sing. You know what I mean? It really, really helps. So all them musical influences that I’ve taken and used to make music, and you can use it in a capacity. It makes you more versatile. You don’t know where the road is going to take you because, I’m telling you, I thought I was going to be a guitarist. Swore to God I was going to be a guitar player and then I was going to be a DJ. You understand what I’m saying? Now I end up being a reggae music producer and manager. You don’t know where the path is going to take you and all these influences helped you all along the way. You have to know about computers. Everybody in Kingston comes to me to fix their Mac. All these kids with Pro Tools, Steely & Cleevie, they all come to me. “Jeremy is the guy, he knows about Macintosh. Oh, my shit crashed.” I know how to do it because I’ve taken an interest in learning about the tools which I have, so I’m saying to myself, “OK, at any given time I could go back and play on a radio station. I could work for a record company because I’m experienced in managing artists and fighting with the fucking record company for four years.” Right? I know what they think and how they work. I could be a Pro Tools engineer. You understand what I’m saying? I could just program beats. You have so many other talents that you know that you could end up in different situations, so you never know what the situation is going to drop yourself into. You guys are all here. You’re DJs, you’re producers, you’re making music, you have your own dreams and ideas of what you think you want to do in the business. You never know what you are going to end up doing. You understand what I’m saying? To be so versatile. To be in any situation where... I keep referencing Jimmy yesterday. He had a great talk. He’s going to work with Jimmy Page. How can you do that? You have to know something about rap music and guitar playing. This guy’s like a guy who’s trying to be a producer, ends up being an engineer at Atlantic Records and is now recording something with Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin, because the approach is so wide, so you know, “Oh, guitar. I understand that. Les Paul. No problem. What are you trying to do? Solos. Let me hear it. OK, let’s try this.” He can do it because he has the knowledge, and that’s all influences of music that you listen to all the while. Embrace it all. All music is one thing. Music is just one whole thing. Yeah, OK, these guys are from this area and they are called rap and we are from here and we call it dancehall and some guys make this and they call it dance music and whatever. To me it’s the same. It’s just one. It’s just music. You know? Audience Member Stupid question probably, but where is Jamaican music going next? Jeremy Harding Where is it going? Audience Member Yeah. Jeremy Harding Well, I wish someone would tell me so I could know what to do. I don’t know. That’s a hard question, where is Jamaican music going next? I don’t know. Sometimes you think that with the success of a few international acts that it’s going to blow up. I don’t know. I think the influence of the music is spreading a lot. We have a lot more reggae in a lot more American music and music from around the world. People have a lot more... Hip-hop is at the point right now where everything can be hip-hop, like every beat can program and have a hip-hop feel to it that doesn’t really... Every commercial on TV has like a hip-hop beat or something. It changes. I think dancehall has reached a point where I can get like R. Kelly records and hear it and be like, “That’s dancehall, you can’t trick me, that ain’t R&B, that’s a dancehall beat, R. Kelly.” You know what I’m saying? [sings] It’s dancehall. Christina Milian, dancehall. Beyoncé. You hear so much influences in so much of the music. Certain rock groups do the certain things, and it’s spreading that way. Jamaican music itself, where it’s going, I don’t know, that’s a very hard question. I guess the whole idea is that this new generation, we have our hands on the steering wheel. You understand? It’s not so much about where is it going and we’ll follow it. No, we can take it to them. It’s this generation right now, these kids here playing the music, me trying to manage the actors. It’s up to me, because the baton has been passed. I love Sly and Robbie, they’re legends, and they did a great job, but the baton is passed. It ain’t up to Sly and Robbie no more to make this happen, or Black Uhuru, or Shabba Ranks, or the Wailers, or Bob Marley, or none of these people. It’s not up to them. No, it’s up to this generation. They have done their work and said, “We have done it, take this and build. This is a foundation. You guys carry it where you want to go.” You get mixed up with hip-hop, go ahead. Dance music, what you want to do? It’s your choice how you’re going to deal with it now, we’re good. Same with Sinead O’Connor, like on late night TV, [Sy & Robbie] backing her up. They’re cool, them guys nice, plenty Grammys, money. They’re good, they’re named legends, you can’t take that away from them. They’ve done their thing, understand? So we’re trying to build our new thing right now. Where is it going? I don’t know. We have to carry it there. So we’re still trying to figure it out ‘cause there’s no map. It’s all uncharted territory so we’re just trying to figure it out as we go along. Audience Member I know a little bit about the existence of riddims and stuff but maybe you can help me out from a Kingston point of view. What is the difference between reggae, dancehall, raggamuffin – do people in Jamaica make a real difference between these words, or is it just a label? Jeremy Harding Between the words? To us everything is reggae. It’s just one music, it’s reggae music. Dancehall specifically referred to a place. The dance hall, the place where they played the reggae music. Understand? So where the party is being kept, it is being kept at that dance hall. You get me? And they started calling it dancehall music and created a subgenre. For us, it’s just still reggae. The definition to us is just reggae music straight up. We make the friendship between an uptempo dancehall track and a downtempo one. We’ll call a downtempo one “one drop” or a “culture riddim.” Then we call an uptempo one dancehall, or you used to call it bashment but you don’t use that word again. “Jump up riddim,” they say that now. You say, “Yeah man, that’s a jump up riddim, it sounds nice.” [imitates riddim] A one drop is kind of like... [imitates riddim] A slow thing. We call it that, but to us it’s just reggae. We don’t really title it very different than that. People keep trying to make a distinction but I don’t know, what passes for rock nowadays don’t have nothing to do with fucking Elvis and Chuck Berry and that shit. Linkin Park and Chuck Berry? It’s worlds apart [laughter] but you still call it rock music though. It’s rock, right? So then why is it you think that if it doesn’t sound like Bob Marley it can’t be reggae, it must have a different name? Not all music progresses the same way. Audience Member I’m not in need of a real labeling, I was just wondering because you’re from Jamaica, you’re from the streets of Kingston, so maybe you could help us out. It was just a question. Jeremy Harding It’s all reggae to us. We’re not trying to divide it up or nothing like that. We know the difference between a jump up and a one drop and all of that but we don’t really make that distinction. The problem happens when outside of Jamaica people want to say, “You’re not reggae, you don’t sound like Bob Marley so it can’t be reggae. You’re dancehall, it’s something that’s close to hip-hop.” Who made you decide what you can tell me my music sounds like. What the fuck are you talking about? This is reggae. Do you understand what I’m saying? So we don’t really make that distinction, you understand? Why should the distinction even be there? It doesn’t really make sense to me what’s different. The process is the same. If you have an artist like Sizzla or Luciano, they record on the same jump up riddims and they record on the one drop, more traditional sounding riddims. Where does that really put them? They’re a dancehall artist? What’s Buju Banton? He’s a reggae artist, he’s not dancehall... They do all styles. So it’s pointless for us to try and divide it. To us it’s just reggae. The evolution of reggae sure, we call it dancehall as a young catchphrase for it. It’s still just reggae. Audience Member A lot the recent big riddims were going back to the roots, the Drop Leaf, Hard Times, Seasons riddims. Do you think that’s the new… trend? I wouldn’t call it trend because I think they’re all good. Jeremy Harding It gets popular right now. I think the people sometimes just want a break and they want to put their minds somewhere else. You have a lot of fast, uptempo, clubby sounding reggae or dancehall music not really talking about much. Talking about dancing or dance moves in the club and stuff like that. I think after a while people just kind of turn... That music is always there. Sometimes it’s not as popular but those artists always exist and they’re always there. It’s not really like them guys that is making that one song now and again. Yeah, it got very trendy recently to listen back to a lot of that downtempo, one drop stuff. It was embraced very well across the world as well. It suits what people’s traditional thinking of what reggae should sound like to them, and they really embrace it. By the same token, what are we really talking about here? The world embraces it but by the same token my artist doesn’t do music like that necessarily and I can sell lots of records across the world. He’s popular and people like him the same way. It doesn’t really prove that any one form or any one style is no better or no better embraced by anybody. It’s just what they feel to do. I know the kid that produces that music, Don Corleone, he’s a good friend of mine. He just got sick of making that uptempo shit. Him personally, he just got bored. He just say, “Yo I’m going to make a one drop yah know, fuck it.” He just made something slow and nice. To us it’s like old R&B music, put it that way. Like how hip-hop has R&B as the softer side of the black urban music. That one drop reggae sound in slow tempo stuff is like our R&B listening. When we don’t want to be into the hardcore, Bounty Killer, Vybz Kartel… That’s how we kind of see it. As our cool down, as our chill music to listen to. Inside the box of reggae it’s our down-time music. Audience Member Is it true that there’s a hatred for homosexuals in Jamaica? Jeremy Harding Jamaican culture... Audience member Maybe it’s a cliché? Jeremy Harding No, no, no, I’ll address it. Jamaican culture has a very strong sense of homophobia in the culture. I don’t want to pretend to tell you what the root of it is. There’s a lot of sexual repression in Caribbean countries. They also have a big problem with oral sex, for example. They see it as a demeaning act. A guy cannot go down on a girl, it is a demeaning act. It’s wrong, it’s evil, it’s dirty, it’s nasty. And homosexuality comes under that catalogue of those sexual acts. People have told me that the [anti-]oral sex phenomenon is to do with slaves and slave masters forcing slaves to perform sexual acts on them. I don’t know how far it goes. But yeah, as a culture they’re extremely homophobic. It manifests itself in the music. You do have a gay community in Kingston, just like you anywhere in the world. My perspective is different. I grew up abroad and played house music in clubs, I don’t have time to be prejudiced against gay people. It’s bullshit to me, and there are a few people who might think that way too. But by and large the musical community, because it’s something that is inbred in the society, especially in the ghetto, they play on that a lot. You’ll have an artist that doesn’t have a hit song, he’s playing on stage and the crowd isn’t responding, he plays on the homophobia of the audience. “Yo, everyone who don’t like batty man put two hands in the air.” “Yeah, we don’t like them.” So they play on that so the artist gets some reaction. “Oh fuck, that works.” So if he keeps making records like that then they can’t deny the records, because if they deny the record that’s like them admitting that they’re gay. You see how it works? They go through this bullshit, it’s garbage. They’re homophobic but their favorite designer is Versace. It doesn’t make any sense. They embrace so many things around them that are part of gay culture or might be created by gays. But then they go, “Yo star, bun out.” But they do it because they get a reaction from the people so they keep making these records. Now, with the backlash, what happens is this. They used to make records that used the words figuratively. When you hear a soundsystem record that says, “Killa soundboy,” they meant kill him with music. When they started making these records it wasn’t only homophobia – somebody who’s a thief has the same resentment toward him. It’s like a whole list of rules. If you do oral sex that’s a no-no. If you are gay, that’s a no-no. If you are a thief, that’s a no-no. A guy can be a murderer and get more respect than a thief. They’ll go, “Yeah man, respect man, bad man, gangster, kill nuff yout.” If you’re a thief, “Yo, bloodclaat thief.” They hate you. They have that kind of village justice. They catch a thief and they beat him to death. The police come and he’s dead in the middle of the road. Why? “Oh, he did steal two orange from there.” They hate it, and they have that mob violence mentality. So the whole homophobic thing, they started to take it past the figurative speech and make it so literal, you have “bun a batty man,” “bun” meaning fire and “batty man” meaning gay. No, they started to [become], “Chop them up, hang them up, kill them, kill them with an AK.” That’s when the gay rights groups start saying, “What are you doing? You can’t make records like this. You’re advocating violence towards a group of people.” “No, we just mean it figuratively.” “Dude, you’re saying hang them, shoot them with the AK in the middle of the head. You’re giving instructions.” This is not figurative speech anymore, like, “Yeah, we just don’t like them so we’re saying throw the fire on them.” You take it to a next level. And they have every right to protest it. The thing in Jamaica is that the artists are trying to make it an issue of freedom of speech, that they can do whatever they want to do. Dude, you’re advocating violence. They’re not saying you must embrace the lifestyle. But the violence is wrong. You want to make a record saying, “I don’t agree with the gay lifestyle, I’ll stick to the girls.” That’s fine. But when you’re telling people how to kill people? Now you’re advocating violence, that’s when it’s getting ridiculous. “So you know what? We’re going to protest every show. You’re not going to get your visas. You can’t come and perform here because you’re inciting violence against a group of people.” Some artists view it as a waste of time, why bother making these records anymore? Everybody knows Jamaica is a very homophobic society, which probably means you have a very large gay community there struggling to get out, which is why everyone’s so fucking paranoid about it. Every little thing, if a guy says to you, “Yo, nice shirt.” “You a faggot?” “No, I’m just telling you your shirt’s nice. Calm down.” So clearly you have problems with your own sexuality, or why do these things offend you so much? “Yo, it’s a batty man stance. Why sit so close to me on the couch?” It’s a mentality. So they’ve been trying to encourage these artists to listen. “You know what? For the sake of your hardcore ghetto credibility, I know you’re never going to get up and say homophobia is rubbish, but you don’t have to make these songs about killing other people. That don’t make no fucking sense. And if the only way you’re going to learn is if we take it our of your pocket, then that’s what we’re going to have to do. So a lot of them say, “OK, fuck it, we won’t discuss that topic.” They might have their own personal viewpoint about it, that’s just your personal view, but advocating violence, that’s wrong. I don’t care, they know the position and they know the point and they’re only doing it because they cannot be creative enough to make other songs for people to like. So you’re trying to make a song that must get instant approval because you’re praying on the homophobic nature of the audience, They have to like the record. They can’t say, “I don’t like that record.” “Why, are you gay? Why don’t you like the record? We don’t like gays, remember? So we love that record.” And they play on that fact and it’s a cop out. It’s stupid. We don’t need to make records like that anymore. Toby Laing That was a good explanation for that phenomenon. And thank you very much for coming in today. Appreciate it.

Kirk Degiorgio
The cornerstone and pioneer of UK techno, Kirk DeGiorgio has been tirelessly delivering the original message of Detroit techno, born out of a city renowned for its soul music and its factories. In this lecture at the 2005 Red Bull Music Academy, Kirk takes us on his journey of discovery: Listening to his aunt’s soul records, reading Echoes, working in record shops, taking a trip to Chicago and finally arriving at the Metroplex hub in Detroit, learning how Derrick May, Shake Shakir and Juan Atkins made seminal Detroit soul music with synths and drum machines. From pause-button mixtapes to the impact technology has had on music and club culture, Kirk bridges the gap from West End Boogie to Ableton Live.
Hosted by Kirk Degiorgio I’m Kirk Degiorgio. I don’t know how many of you out there know who I am. I’m kind of mainly known as a techno producer from the UK, but I’ve dabbled in a couple of different genres. My main pseudonym is As One, I’ve done albums for Mo’ Wax, Ubiquity, Versatile. I’ve done albums as Future/Past for R&S and a few other labels, and I’ve done music under my own name for the New Religion label. You might have seen those names around. That’s who I am. Benji B How’s the rehearsals going for tomorrow night? Kirk Degiorgio The rehearsals are going fine. I’m using this laptop, so he’s got to come and fix it ‘cause I’m using it tomorrow. I don’t know what you’ve done to it! But yeah, it’s the kind of thing that’s sending chills down my spine whenever I'm in the rehearsal and I hear what those arrangers have done with a couple of my compositions. Benji B Have you ever been in a situation like that before? Have you ever had an experience like that, hearing someone interpret your music? Kirk Degiorgio Only once before, which was equally as emotional actually. I did a co-write with Fela Kuti’s drummer Tony Allen, and he performed it live in Paris and for me that was a bit of a head trip as well. Only once before, but never on this scale. Benji B So, for those people that aren’t familiar with your music, obviously your influences reach far and wide, as we’re about to find out. But musically as a producer, how would you best describe the music you make? Kirk Degiorgio I would say it’s pretty eclectic. You can’t really categorize it easily, but it’s soulful electronic music. But sometimes it’s not even electronic, so, uh... It’s just music. It’s really hard for me to categorize my style, and I think the record stores have a problem with where to put my albums, usually, as well. Benji B Do you find that’s a problem, being someone who produces electronic music under various different styles? Do you feel it would be easier if you did have a category? Kirk Degiorgio It would be easier for the record shops to sell it, but as an artist it’s great because I can keep people guessing, no one’s going to have any preconceived ideas about what my albums are going to be like, because it could be anything. So artistically, which is what my main interest is, it’s an advantage. Whereas a marketing and promotion and that kind of thing, it’s probably a disadvantage. Benji B So, let’s talk about some corner stones in your musical influences, because I know that basically makes you who you are, musically, and you wanted to touch on that. Kirk Degiorgio Yeah. The big thing that happened to me... I don’t know how young you guys and girls were when you first had that revelation about music, but it happened to me when I was 11 years old. I don’t really remember knowing anything about music or caring about music until I was 11 years old, when I used to go and visit my aunt, in London, I lived about an hour away. She used to go to these soul clubs in London. And just the fact that she used to come in late and talk about these great nights where everyone had a great time... I was 11, and I used to just think, “Wow, I can’t wait to go and do what she does.” And I used to hear music coming out of her bedroom when she was getting ready to go out or the next day or whatever, and it was all music that I’d never heard before in my life. You didn’t hear the music on television, didn't hear it on the radio. And one day she just kinda grew up and grew out of it and in 1979 she gave me a stack of 7”s about this tall [shows stack size with his hands], and I used to play them on my mum’s record player. And they were things like James Brown, Sly Stone, Earth, Wind & Fire, Kool & The Gang, it was all kind of quite mainstream, commercial black music that had been successful in the clubs in England. Benji B And where were you living at this point? Kirk Degiorgio I was living in Ipswich. I was born in London, but after about four years my mum wanted to bring me up in a more rural environment, so we went out to Ipswich. Benji B And how did that affect what access you had to music? Kirk Degiorgio Luckily, Ipswich is still within range of the London radio shows. Which is incredibly lucky, because I think one of the main reasons and influences on people’s taste in music when they’re young is what they can hear at home on the radio. Ipswich is only 60 miles from London, so I could just about pick up the radio stations of London. And also, there was a lot of early pirate stations around Essex and Kent and they were sort of pure soul stations. So I started reading magazines like Blues & Soul and Echoes, and just being able to see the same artists that my aunt had given me, and then I used to read about the radio shows in the listings and I used to tune. And then I used to buy those little C-90 cassette things, and my mum gave me a little tape deck that had an external microphone, and I used to put the microphone right up to the radio the speaker and pray that she didn’t go, “Kirk, your dinner’s ready,” or whatever while a song was playing. I used to tape all those radio shows, for two or three years. Benji B I’m from London, too, so we're lucky to have access to that pirate radio. Can you just fill people in on the spectrum of music that you might hear across the dial on any given weekend? Kirk Degiorgio Yeah, it was mainly American soul and disco and boogie, what we call boogie in the UK. I don’t know if you’ve heard of the DJs: Robbie Vincent, there's Chris Hills, and Froggy...he was a great, great underground DJ, still going today. They had the shows. Greg Edwards, he was an American but he’d come to England, and he had a show on Capital Radio and they used to just play things like this… (music: Skyy – “First Time Around”) Kirk Degiorgio ...you know, joining all the dots with all the different productions and the names that people went under. Maybe a year later, I used to save my dinner money and buy some 7”s. But I couldn’t afford 12”s of these things. They’re American imports, so you couldn’t really find them that well in Ipswich. We had one import store. Benji B And what else in that period was there, because I think it’s the range of music that’s the key to your musical DNA, isn’t it? Kirk Degiorgio Actually, it was all about what was popular in the clubs at that time because those radio stations were mainstream. They were on Capital, at the prime time on Saturday night. So they did reflect what was really popular in the clubs. You’d hear the main labels like West End and Salsoul and you'd hear things like this... (music: D-Train – “Keep Giving Me Love”) Kirk Degiorgio ...disco tune, but [The Fatback Band’s “King Tim III (Personality Jock)”] was probably the first ever rap record. And a couple weeks later Sugarhill Gang brought out “Rappers Delight.” So immediately I was aware that within the even the narrow disco and soul, there were other genres as well. Even at that very early stage I thought, “Right, OK, you can sub-divide it up.” I mean, people sub-divide it up like crazy now, but in those days I was aware of that. So there were different strands, and I was open-minded then. I didn’t hear rap and think that sounds terrible, I thought that sounds different, I don’t really understand it but it’s interesting and I like it. Whereas a lot of the soul DJs hated that music at the time. They were so purist, you know? They said it wasn’t singing, that it was just someone shouting. But then Grandmaster Flash and all that came along, and the eclecticism really started then. Especially in ‘82, when I heard “Planet Rock.” And that was the biggest head trip for me—since my auntie gave me records—was hearing something that I knew was funk, but it was like something I’d never heard of. It was all electronic, it was really repetetive. It had a rip of another record that I knew was a European band. It was just insane. And again, for some reason, I don’t really know why, I wasn’t totally open-minded to everthing at that time, but I really wanted to get into that. Whereas a lot of the soul DJs, they formed this thing called LADS, League Against Disco Shit, which was basically the old soul DJs would refuse to play electro records. Benji B Really? Kirk Degiorgio Some of those DJs are now huge dance music producers. I’m not going to name them. Benji B But that’s an interesting period because lots of people in this room probably started getting into music, or going out, after the dance music period had really begun. So, it’s always been a part of our lives. We’ve always known about clubs and BPMs and mixable records and quantized music and electronic culture. But there was a point, wasn't there, where people who are now...certainly, first-generation house and techno DJs before that, they were playing soul and jazz and rare groove and whatever else you call it. What was the point where electronic music and electronic parties, be it house, techno or whatever, started to really take over? Kirk Degiorgio They started taking over in ‘88 in the Summer of Love, after ecstasy became popular in the UK from the Balearic islands, from Ibiza or whatever. But I think there’s still a continuous strand back from an early period. The first time I was aware of electronic manipulation and other ways to make records out of the conventions of soul and jazz was hearing Adventures Of Grandmaster Flash On The Wheels Of Steel and Double Dee and Steinski’s Lesson One, you know? That was clearly made with electronics, turntables and editing material. And for me, that gave me my grounding in unconventional ways and electronic ways of hearing soul/funk music. And so, when that whole rave and house music period took over, for me it wasn’t as big a revolution and revelation as it was to other people, I think. Because for me it was just a continuation. But you’re right, there was a time when you had the conventional soul/jazz/funk DJs suddenly started to be more open-minded. I don’t know whether it was because they had a drug experience or whatever… Benji B We had Theo Parrish here the other day talking about the significance of the Midwest and the impact that’s had on other people’s lives musically, whether that be Chicago or Detroit. That’s definitely true for you, isn’t it? What was the significant point for you in terms of when you decided you wanted to get into making electronic music? Kirk Degiorgio Well, when I left university I went to work in a record shop because I didn’t know what the hell I was going to do. So I worked in a secondhand record shop in London and they used to send staff to America to buy rare soul and jazz and then ship it back and sell it. And so they sent a couple of us out in 1990, and I was just a Detroit techno head by then. The records weren’t that popular at the time—it was a very small scene—but I was just totally into it. And also the house thing: A few of the rare house, early Trax and DJ International were selling well in the shops. And so they sent us to Chicago, and I had a couple of friends with me, we hired a car and we used to drive around Chicago and we went to see Derrick Carter at Gramaphone Records at the time and he told us to go to a few distribution places. So we went down to Barney’s warehouse on the South Side and we went to Trax, we went to DJ International and saw Tyree...we went to Gherkin, I don’t know if you remember the Gherkin label? We saw all those guys and we bought a lot of records, we bought a lot of soul at the little out-of-the way stores and stuff. I’d just met Derrick May about two weeks previously in London. I had a Transmat t-shirt on and I felt this big strong hand come down on my shoulder and say, “Where the fuck did you get that t-shirt?” And I was like, “Oh God.” He said, “I’m only kidding, I know it’s a bootleg,” and we said, “Hi” and whatever. I said, “I’m your biggest fan,” and all the usual sort of crap. I told him I was going to be in Chicago. And he said, “Make the drive to Detroit, it’s only four or five hours’ drive to Detroit. If you can make it, I’ll be there and I’ll take you around a few record stores in Detroit that no one’s ever been to.” And I was like "OK," got his address. So when I was in Chicago, everyone I met, I were saying, “We’re going to Detroit,” and they were like, “Don’t go to Detroit.” And we’re like, “Why?” And they’re like, “Don't go to Detroit, it’s dangerous.” ”What?” And they’re going, “Seriously, do not go to Detroit. Not in a hire car, not with three of your friends, just don’t go.” We didn’t give a shit. So we drove to Detroit and the first stop I made was a place called Buy-Rite. We bought loads of great records and we said, “We’re looking for Gratiot Avenue, Derrick May’s place.” They said, “Yep, go down the end of the street take a right and head towards downtown.” They call it “Techno Boulevard,” a little corner. We’re all excited and stuff and we went down and it was a bit scary, for a white kid from the suburbs of England. It looks pretty scary. Just run down and kind of burnt out and stuff. I thought, “Shit, where are am I going?” Anyway, we parkedup, and there’s this big metal door with Metroplex written on it and we’re like, “Oh, God.” So we hammer on the door and this big guy comes up and is like, “Yeah? What do you want?” And that was “Shake,” Anthony Shakir and we're like [weedy English accent], “We’re from England. We've come to see Derrick May,” and all this and he just rolled his eyes, and was like, “Juan! There’s some crazy English people who’ve come all the way to see us.” We heard Juan go, “Bring ‘em in!” And they treated us so nicely, it was incredible. And that was the first time I’d been exposed to that media perception of some of the areas in America, where they think you’re going to get killed just because it’s a black area. If someone turned up at my house and had come all the way from England, I’d like to think that I’d be that friendly, but you know, I doubt it. They were incredible. They welcomed us in, we stayed there for like two days, they took us to the market opposite to get some food, they let us look through their record collections, and we bought a few records off Juan, he had some rare West End disco things. Benji B This is Juan Atkins, right? Kirk Degiorgio Yeah. There was Shake, Juan, and Kevin Saunderson was next door, I think Chez Damier was there by then. There was Marty Bonds, he was working with Juan on some tracks. And then they called this English guy down. They said, “Oh, there’s this English guy already here, he’s been here a few months, called Matt Cogger.” Now, I don’t know if you heard of Matt Cogger, Neuropolitique, but he was the first European to go over there to Detroit and check those guys out. And he was running Transmat for Derrick while Derrick was touring in England. And I still know Matt to this day, he’s not doing music now, but… Benji B Have you got a record from that period from that scene? Kirk Degiorgio I have, it’s in Ableton. Benji B Oh, are we gonna play that later? Kirk Degiorgio Yeah, if you want to do it later. Benji B But that’s an important time because it kind of brings us on to your production career. Because I believe that some of the first equipment you were using had something to do with that trip, right? Kirk Degiorgio Yeah, well, Matt ran Transmat for Derrick and eventually Derrick came back and Matt had to go back to England. And he had some of Derrick’s keyboards. And he didn’t have any studio space. So the revelation to me was going to Detroit and seeing the equipment that Juan used to make those Model 500 records. Benji B As far as influences go Model 500 and “Rhythim Is Rhythim” and those things, are seminal records for you, right? Kirk Degiorgio Yeah, they were like the classics for us. Obviously “Strings of Life” was massive, “It Is What It Is” was quite massive. “Feel Surreal,” but Model 500 was still quite underground and not that many people were into it. Seeing the equipment set-ups that they had, seeing what Derrick made “It Is What It Is” with… Because I’d grown up with all that disco and stuff I thought that a recording studio would have to be a 48-channel mixing desk and I thought you had to have a mixing engineer and you had to have a producer. And I'd see all the names listed, and all the equipment. And I thought that was for rich people or for record labels to give to musicians, and I was neither. I wasn't a rich kid and I wasn't a musician. So it never came into my head that I’d be doing music until I saw what these guys were using. Benji B And what were they using? Kirk Degiorgio Juan had a Pro One. Benji B What’s a Pro One? Kirk Degiorgio A Pro One is like a... In the early ‘80s Sequential Circuit made this quite small monophonic keyboard. It’s got a sequencer on it and it makes those classic arpeggios in the Model 500 tracks. Obviously, the 808, and reel-to-reel. I learnt from Matt and Derrick how to do those edits with the razor blade [makes slicing motion with hands]. I didn’t know anything about it, I didn't know how Derrick did those backwards bits, I just didn’t know how he did it. And Matt showed me. He said, “Yeah, Derrick does this, and you have to cut it across rather than down here, and the phase shifts, because you’re turning it upside down and everything.” It was all learning, all this stuff and it made sense because of what I had heard Double Dee and Steinski and all those guys do. Previously, when I was a kid and I used to tape those radio shows, and I’d started buying my first records, I used to do pause-button mixes. I had a double tape deck that had an overdub facility and I had a deck. So you’d play one record on the tape, record that, and then play the deck over the top and I’d vary the speed by speeding up with my finger [on the tape], or putting pressure on the deck, ‘cause it was just my mum’s. And then when you get the mix right, you’d lift [finger off] the pause button and you’d record it. And then you’d find a point at which you’d want to stop the mix and let the main record play and you’d put the pause button on again and put another mix in and release the pause button. I used to make like 30-minute mixes that would take me weeks to build up. So I had already kind of dabbled in it, but as for making music—because I wasn’t a musician I never thought I’d do it—I saw when you had a sequencer, you didn’t need to play anything. Benji B So when did you start making music? Kirk Degiorgio When I got back. I sold all my records, my whole record collection. Benji B Why? Kirk Degiorgio Because I didn’t have any money to buy the studio equipment. The only thing I had worth anything was my records. Benji B And what were you able to buy with that? Kirk Degiorgio It was quite a lot actually. It was about three grand that I got. I bought an Atari with Notator, I think at the time. I can't remember, it might have been Opcode Vision, I’m not sure, I can’t remember. I bought an R8, the Roland drum machine, which was kind of the latest drum machine, that was expensive at that time. I bought an S950 Akai sampler, which had quite a lot of memory. Benji B So you weren’t playing, you did alright. You got kitted out? Kirk Degiorgio I did, yeah. Benji B And what was the first record you made? Kirk Degiorgio The first record I made was a record called “Dance Intellect,” and I put it under my Future/Past name. Already I had the name worked out. This was going to be my early influences, but I’m going to bring that to techno. I had a broken 303...I can’t remember what was broken about it, I think the envelope didn’t work properly. And I just looped a 303 riff that I made and then reversed it. Benji B Have you got it here? Kirk Degiorgio No, I haven’t got it. Benji B Have you got anything from that period that you can play us to give us an idea of where your head was at? Kirk Degiorgio Sure. The second record I ever did was this: (music: Future/Past – “Clinically Inclined”) Kirk Degiorgio ...really make a difference? And if I keep on messing around, I’m never going to get it done.” And I have no answer. I know a lot of people have come up to me before and said, “I can never finish anything, and I’m never satisfied with it. I always think I can change this sound or that sound.” And I kind of think I could be dragged into that, so in my recording process I make decisions really early and I do things that I can’t change. Like, I print audio really quickly, instead of having it as a MIDI file that I can change the sound to a million different things, and say, “I wonder if this one sounds better, I wonder if that...” I don’t like to get trapped into that, so I just choose a sound, lay it down, and have to deal with that. Benji B So you started out on this basic equipment...let’s fast forward to 2006 and beyond. What is your weapon of choice these days? Kirk Degiorgio I had more equipment then than I do now. All I’ve got now is a real big modular synthesizer made by Bruce Duncan of Modcan up in Canada. And that’s the only piece of outboard snythesizer gear that I’ve got. Well, I use Pro Tools and I use Native Instruments, and that’s the only equipment I’ve got. Benji B To people who aren’t familiar with the techno history that you’re talking about, and certainly people who aren’t familiar with the music, they might find it strange that in the same breath you’re talking about jazz, soul and funk and soulful music, to what some people might seem like quite cold music, how do you bring warmth and emotion and that same soul to that electronic world? Kirk Degiorgio Well, that statement is kind of true, but to me, it’s bizarre. Because when I hear “It Is What It Is” or “Our Time” or “Night Drive (Thru-Babylon),” or “Journey of the Dragons”...they’re emotional records and they’ve got a hell of a lot of soul and warmth. To me, that's what techno is. Unfortunately, techno isn’t defined by what I think it is, it’s what it’s become. Like what you say, cold is the thing that’s associated with techno. The original blueprint for techno for me, was kind of cold, but it was emotional alienation and the city that it grew out of. It was all aobut that soulful history of a city that’s gone into chaos and decline and there is a huge emotion in that. Unfortunately, techno is often now associated with just noises. And those noises organized into a club sound, or an atonal kind of structure. That’s not what techno meant to me, or what I got into techno for. Techno is still that emotional kind of soulfulness and the beats had a hard funk edge to it. Benji B Over the years you’ve been associated with various musical styles, from drum & bass, broken beat, techno, house, whatever and musical peers, you’ve done work with the likes of Dego from 4Hero and Carl Craig. Can you tell me a bit about your musical peers and the different styles that you're involved with? Kirk Degiorgio Well, there was a period after I’d made a couple of techno albums where techno really got into that European rave thing. Where everything was pitched up to 140 BPM and everything became really rigid. And it had very little to do with what I was originally into to techno for. And I was just a bit jaded and frustrated at going into the record shop and never finding the records I liked. Techno was bigger than ever. People say the peak of techno was ‘94-’95 and I just could not find the inspirational records to go out and DJ with or go and listen to. And I listen to all kinds of music at home, and I’ve always been open-minded, and when I first heard drum & bass, it was too ravey and a bit gimmicky. Speeded-up chipmunk voices it was kind of for kids and I was kind of aloof to it. Benji B Is this sort of jungle era, or more breakbeat hardcore era? Kirk Degiorgio I don’t really know what names you’d call it at that stage, but this would be ‘94, and some of my friends were making those records to make money. I was around there when a great techno producer would make these records. We‘d be rolling around on the floor laughing. It was purely for making money to fund his techno label. So I had a really kind of patronising view about that whole thing. But then, I had to move back to Ipswich in 1995 for a period. Drum & bass was huge in Ipswich, and they had a record store. I used to go and see my old friend, just to say hi. And I started hearing, just these amazing drum & bass tunes, that weren’t like any of the kind of rave and jungle that I’d heard before. I bought a few of them and I had about five, six or seven and they were all by two people: They were either by Peshay or Photek. And so I went back to the record shop and was like, “Who the hell are these guys? This music is amazing.” The chords are like the techno kind of influence and the breaks are kind of different to everything else you hear. And they told me that Photek lives up the road, and I’m like, “What?” “Yeah he’s from Ipswich, here’s his number.” So I called him and it was that usual thing, like, “I’ve just heard some of your stuff I’m a big fan,” and he just knew everything about me. He knew everything about my label, knew all about the early Detroit stuff and said, “C’mon, let’s do some records together.” And I went to his studio—he just had a sampler and an Atari. And I actually fell asleep, because he would spend five hours doing the snare pattern. It was like “ZZZzzz” and he’s just meticulous about doing his EQing and everything. Benji B You can definitely hear that in his records, and I’ve heard him in interviews as well, always when they ask about his influences, he's like Kirk, A.R.T.... Kirk Degiorgio Well, there’s the famous track “KJZ.” “Kirk’s jazz,” that’s what it means. It's because I gave him...I love giving tapes out. Benji B Have you got that with you? Kirk Degiorgio I haven't, no. I was just giving him stuff with drums on ‘cause I said, “You know, your drums sound like Elvin Jones.” And he kind of knew a bit about that but not really heavy. You know, I love doing tapes for people, and I'd give him some tapes and stuff, and he found a few drum breaks and that’s why he named that track after me after giving him some jazz things. (music: unknown) Benji B Alright, thanks very much, Kirk Kirk Degiorgio OK, thanks, Benji.

Lars Bartkuhn
The virtues of dance music are either setting the pace or, in most cases, at least keeping up with the ever-changing flavours of the season. Lars Bartkuhn has a different ambition. He’s aiming for longevity, combining influences like classic deep house, soul, funk or Brazilian music with modern jazz elements. Together with his brother Marek and Yannick Elverfeld he set up Needs Music in 1999, a production threesome and label based in Frankfurt that rose to international fame among music lovers and dancers with songs like “Worlds.” For his solo projects, Bartkuhn also uses the names Laurentius and Passion Dance Orchestra, to spell out his deep love of fusion music. In this lecture at the 2004 Red Bull Music Academy, he talks about some of his most-loved records and how they've influenced his unique approach to production.
Hosted by Fergus Murphy Once again, a big welcome to Lars Bartkuhn from Frankfurt, the Needs label, lovers of the deeper, more musical side of house music. We’re going to start nice and easy this morning. We got a whole bunch of music. We’ll talk to Lars about his influences and his inspirations. We’ll kick things off with a very recent track. Lars Bartkuhn More or less recent. It’s not so new. Fergus Murphy This is called “The Wake Up Call.” (music: Laurentius – “Over the Sea” / applause) Lars Bartkuhn This song is two or three years old. It’s a project of mine called Laurentius, which is the Latin origin of my name. The song is called “Over the Sea.” It’s how I would feel if I could be there. Fergus Murphy Over the sea? Lars Bartkuhn Exactly. Fergus Murphy Please tell us about the Needs label and the crew. Lars Bartkuhn It’s me, myself and I… No, it’s three guys. Me, my brother Marek and a good friend of ours named Yannick. His real name is Jan Elverfeld. But if you know him, you will know him as Yannick, as a DJ, journalist and former editor of the Groove magazine. So we’re a trio. We formed the label in 1998. At that time we started hanging out together and producing music. Me and my brother, we did music before that, but then Yannick joined us. It just was the right chemistry and we came up with our first record pretty quickly. We didn’t know where to send our music. There was no label we felt connected to, so we just did it our own. And once we started, we got used to it very quickly. Fergus Murphy And that was Needs. In what year did the first record come out? Lars Bartkuhn I think it was 1999. But I’m not good with dates. Fergus Murphy Would you describe the label as a house music label? Lars Bartkuhn I think I have to. Even though I don’t feel comfortable with the term so much today, it’s a house label, yes. Fergus Murphy Why would you not feel comfortable with the term? Lars Bartkuhn Because we try to do things a bit different, take things from the music called house – what we love – but do a little bit different, arrangements that you don’t hear in this kind of music, an instrumentation that is unusual for house and a harmonic input that is not so common in dancefloor music. Even though dance music always had a focus on stealing from other styles, we felt like the house music scene of our time is too limited. Fergus Murphy So you don’t feel at home listening to the latest house releases? Lars Bartkuhn Not really. I did listen a lot to house music, of course. I studied my stuff. But today it’s like, I have to be honest, my friend is checking out the records for me. He gives me the stuff he recommends. And even if I get ten records, it’s only one that I like. Fergus Murphy So what is it you’re not feeling at the moment? Lars Bartkuhn Should we really talk about this kind of negative stuff? Fergus Murphy I think it’s not necessarily negative. Lars Bartkuhn It’s bothering me to hear the same song over and over again, I must say. People who were really having a good constant good output for a period of ten years now have a constant bad output long since. Listening to their stuff, it’s just not inspiring anymore; they are repeating their formula, repeating their chemistry. This magic, innocent touch of the music is pretty much gone. I don’t want to sound arrogant; it’s just how I feel. I’m not sure if I succeed on my own template, but I try my best to make it at least a little bit fresh. Fergus Murphy To get away from the formula? Lars Bartkuhn Yes. Fergus Murphy And what would be your inspirations in house music? Lars Bartkuhn Of course, there’s many. Larry Heard’s old stuff, Kerri Chandler, Ron Trent, Blaze – all that stuff. They still do great music sometimes, but there was a time when I was digging just every single note in every record. There was nothing bad they did. For me, it was all just perfect. I have a whole shelf of records of each of these artists. And many others. John Robinson, Danny Tenaglia, Detroit stuff – Mad Mike. The obvious, I must say. It’s nothing super underground or special. I just like the classics. Fergus Murphy But today you feel like that most artists are repeating themselves? Lars Bartkuhn Yes. I remember last year, there’s been a couple of records everybody was talking about. But they are like the old stuff, like the old Kerri Chandler. And that’s exactly what I hate. If he was the old Kerri Chandler, he would do something that sounds new. Because every good Kerri Chandler record was something crazy, something new. To hear the old sounds from Atmosphere, that doesn’t inspire me in no way. That’s a problem in todays music scene. People have too much understanding of what is going on in music. They have a system of categorizing the whole stuff. Like, “Now we’re doing this kind of song.” In their computers, they have all the sounds already. There is no exploring. I don’t know how people are producing their music. But it seems like they have their set-up. They don’t travel. They are inside a room they know perfectly. Of course, it’s good to have skills and routine, but your mind should be open for doing some really new stuff. To me, house music was once like a journey into something that I didn’t know before, every song… Even though it’s a really simple music, there was so much going on. Fergus Murphy But you came to it as a musician? Lars Bartkuhn Yes, of course. You mean that I have been playing an instrument? Fergus Murphy Yes, exactly. You are classically-trained, am I right? Lars Bartkuhn A bit. A bit of everything. What I was really doing a lot was studying jazz guitar. For ten years I didn’t do anything else other than practicing – eight, ten hours a day. I went to university and studied jazz. But I also practiced classical piano and classical guitar. That’s my official graduation. Fergus Murphy Have you always been listening to club music? Lars Bartkuhn Actually, not consciously. All the time, I was listening to music that has a meaning to club music. But I wasn’t listening to club music for a long time. Six or seven years ago, I started going to these shops that are offering especially club music. But of course, I was always been listening to music that was in a way clubby or danceable, or whatever. I have been listening to Stevie Wonder – what better club music can you have? Even though I didn’t go to clubs, I loved soul, funk, some jazz funk, boogie and all this kind of stuff. Fergus Murphy Would you describe that as music where the rhythm is upfront? Lars Bartkuhn Not necessarily. Rhythm is the foundation, of course. Melodies need rhythm. Each melody also has a rhythm and a clave of its own. You can just clap a melody. Sometimes you can understand from the clapping what melody is meant. But I’m a very harmonic, romantic guy, I must say. I love to get lost in harmony when playing on my piano or keyboard. Fergus Murphy Can you clap “Superstition”? Lars Bartkuh No, you wouldn’t recognize it. But I could clap “Jingle Bells” and everybody would hear that it’s “Jingle Bells.” Fergus Murphy Give us a demonstration, please. Lars Bartkuhn OK. [claps “Jingle Bells”] You would immediately understand that it’s “Jingle Bells.” Fergus Murphy Christmas comes early this year. Lars Bartkuhn Let’s wait for Christmas. Then we’ll do a workshop on clapping Christmas tunes. I do that for my family every year. Fergus Murphy You’re the clapping guy. Let’s play another tune. Tell us about it Lars Bartkuhn It’s a classic. I picked this one because I want to show you how different music can sound. But to me it’s still connected in a way, even though I don’t want to compare myself to this. It’s the stuff where I draw my inspiration from. It’s a band called Wood, Brass & Steel, the song is called “Funkanova.” Fergus Murphy It’s a disco classic… Lars Bartkuhn It became a disco classic. But it’s definitely a jazz funk jam. It’s nothing related to the disco scene. The guys have been playing some straight funk, like Headhunters stuff. They added some good harmonic brass. I wouldn’t call it disco. But just check it out. (music: Wood, Brass & Steel – “Funkanova” / applause) Fergus Murphy What are the elements that you consider to be important for your music? Lars Bartkuhn It’s hard to give a short answer to that question. As many other songs of that era, this song is containing all the elements that are important for me. First of all, it’s just the way it sounds and the instrumentation. The sound of certain instruments combined with each other can be already an inspiration to me. Like the Solina strings. I don’t know if you've heard about it. A synthesizer. Later on, after the company had been bought by ARP, this synthesizer was called ARP strings. This was a machine with beautiful string sounds. Before there were samplers imitating strings, the synthesizers may have sounded very synthetic. But their feeling was much closer to the string effects of a big orchestra. The arrangement of this song is also an inspiration; the way it’s layered up, the chord progression, and it’s leaving enough space for the hook and bassline. Audience Member The bass of that song is great. Lars Bartkuhn Yes, it’s a killer bassline. Everything is killer. It’s a constant groove without being too tight. That’s something I don’t like about the disco movement. It became too good. This song leaves the feeling of having a jam session in a garage. It’s not played after a metronome, like the later disco producers did. Audience Member Lars, would you say that you were inspired by this sort of music 20 years later? Lars Bartkuhn That’s why I picked it up. Audience Member I mean, I found references in that sound. So I don’t want to deny that… Lars Bartkuhn You can tell me. I steal a lot from this music. I use the term “steal, many other say they get inspired. Of course, I am inspired. But in a way, it’s a big supermarket. There’s all the music history, I steal the vibe and try to play it with my own skills. Of course, I try to be as inspired as possible. Actually, I just do music when I have the feel for it. I don’t produce every day. In this case, there’s just something that you have to steal as a producer, I think; think of the spacey guitars. Whenever I plug in my old tape delay and play my guitar or Rhodes, I feel like I’m part of that band. I have to imitate them. I imitate the language of this music in my dialect. Fergus Murphy You have another track there that is a big inspiration. Lars Bartkuhn What I’m carrying with me is just inspiration. The next song is a popular song, I would say. I saw a boxing documentation on TV, and George Foreman was entering the ring with that song. This made him pretty sympathetic. If I was boxer, I would choose this for sure. Nobody could defeat me. Just listen to it. (music: Asso – “Don’t Stop” / applause) I wish I had done this track. This is an Italian band from the ’80s. I think they were just doing soundtracks. Their name is Asso. The song is called “Don’t Stop,” it’s really rare. I was introduced to it by Ron Trent actually, on a compilation. My friend Anthony Nicholson, a producer from Chicago, they listen to a lot of ’80s stuff that is not the obvious ’80s music. It’s almost the same sound we know from today – in terms of the hypnotic atmospheres, the pad sounds and it’s pattern-oriented. “Don’t Stop” is another perfect song. It’s exactly the same as we heard from Wood, Brass & Steel, only with a very different instrumentation. Both tracks are mind-expanding funk music. It gives you a good feeling, you want to close your eyes and dance to it. The Asso song is not acoustic at all, it’s electronic. But I think that they were inspired by music like that Funkanova tune. This kind of music keeps me going. Fergus Murphy You said this Asso song is very rare? Lars Bartkuhn I just have it from this compilation. I know the original record from my friend’s house. He has a vinyl copy. As far as I know, people are paying a lot of money for it in New York dance shops. I wouldn’t do that. Fergus Murphy Maybe it will turn up in Rome. Lars Bartkuhn Exactly, I never thought about that. Let’s go to the shops today and find it. Tomorrow we can count the copies we have. If you want, I can now play a joint of mine, which is a bit more fusion-y, more jazz-inspired. It’s something that I see in the middle of all that. In Germany we would say “noodling,” which means that there is a lot of playing going on. It’s more complex, but I tried to get into this rhythm. I play a little bit now, it’s called “Windy City” and it’s about Chicago. (music: Lars Bartkuhn – “Windy City” / applause) Fergus Murphy That’s a heavy tune. Lars Bartkuhn Yes, there’s some music inside of it, lots of music… Fergus Murphy That’s your own thing? Is it a studio production? Lars Bartkuhn Yes, a studio production. It’s hard to talk about it, actually. It’s a song I wrote. And then I went to the studio and played the instruments. Fergus Murphy You played all the instruments on there? Lars Bartkuhn Some are programmed, some are played. Fergus Murphy It’s got that kind of live feeling that the Wood, Brass & Steel had. Lars Bartkuhn Exactly! You see, this is why I wanted to play you these tunes before – “Funkanova” by Wood, Brass & Steel and this Asso song. I feel like being in the middle of these two songs. My song has this ’80s styled, harsh bass sound. Audience Member You said you wrote the song and then brought it to the studio and then recorded it. Lars Bartkuhn This sounds much more professional than it actually is. My studio is next to my bed. So I wrote it in my bed and then took it to my studio. I’m kidding. Audience Member Do you actually write notes down? Lars Bartkuhn Sometimes. I’m a forgetful person. So I have to write things down sometimes. Even though I’m bad at reading notes, I can write a bit. This helps me to remember melodies that came to my mind. When I say that I write songs, that’s what people say. Of course, the songs are not really written. Composing a song, that would sound even worse. I came up with this idea, just to be humble. Audience Member Do you feel there’s some space for improvisation in your music? Lars Bartkuhn What do you think? Audience Member What’s your approach? Lars Bartkuhn My approach is what you heard. I mean, there was some I think some improvisation pretty obviously, like in terms of soloing, in terms of rhythmic freedom. I don’t have patterns that go throughout the whole song. I play the whole song through, and when I feel like doing a break, I do a break. That’s improvisation. even though it’s of course produced. I feel like that’s a long time improvisation, the whole process in the studio. There should be something going on that makes you twist a little bit and not so boring. Audience Member But in the jazz you keep some parts for free improvisation. Lars Bartkuhn Ah, you mean free improvisation? I wouldn’t say there’s free improvisation. Audience Member Solos. You have that part, that 10 bars for example in a tune that you’re producing and then you decide, “Well, here I’m not going to follow a plan. I’m going to solo, I’m gonna… and whatever comes to my mind, here it is.” That’s what remains. Lars Bartkuhn So the improvising aspect. Audience Member Yeah, free improvising. In a jazzy style. Lars Bartkuhn Yeah but you know jazzers would complain about its simplicity and would complain about its… it’s still very pattern-like. Compared to other pattern music it’s not so pattern-like, but if you compare it to straight-ahead played music, of course there’s a lot of pattern. I put a lot of hooks that repeat in a way. Audience Member What’s up Lars? First of all, how old is that track? Lars Bartkuhn That track is one and a half years, something like that. That’s not out yet. And I don’t know about it actually. Audience Member Do you guys have to work with guys maybe from South Africa? Because [inaudible] did a track with [inaudible]. Do you have guys have plans to do something with South Africa? Lars Bartkuhn Yeah my friend Yannick’s been there once and he had a good time, that’s all I know. I haven’t been there yet, but of course I would love to work with people who feel it, but it hasn’t happened, anything yet. In a way we are very isolated, hanging out, just together you know, and we haven’t done so much on other labels. Audience Member Maybe in the future some time? Lars Bartkuhn If it happens, yeah. But I don’t see this music on any other label, actually I don’t see it on our label right now. I just have a piece of music, just listen to it, that’s it. We have to wait. I don’t know yet. Fergus Murphy Our man here is gonna hook it up. Audience Member How relevant do you think your education was in what you do now? Lars Bartkuhn What do you mean, education? Ah, this kind of education. Because everything is education. Audience Member Formal, institutional education. Lars Bartkuhn Important. Very important. But I could live without it, but now that I have it, it’s important. I don’t have so much. There’s other students who studied better, they have skills in theory and all this, but still it’s a good tool to have. But of course we all know there’s music without all that that works too. Once you have it, you like using it sometimes. Audience Member What is going on through your head? Is it sad, were you dumped recently is or something? [laughter] Lars Bartkuhn You’re right. That’s a sad song to me. it’s a classic situation. I like making positive music when I need it, and I like making melancholy music when my life is too simple. So it’s always looking for something, some escape, whatever. But I forgot about it. I just know that I, I remember one thing, I made it before I first went to Chicago to see my friend. I needed to bring a new piece because he was so productive at that time, and I think that was the hook for that song, just bringing something, a gift, to Chicago. That’s what I call the Windy City. Audience Member In the production process of that last track, did you have some real instruments, at least an electric piano, a real Clavinet, or was it only synthesizer instruments? Lars Bartkuhn First of all there’s a lot of heavy guitar playing in the music. Audience Member Real guitar? Lars Bartkuhn I don’t know yet the synthesizer guitar. Audience Member Steinberg Virtual Guitarist. Lars Bartkuhn No, it’s a real guitar. Audience Member OK. Lars Bartkuhn I mean, I would be stupid if I wouldn’t use it. It’s something I know at least a little bit about so I use the guitar from time to time. actually I use it more and more. what else? There’s electric keyboards. I do some little percussions, but in my studio it’s impossible to play the djembe or the conga. I have this little bedroom studio, you know. I have to make the big sounds in the smallest possible way, with my headphones on and program like this. Audience Member Is the bass real? Lars Bartkuhn The bass? No. But who cares? It’s a synthesizer bass, but I play it like, I feel a lot like playing it. that’s important. Audience Member Regarding synthesizers, you use hardware pieces or virtual instruments? Lars Bartkuhn At that time I didn’t have virtual or whatever. I just have this for a couple months now, and I hardly use it I must say. if it’s electronic it should be at least — what’s the word? — touchy. I need that, I must say. Audience Member Can you talk about your ‘70s jazz fusion idols? Joe Zawinul, George Duke, Herbie Hancock? Lars Bartkuhn In terms of the style, I would definitely compare this song to this type of music. George Duke of a certain time is definitely a big hero of mine. I really love the funkitivity and the positivity of his music. It’s a hard groove that makes you smile very much. And once you smile, you can dance. It makes your soul dance first, and then your feet will follow. Audience Member Can you give us a little list of influences? Lars Bartkuhn OK, all George Duke until the early ’80s is really good. If you like, we can listen to “Brazilian Love Affair” of course. This songs means a lot to me. I’m really a fusion guy, I must say. Fergus Murphy This has been sampled to death… Lars Bartkuhn Is it? Fergus Murphy Wasn’t it that “Africa” tune from Meitz, the intro? Lars Bartkuhn I don’t know. (music: George Duke – “Brazilian Love Affair” / applause) I like all the obvious stuff from that time, like Herbie Hancock, George Duke, Eddie Henderson, also Brazilian jazz funk like Azymuth or Airto. Unfortunately, drum computers and the metronome killed a lot in this style of music in the ’80s. They lost control over the music. Audience Member How do you like Weather Report? Lars Bartkuhn I like them, of course. I also wanted to play you a song by Jaco Pastorius. But it’s such a long song. We should just skip through to the part I wanted to show you. This kind of music has a lot of impact on me and many other people. I try to focus more on the harmonic aspects. It’s not just the bassline and the drums, the chords are funky as well. You can get a lot of inspiration from the way they treat the keys and the melodies. It’s very complex. I like that about music. Audience Member Like you said you were just talking about the metronome, the electronic stuff, has kind of made a major influence in the music obviously, no? You’ve come from a very classically-trained background, and when you arrived to the electronic field of music, what other difficulties do you find? A lot of music now is lacking harmonies or melodies, and this metronome feeling. What else do you think in terms of the new electronic music, what else do you think have been one of the problems to make electronic music a little bit boring now? Lars Bartkuhn I just mentioned the metronome and all this kind of stuff for the reason why this music turned down. Of course I’m a big fan of it, makes things pretty easy on your computer and editing your music and all that, but in general it’s nothing bad of course. Audience Member It’s just another avenue, but I can understand where you’re coming from. Sometimes I find that some electronic music lacks melodies and harmonies like you say. Lars Bartkuhn And lacks a lot of natural feeling. Of course there’s cats around like Osunlade who knows to do music that just sounds like… Audience Member Who has a touch on the machines… Lars Bartkuhn You feel some human is doing this music. The best example for me is this Mad Mike music from Detroit, like Underground Resistance. They have harsh techno but it sounds very human. They understood how to talk through machines. I don’t know all the stories but to me it just sounds like at the time synthesizers were really cheap, and that’s why they used synthesizers. Guitars became more expensive and that’s why they took the guitar side and used the synthesizer. They have the same approach, I would say. Just try to vibrate. That’s it, you know? Audience Member It seems like now everyone’s gone to the machines, now they’ve gone full circle and gone back to using acoustic materials. Lars Bartkuhn I think everybody tells the same story. There’s many people doing club music who have an instrument background, I would say. Once you see all the possibility and the control you can have music you are fascinated by, and then one day you see, “I studied so much before, I should bring that into the music.” In the beginning my brother said, “Why don’t you use the guitar stuff? It would make our music much more organic.” And I said, “No, no, I like these cheesy guitar sounds of the synthesizer.” Or whatever, you know. And today of course I try to combine. It’s the same boring story everybody tells you. But still many people today have an organic sound, “organic” sound, which is still not very vivid. I would say not very communicative, because they are happy if they have three or four chords, and then they do the same shit over and over and repeat. Audience Member Do you think it’s really important that people have their own sample material? A sample library or their own sample sources? Lars Bartkuhn Oh don’t talk with me about libraries. Every song I do, I do from scratch. I don’t have libraries. I have no hard disk or whatever for sample stuff. if I feel like sampling I do, if not I don’t. I don’t have a library. Sometimes I have to ask friends for records and stuff like that, if I want to sample. Obviously what we heard is not so sample-based, my music. Audience Member And for example when you’re using your synthesizers or using your sampled sounds, they’re coming directly from the machines or no? Lars Bartkuhn Most of it, yeah. And I sample myself, of course. I play guitar and sample and experiment with that. I sample vocals, my own voice or whatever and play with it, build up layers and combine sounds. But technically you can get too much information, because I don’t have a recipe how to do. Every song can be different, so I’m doing very jam music, very programmed. But I’m not a really good programmer. Audience Member Do you look for new sounds for inspiration? Lars Bartkuhn Always, always. Constantly. I’m not this nerd who says I have to program every sound by myself, but I want to have my own sound, my own voice of course. Sometimes I use standard sounds, but bring them together in a way that I think is not too common. Audience Member Do you think it’s really important for a person making music to find their own little niches or little sounds that help them put a personal feeling in their music? Lars Bartkuhn You mean if it’s important… Audience Member For example a track might stand out because it has something that is odd or has a sound that is quite different from another track. Do you think it’s really important to not keep the same sounds happening but keep resourcing different sounds and different ways of making different sounds? Lars Bartkuhn That’s a pretty difficult issue for me. Audience Member I imagine your ears are very trained and very harmonic, very clear sounds. Lars Bartkuhn I don’t know, that’s a pretty long question. In a way, I think it’s important to have a sound, but the sound is of course not the most important thing. For instance, if I ask you, most of you produce music, I think. And I think most of you say, “Oh, my studio sucks, I would like to have this and this equipment.” Most people I know say that, I’m sure. And I think that’s just wrong, because then you put too much emphasis on the outside. We did our stuff in the beginning with the most simple stuff. Some people still, I was told, listen to them, and sometimes when I listen back to it, I think, “Ew.” Audience Member It’s important to go back to the basics, do you think? Lars Bartkuhn Yeah and you can use the most obvious stuff and have a lot of fun with it. That’s the most important thing. Now we got it. Just jam around with the stuff you have, and then you can have something new, something fresh, even though it doesn’t sound so futuristic. Audience Member With a live band you can feel the conversation with the instruments that’s happening. Now with MIDI and stuff you can also have that same conversation with the machines. Do you find that’s really important when you’re making music with other people in the studio, or by yourself only? Lars Bartkuhn Now I have to say something. I don’t want to sound ridiculous because I’m just a producer, but think of Stevie Wonder. He did all the instruments himself and had a conversation on his records that there’s more communication and inspiration going on than bands playing. That pretty much answers your question. I don’t care if it’s a band or someone alone, all you need is a vision for how it sounds all together. Of course I love bands. There’s this guy Shuggie Otis who produced this album on his own, and it sounds like a band is playing. I love that, you know? I love both concepts. Audience Member For the last two years or something, house has been really stagnant. I know you mentioned Osunlade, I think he’s super revolutionary. I kind of dissected his music. He’s using a lot of live instruments as well. Lars Bartkuhn But it’s not about the live instruments. He can do tracks that are very techno-y. Audience Member Exactly. And that’s still interesting, also stuff like Metro Area. I just would like to know what other people there are. Lars Bartkuhn In this kind of style you mean? You already mentioned some of today’s producers. But I have to make an advertisement my best buddy, Anthony Nicholson. He’s putting out great music, if he’s putting out music at all. He is so fucked up by the scene that he doesn’t see a point in releasing music. Fergus Murphy He doesn’t want to release records? Lars Bartkuhn Not right now. He’s studying and producing a lot. We exchange stuff. I get a kick out of his music. If you like, I can play something later. Anthony started as a co-producer of Ron Trent. I don’t know if you remember the music on the Clairaudience label. That was something that made me a real fan of the music. At that point I thought, “Hey, you can do everything with this music.” This was a revolution. Many people didn’t understand that these were the guys that brought back influences that had been lost for 15 or 20 years. Now it’s some other people getting respect for sampling or imitating disco records, which is wrong. There’s other people who did that before. I still like the stuff that is being done today. But there’s others who tried before. They just didn’t get the credits, maybe because they did more subtle music, music that needs more time to be listened to. Their records may be a bit rougher, not so super well-produced. Ron Trent is still inspiring me, Osunlade is a good man. Tell me some names, I’m not good with names. Audience Member Lars Bartkuhn Yes, of course. But what is this? It’s music music. This is like the next step we all should take. We shouldn’t think about limitations and genres. Actually, I don’t call the music we’re talking about house music. It’s all house-y, but house music had a certain feeling. It was hypnotic. Like Larry Heard, that’s house. It’s just beautiful music. Sometimes it has more in common with Brazilian music than with house. And Amp Fiddler, that’s just modern soul to me. Fergus Murphy You were talking about this Jaco track. Lars Bartkuhn I’m going to play it now. The next song is from Jaco Pastorius. (music: Jaco Pastorius – “John and Mary”) That’s just something that clears your mind after all this simplistic music or whatever. It is something to clean your soul and your mind. This jam has inspired a lot. Audience Member I think we all would like to know how this is called exactly. Could you please spell it out? The track title, the barcode, everything. Lars Bartkuhn It’s from a Jaco Pastorius album called Word of Mouth. It’s the Word of Mouth band playing, which was his big band at that time. The album was released in 1981. The song is called “John and Mary.” It’s a killer song, we just heard the last piece. It’s like a symphony. The whole album is a killer. There’s a cover of “Blackbird” by the Beatles on it, then it has some Bach – Toccata – all in this Weather Report style, of course. All the cats from that time are playing, Herbie, Don Alias on percussion… Audience Member I wanted to ask you something. Do you actually earn a living from making records? Lars Bartkuhn Ah, me, myself? No, no. I couldn’t because I had to work on things that I don’t feel like working on. I just do music whenever I feel like that. Sometimes I don’t feel like making music for months. But on the other hand I need to have some food in the refrigerator. So I can’t rely on music. I did that for some years. But I’m doing jobs that are related to music. I’m a teacher in a music school. Of course, I am a musician in this job. But I would never dare to think of an existence based on the kind of music that I’m doing. Audience Member Why can’t you make a living on the music you make? Lars Bartkuhn I have enough music. But I would have to compromise. I don’t want to do this. Today, I hear the compromise in music, even more than ever before. Even the guys we were talking about are limiting themselves today. And I hate that. I couldn’t live like that, you know. I couldn’t live having a musical taste that spans around the whole planet and you just focus on the same tempo every day. I just couldn’t. Audience Member Do you think that by not producing music every day, by producing music only when you feel like, only when you are inspired by something that you have heard or seen, one can be more creative? Lars Bartkuhn Inspiration is the reason why I’m doing music in a way. Of course, music is just an experiment sometimes. At the end, you will have something, just by studying your machines or instruments and playing around with them. You don’t have to be in this Beethoven mood every day. Of course, this is what I’m looking for most of the time, but sometimes I’m just playing around and at the end of the day you find, “Ah, that’s a good idea” – working with this machine or with that chord progression. Then the inspiration can enter the production. Audience Member Is it a process of your mind or your emotions when you’re dealing with your music? Lars Bartkuhn Yes, a whole lot, I must say. Audience Member Do you work in the studio until you finish your music or do you work on a track, leave it, come back, revise it? Lars Bartkuhn No, I quit anything for finishing the song. I once got fired by a company because I forgot to go to work. Audience Member And did you finish the track? Lars Bartkuhn Yeah, I finished it. And I liked it. Fergus Murphy Was it worth it? Lars Bartkuhn For me? Yeah, it was worth it. I’m happy and proud of that song – even though I didn’t get paid for it. Audience Member What is the longest time you spent making a track? Lars Bartkuhn Oh my god, all these questions, I don’t know. The last song of mine we heard, that fusion thing, this was done in a day. But sometimes it takes me six weeks or something like that. I’m listening to it over and over again, I’m not happy with it. After four weeks, all of a sudden, I might say, “It’s OK, forget it. We’ll leave it as it is.” So I don’t spend six weeks with programming and producing. It’s more about listening and finding my peace with a song in a situation. Audience Member Can I ask you something about the label? How many artists have you got on Needs? Lars Bartkuhn It’s us under different names, I would say. Apart from that we have one release by our friend Anthony Nicholson and one by French producer Franck Roger. We forgot to talk about this man. He’s doing some funny and cool music, even though he also became very repetitive in the last 12 months. But he did a song for us and we’re very happy having that on our label. But that’s it so far. Then we’re gonna release a song by a jazz singer; I did the production. She’s a friend of mine, I travelled with her around the country playing in jazz quartets. She’s a dope singer. Fergus Murphy And this is coming out on Needs? Lars Bartkuhn We hope so. Let’s check this. (music: Lühning – “All Over” / applause) Audience Member Where can I buy this music? Lars Bartkuhn Not yet. It’s gonna be released later on, on our label. So check it out. Audience Member Will online shopping be available? I’m from Brazil. Lars Bartkuhn Yeah we should think about that, we are dinosaurs when it comes to that. I think we have a prototype homepage since two months. Audience Member [inaudible] Lars Bartkuhn If you say. Audience member [inaudible] Audience member Please make your music available. Lars Bartkuhn You can go to the homepage of Grooveattack, our distributor. It’s not so complicated. Audience Member [inaudible] Lars Bartkuhn No, I don’t do that. Audience Member You have your label, which is fantastic, and when you go to a company for distribution, which one did you decide to go with or... Lars Bartkuhn It’s our first distributor. It’s Grooveattack in Cologne. We feel like working with... Actually it seems like it was a good decision because they’re the only one alive right now because all the others had problems I would say, financially and all this. Audience Member Have they been good with distributing your records widely around Europe or, for example, overseas? Lars Bartkuhn Yeah, I can’t complain actually. We are a little underground label and we are doing well. People like the stuff... Audience Member [inaudible] or around the world, no? Lars Bartkuhn Yeah, it sounds bigger than it is. There’s ten people here, five there, maybe twenty there and... Fergus Murphy Your fans are pretty loyal I think? Lars Bartkuhn Yeah, loyal and if it wasn’t for them we would be lost for sure, you’re right. Audience Member I know there’s lots of new formats for music coming out, are you still going to be using, in the future, vinyl for your format or are you thinking that CDs are a better format or ...? Lars Bartkuhn CDs are a better format when you want to promote your music. You don’t have to pay so much on the mail out, for instance. CD’s cool for checking new music of course. They will never die. Audience Member For your company, for example, do you think that... Are you biased at all in this area? Do you feel biased between using CDs or vinyl? Lars Bartkuhn If I see a difference? Audience Member Are you biased? You prefer to just make your music on records or you don’t mind whatever format? Lars Bartkuhn The format that I prefer? Audience Member Yeah. Lars Bartkuhn I’m going to say many people don’t understand but I’m a CD fan. The sound’s not so warm, but I like laying down in my bed and listening to music and don’t have to get up. Of course, you can do that with your MP3 player. A good Brazilian record, I need to have also on CD because the copies suck. Once you buy some Brazilian records, they’re all scratches and they’re very expensive. I like them on CDs, sounds clear and you get all the details and I like that. For instance, I just released an album and so far it’s just released on CD because I want people to listen to it. I don’t want... If it’s on double vinyl I know what’s going to happen, it’s like a double EP. That’s the way people treat records or albums and they are right because it’s many unimportant albums coming out, but I want to just give this kind of... You can listen straight from the first to the last song and have a good time. If you have it on vinyl while releasing it, it’s going to be, people pick one song for their DJ booth. Audience Member You’re not thinking exactly on, for example, that DJ’s were going to play your work but you’re actually thinking of the wider audience who are going to be listening to your work? Lars Bartkuhn It depends. This was like a mixture. There was like the dance version of the song. Audience Member For example, if you have a song that you find particularly dance-orientated, you’re more inclined to put it on, for example, vinyl because you know it’s going to sound good on the dancefloor? Is that the point or... Lars Bartkuhn Yeah, I don’t think too much about it. It’s just something that comes along with it. Once you make a song that is to be played in the club, of course you put it on vinyl. That’s the thing you know. Fergus Murphy Any more questions? Audience Member The name of the previous song. Lars Bartkuhn Okay, this is not on the album. This is just the project. Audience Member Yeah, it’s the project... Lars Bartkuhn The project’s kind of... I don’t know the name actually because it’s up to the singer who wrote the song, she wrote the song. Audience Member What’s the name of the singer? Lars Bartkuhn The singer’s called Inga Lühning. She’s from Germany, living in Cologne. Audience Member Inga? Lars Bartkuhn Inga Lühning. You will soon find out on the home page when we put up... Umlaut it’s called. Lühning. You have to... Fergus Murphy Question over there. Audience Member What was the name of the album? Lars Bartkuhn The album? It’s called Dreamland. My name and Dreamland. Audience Member I was just curious on the vocal harmonies and stuff like that. How many layers of harmony is that? Lars Bartkuhn I haven’t counted but I think it’s many. I think, yeah, we do a lot of stuff. It’s actually, she’s such a good singer, if you have a bad singer you can’t do so much layers because then you get out of tune. With her you can do a lot of doubling. Like, what’s the word? Adding the same, just the same voice over and over to make this spread effect. It can do unlimited with her, she’s a really good singer. With other singers you can’t do it. If I had to do it I couldn’t do it because it would sound like two different notes at the same time. It was done fast, a day, three hours for the vocals and three hours for the rest, that’s it. It was a quick thing. audience member Can I ask you something else, when you were layering, did you put the music down first and the vocals came in second or the vocals first? Lars Bartkuhn They had a basic sketch. All they had was a bassline and the chorus and then I have two weeks time, I say, “Come in two or three weeks,” and I’ll prepare something and that’s it. They sing on top of it and the instruments play a little bit on top. That’s it. We work together, on some parts I say, “You should do some...” The singer didn’t like some parts of the bass player so we worked together. Audience Member Was it her lyrics that she’s singing or did you write the lyrics? Lars Bartkuhn Yeah. Audience Member She’s the songwriter? Lars Bartkuhn Yeah, but most of all she’s an interpreter of music, singing in a standard quartet, singing pop songs in a jazzy way and all this stuff. She’s also... The band of hers, they always have these albums, like five songs from their own catalog and standards, like pop songs in a completely different way. It’s a good band. audience member How did you get in contact with her? You saw her work, liked it, and decided that that was the sound you wanted on your... Lars Bartkuhn That’s just an old friend. I was playing, when I was coming up first on stage, she was someone I played with. I always wanted to work with her and now I felt ready and she felt ready, so that’s what happened. I’m sure it’s going to come out this year, hopefully. audience member On CD or on vinyl? Lars Bartkuhn No this is a 12”, of course. It’s going to be 12”. Fergus Murphy I think we’re going to have to leave it there because we need everyone back here by ten past three. Lars, thank you very much. [applause]

Title: Hugh Masekela

Hugh Masekela
Hugh Masekela, born near Johannesburg in 1939, grew up immersed in the urban and traditional sounds of South Africa. As the apartheid-era government continued to perform crimes against humanity, Hugh was able to flee South Africa for studies in London and New York. There, he was instrumental in gaining worldwide exposure for the anti-apartheid movement, while studying with folks such as Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Donald Byrd. A horn player and liberation song writer like none other, as he told us during the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, he has stayed adventurous toward music, befriending and recording with artists as diverse as Sly Stone, Fela Kuti, Paul Simon and Bob Marley.
Hosted by Jeff “Chairman” Mao First of all, I mentioned that you obviously covered and incorporated a really diverse range of styles in your music over the time. I’m just wondering why you were able to do that so well? Hugh Masekela Well, I got into music as a child. The first time I saw a gramophone – I don’t know if any of you know what a gramophone is, the thing you wind up for every record – I was fascinated by this box that could bring out all this wonderful sounds, all kinds of varied sounds. And I was about three years old when I insisted that they hold it for me, so that I can wind it up myself and put the needle on the record. So by the time I was five years old, my parents thought that maybe my interest in music was good enough to take piano lessons. So, I got piano lessons and unfortunately for me I’ve been a musician ever since. This is my sixtieth year as a musician and I’m still learning. When you get affected by something you like, it’s not just the final product, I think, that should interest you. It’s how it gets there, you know? Especially today in an age where you press a button and it’s there. I think I was very curious and I followed music into many other things that came with it. It is for that reason that I have never been able in my head to categorize. If I hear a Chinese song from Canton and I like it, I like it because the song is nice and I don’t think, “It’s Chinese.” You know, if I hear something form Timbuktu, I don’t say because it comes from the Sahara desert, it’s deep or something like that. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What sort of records were being played in your household? What sort of music where you being exposed to as a child? Hugh Masekela It wasn’t just my household. Everybody had a gramophone. A gramophone in those days cost 1 pound seven and six. 1 pound seven and six today would probably be... I don’t know how much. [laughs] But people saved up for it. Sometimes for a year, they put a schilling away, until they had 27 schillings. So, two years and some change, right? But everybody had a gramophone and the records cost seven and six. They used to buy maybe two or three every month. They played them on their porches, they just played them loud. And people had radios and Saturday morning from 10 to 10:30 there was what they called the “Bantu program” on the SABC. It was the only program that played African music. And the whole country put on. Like, in town the maids would have it on and their employers would conveniently have gone shopping, but the whole country would ring with that radio program. So, people followed music like sort of en masse and communally and they were obsessed with the songs and the dances that came with them. You just sort of absorbed the music as you went along. But there was like all the music from the area here. Music by the Manhattan Brothers, which is a singing quartet, by the African Ink Spots, which is a singing quartet, the Cuban Brothers, Ace Booja and the Manhattan Stars and then there was orchestras: The Jazz Maniacs, The Harlem Swingsters, Danny Pelizo and his All Star Band, singers like Dolly Rathebe and Dorothy Masuka and small groups like Zakes Nkosi, Elijah Nkwanyana and the Merry Makers. And then there was records from the States. The big bands, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey and, you know, just on and on. All the swing bands like Louis Jordan and His Tympani Five and, of course, Louis Armstrong. [imitates Armstrong’s voice] And everybody tried to like sing some of his songs. And there was Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, there was the Modernaires. And then there was shorts in the movies, you know? Half an hour shorts, sometimes they feature one or two of the bands, sometimes with the Step Brothers or the Nicholas Brothers, who were tap dancers. People in the townships started to emulate, to come up with their versions of that. This is where gumboot dancing came from. You know, they saw movies of people tapping together and thought, “We can do it with the gumboots.” But they actually wear the gumboots, so they can sweep the streets or pick up sanitation. So, it was like a really heavy musical milieu. It wasn’t just music from the records. But it was the churches. All the different churches had their different music. And then people from all, especially if you lived in an urban area like Johannesburg, people from Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the different parts of South Africa on weekends would find a corner and an open field or what and wear their plumage, you know their traditional plumage. And every weekend was like a carnival. And then we just catered street songs. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Is it true that your inspiration to pick up the horn is in part due to Kirk Douglas? Hugh Masekela Well, I finally saw a movie when I was 13. It’s a movie called Young Man With a Horn. The story of Bix Beiderbecke, who was a great trumpet player that died about the age 29 and was from the States. He was one of the greatest improvisers and all that. So, they dramatized it, he was also a big trouble maker, but in the movie he always dances in front of the band and he has the finest, finest threads all the time and he takes all the solos and he doesn’t take shit from anybody and always gets the girl. So, we figured this is the instrument to play... [laughs] and it tend out to be the most difficult instrument. I’m still trying to learn it now. And I never got the girl. Jeff “Chairman” Mao You were also mentored by an individual called Archbishop Trevor Huddleston. Hugh Masekela It wasn’t actually mentored by Archbishop Trevor Huddleston. I don’t know if you ever heard of him? But Trevor Huddleston was an anti-Verwoerd, not even anti-apartheid, but anti-Verwoerd. [Hendrik] Verwoerd was the architect of apartheid in this country. He hated Verwoerd with a passion. And every time I had to go to confessions, he told me, “I got so much hate, but I am a priest, I’m not supposed to have it, so I have to go to confess all the time.” [laughs] But Huddleston was also one of the greatest activists South Africa ever had. When Bantu Education, which was inferior education for African people in this country, was introduced, Huddleston convinced the archbishop of the Anglican diocese to reject it and rather close all the African schools. ‘Cause in those days, all the schools were missionary schools. But Huddleston was interested in restless souls. He always wanted to know, what was driving you and could re-channel your energy into something positive. And finally Huddleston asked me one day, “What do you really want to do?” And I had just seen this movie and I remembered it and said, “Father, if you can just get me a trumpet, I won’t bother anybody anymore.” And he said, “Are you sure?” I said, “I promise you.” So, he send me to Poleax, which was the music store on Eloise Street in those days, to Bob Heal, who was a Scottish bass player with the roughest brogue you ever heard. [impersonates Scottish accent] And he sent me with a note, “Give this poor boy a trumpet. I can only afford 15 pounds.” And Bob Heal said [in Scottish accent again], “Father must be crazy to think you can buy a trumpet for 15 pounds.” But anyway, [laughs] he got me a second-hand trumpet and Huddleston got me a teacher, who was leader of the Johannesburg Municipal Brass Band. Everybody called him Uncle Sauda. And he came and taught me how to play the trumpet. But I was already a piano player, so it didn’t take me too long to find the mechanism; I already knew music. But when I started playing tunes, the other boys got interested and they went to ask Huddleston for instruments. And he started to buy instruments for all of them and soon we had the Huddleston Band. Jeff “Chairman” Mao What was the time frame between that and the Merry Makers of Springs, which was another band you formed, right? Hugh Masekela The Merry Makers, I didn’t form. It was a trumpet player called Elijah Nkwanyna, who I still try to play like. He played in Banzi Bangani’s band and the Merry Makers while I growed up. He was just a fantastic player, an amazing player, and my dream was to really be able to play mbaqanga, which was the township dance band music of those days, kwela. He could play the trumpet and he had the biggest tone and he could sing. And when he sang, the women all used to go [in a high-pitch voice], “Ah, Elijah...” And he only played the trumpet and, “Elijah, whoooo...” He played beautiful. My parents knew the band owner, my uncle was a friend with his son, so he said, “Listen, this kid just started to play.” I think I just picked up the trumpet for two years. “He will play with the band for nothing.” And Elijah and his friend Banzi took me in. ’Cause Elijah, at that time, was always playing the tenor saxophone beautifully, so they needed a third trumpet player. They had another left-handed trumpet player. And I became the third trumpet player in the Merry Makers. And that is where I cut my teeth. I was the envy of all people my age. “He is playing with the Merry Makers!” And when I went back to school, to boarding school, after the holidays, I taught the band some of the arrangements of the Merry Makers. I just finished this book that I wrote about my life and I’m giving it all away here. [laughter] And Huddleston went to America and he met Louis Armstrong. He told Louis Armstrong about the band and Louis Armstrong sent us a trumpet – one of his own trumpets. We were in the news. In those days, African people, you never saw them on the front page in the newspaper. Mostly, we were on the crime list on page nine. [laughs] So, for that whole year, every magazine and every book wanted us, and that brought us to the forefront. We became sort of part of the music community in this country. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Tell us a little bit about getting first to London and then to New York. Hugh Masekela When Huddleston finally got me papers to get out of town, Johnny Dankworth, who was a great English jazz band leader, had been here. And he was deported, when they found out that he was married to a Jamaican woman of African blood by the name of Cleo Lane. Yehudi Menuhin also came here. He was deported for hobnobbing with the natives. Huddleston hooked up with them because at that time he was like setting up the anti-apartheid movement overseas. And they started becoming very big activists and activism organizers. And he got them to get me a letter from the Guildhall School of Music to say that they accepted me. With that, I was able to get my passport. Jeff “Chairman” Mao And you got to New York also through some sponsors? Hugh Masekela I’ve grown up, way and around Miriam Makeba, you know, we were very close. When I was in England, it was 1960 and she had really like broken out big in the States. She was on first name basis with everybody from Louis Armstrong to Duke Ellington to Ella Fitzgerald to Miles Davis. Harry Belafonte had taken her under her wing and taught her, but she was like the toast of America. But she needed some help with the music and she knew how much I hankered to get like a music education. So, she organized Belafonte and Dizzy Gillespie, John Mehegan, Miles Davis and a few other people to sponsor me. With her help also in the school, I ended up in September 1960 in the Manhattan School of Music – with the help of all those people. I think that between Harry Belafonte and Miriam Makeba, I got so much generosity that it inspired me to sort of vindicate their belief in me, you know? By the time I was in my second year of school, I had record offers because I played on Miriam’s second album a muted trumpet on three of the songs. And they were the most played songs on that album and then word got around and I got a record contract and, of course, the rest became history as time went on. Jeff “Chairman” Mao Did you consider coming back, after you graduated? Hugh Masekela Yeah, in 1963. I mean, I just was fired up, I had all the knowledge that I wanted and I was playing great and I wanted to become a teacher back in South Africa. I went as far as England. I nearly came back. Harry Belafonte and Miriam Makeba, but especially Belafonte said, “With a mouth like yours, you’re not gonna get too far in South Africa now. Mandela has been sentenced to death, all your friends are leaving the country, and a lot of them are getting killed. You go in there with your kind of mouth and your kind of disposition and they gonna nail you. And nobody knows you. So, you not gonna make it and if they kill you, nobody is gonna know and after a week or two, it will be forgotten about. But if you stay [in America] and try to make a name for yourself, and talk about your country the way you feel, you will have access to the media and you will be able to pass the word around on behalf of the sufferings of the people back there. You will be able to do it through songs, etc.” And I remember I said to him, “But Harry. How do I know I’m gonna make a name?” And he said, “Man, we can’t give you everything. We are on your side, ain’t that enough for you?” So, it’s very important for me in the rest of my life, to give back. I don’t think that I’m gonna ever be able to pay back what was done for me because a lot of people helped me. And if you don’t give, I guess, you don’t get. Miles Davis pulled me aside one day and said [imitates Miles’ hoarse voice], “Listen man, let me tell you something, you wanna be a jazz musician? There is thousands of us. You just will be a statistic. But if you put some of that shit of your home into the shit you're doing...” – every other word with Miles was shit – “...and you put some of the shit you doing home into the shit you’re doing now, your shit is gonna be mad and mean, you know? You gonna be bad. And then we gonna learn something from you, you know? Something we don’t know.” And I said, “Are you sure?” “Yes, man, because this way you gonna be just a motherfucking sideman the rest of your life.” So, as soon as I got my memory back again and started like zoning in on into townships and township flavored music, everybody paid attention, and I got a deal with MGM. My first successful record was called The Americanization of Ooga Booga. [laughs] Jeff “Chairman” Mao You’ve been back for 13 years now? Is that correct? What is your impression of how things are now in this country? Hugh Masekela Well, from the perspective of an artist, this was a very isolated country, artistically speaking. Although we had all the wherewithal materially to have been able to do these kind of things, to build this kind of institutions of information, the arts were always suspect in South Africa. For the last government, the arts were used basically to say, “How can you say we are so bad when we have Miriam Makeba and Abdullah Ibrahim and all those people and they can talk about us as much as they want.” It wasn’t like something that was nurtured. And then the arts business... I mean, this country, for the infrastructure it has, and the audience it has, should have by now a very, very big independent entertainment industry. But it really doesn’t exist. Whatever exists is sort of not really indigenous, it’s a wannabe, an imitation of other countries. And yet our resources in South Africa and in Africa, but especially here, are so diverse, you know? We have such a rich history and a cross section of so much wealth and so much different kinds of people and music and sounds and so many stories. It is a country of 350 years of endless wars. It’s a country where there was so much suffering. A very beautiful country. A country with very funny people, very generous people, who were forced because there is so much mutual admiration for each other, they were forced not to, legislatively. The damage that was done to us by apartheid in other words, is that it sort of limited our adventurism into who we are, into ourselves and what we have here. It does not disturb me, but the element that I’m most obsessed with, is the element that I wish every creative person, to try and extract value from. I wouldn’t call it a renaissance, it’s a revival, but it’s not gonna be done through talking and, of course it has to be done through funding. There’s no revival without funding because a lot of funding was put into destroying the fabric that we were before we were forced into isolating. Isolating ourselves from each other and also like being isolated from the world. So, a lot of funds and effort has to be put back and I think it’s up to the youth of the future of this country to open that window because it’s one of the richest windows in this world. You know, the world is very, very keen to know who we are. And we are not telling them, you know? We can tell them entertainingly. When people come here they miss the people because the people haven’t showed them who they are and they go for the animals. ’Cause they can’t find the people, they go for the big five. [laughs] But if they knew where we were, they would come and find us. But we have to do it. So, it’s a thing that will happen. I know, I have been philosophical, but in reality that is how it is. You know, in the past we have subconsciously lost our self-esteem. We think we are not good enough. But believe me, to a great extent we are winners in almost everything we are going to try because we have a major drive and passion. We have a background that is richer than most people that come from most countries. And we have to take advantage of that. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have made it as far as I have. Audience Member I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about how songs come to you. That whole process of creation. Hugh Masekela I think that any artist’s best work, this is my crazy notion, their best work is not originated by themselves. I think, there is some kind of spiritual, some conscious mode, you put yourself in so as to receive. Because none of us are original. Like my grandmother said, “We didn’t come here with anything.” The less you think that you know, the better you can receive and the more enthusiastic you can be about what you don’t know. The most popular songs I have ever done, like “Bring Back Nelson Mandela,” I know I didn’t write. I was in Botswana in 1985 and Mandela wrote me from Paulsmore Prison a birthday card on April 4th. Because Winnie Mandela worked as a social worker, she did have field work under my mother in Arizona township. So, she knew us from that time. When she went to visit Mandela, she told him what I do overseas and in Botswana and what my sister was doing. And being the crazy nut that he was in corresponding with everybody, he sent me a birthday card. And it ended with, he knew all the music stuff. And he said, “Keep up the good work. Good luck.” And I’m saying, “Here is a guy who’s in jail and he’s encouraging me, who is outside. That’s not even generous, it’s weird.” [laughter] And it made me feel so bad for him that I just started crying and I went to the piano and started singing this song word for word and it just came. I would say he sent it to me, or he opened me up for it, to be sent in. The same thing with “Coal Train.” When I was four, five, six years old, I lived in a coal mining town at my grandmothers cabin. I talked to the people from the mine who came there to drink, and they tell me about the conditions, like my father had been in the mines and I saw the conditions that they lived in. You know, in the hostels and all that. And then 30 years later at a party up in Woodstock, and having a great time and all of a sudden I had to rush to the piano. I get to the piano and I start singing “Stimela,” just as it is. My friends are going, “When did you write this song?” And I say, “Shhh, it’s coming in, so shut the fuck up!” [laughs] Audience Member It’s quite an honor to have you around here, I’d like to say that. I just wanted to find out your take on young producers doing remixes of your music. Not necessarily you, but everyone who is like from way back. So, I just wanted to know, how you feel about that, us guys remixing your stuff? Hugh Masekela Fortunately, because I don’t even think it’s mine – when people say, “I love your music.” I say, “It’s not even mine because my grandmother is haunting me.” It’s not my music, I found it here. You know, we don’t come with nothing here. And whatever is happening to me is like supposed to happen. It’s not a bad thing. I would be worrying if you all were beating each other with your guitars on the head. That would be bad. But if that [remixing] is happening, it would be great because I, too, imitated other people. And I still try to play like Elijah Nkwanyna. Art is for sharing. If you find any artist and they use the word “this is my,” you know, already there is a problem there. Because there is nothing anybody can say is theirs. You know, even Einstein tried to explain that with his theory of relativity, but people said he is a genius. He said, “I found it here.” If you look at a group like Mafikizolo, they are doing original music of theirs, but they sound like they come from the 1940s. Their sound. But you know, with a group like that, you immediately know, it’s not their fault. They are sent. They don’t know, they’re just mediums. Audience Member What do you think about the late stuff Miles Davis started to do in like early ’70s, this electronic stuff? People thought it was wack because it was too futuristic for them. Hugh Masekela All I can say is, that it was sent to him. That is all I can say. Participant But did you like it? Hugh Masekela I liked some of it. The thing is, I used to be always there when Miles played. He used to play at the Village Vanguard all the time and I been there almost every day. He was complaining to me, when I started recording [imitates Davis], “You are stealing my shit.” [chuckles] Whenever I came to the club, he said, “I know, what you here for, my brother.” But I followed him everywhere, you know? Because he was an amazing player. And then when he changed, his first album was [In A] Silent [Way] and then he did Bitches Brew. By then he was also doing mostly concerts. Also, when he had like the Herbie Hancock trio and that quintet, with Wayne Shorter and them, his stuff was changing. He said to me, “I don’t see you much around anymore?” I said, “I’m working.” He said, “You are full of shit. You are just like all the other people. You don’t like what I’m doing, but I don’t give a shit.” But that was Miles Davis. And he had a bigger following when he played that stuff than ever before. Because then he became great friends with Jimi Hendrix and those people. He did some amazing stuff. Things like Jack Johnson – that album. He did some amazing things and some things that were difficult for me to understand. But I don’t dislike anything. When it doesn’t get me, I don’t play it, I don’t go listen to it. Audience Member Do you admire any of the young producers or musicians out there? Is there anyone, you admire doing their thing today? Hugh Masekela That I admire? Audience Member Yeah, production-wise. Hugh Masekela How much time do you have? Audience Member OK, who is one of your favorites then? Hugh Masekela It depends on the week. Audience Member This week! Hugh Masekela This week in my car, I am playing Zizi Congo, Salif Keita, his new album. I’m playing The Best of Marvin Gaye. Every time, I hear his voice, I shake my head. And I’ve got Louis Armstrong with Jack Teagarden, they used to do all those duos. And I have got Mafikizolo. On their new album, I just did a duet with them about “Here Come the Police.” And we co-wrote the song and that is the fifth album. The sixth record I got is Gilberto Gil’s new album. He is an old friend. But I change my records every week. Sometimes I listen to classical music, sometimes I play Eastern music. Some of my most favorite music is Gregorian chants. I mean, the harmonies! I went to Tbilisi in Georgia and in every church 24 hours a day there are Gregorian singers just singing around the clock. And the harmony and the purity of their voices is just amazing.

J Da Flex
Before J Da Flex got his spot behind the decks, he was flexin’ selector duties for a DJ mate in Huddersfield. As he tells us direct from the 2003 Red Bull Music Academy, it didn’t take him long to step things up a notch. Pretty soon his healthy appetite for fresh tunes earned him heavyweight status in the London pirates, allowing him to break onto 1Xtra with his show Underground Knowledge shortly after setting up the influential label Ghost. At one point it seemed like everyone was looking for a piece of the pie – but J cautions that you need to have substance to come back for seconds.
Hosted by J DA FLEX My name’s J Da Flex. People often ask me, "Where does that name come from?" It was the first name I thought of after listening to people like Karl “Tuff Enuff” Brown and Matt “Jam” Lamont. It just seemed to be the in thing to have something linking your name to ... I don’t know, the way you might work the decks. That was pretty much it for me. For me, it was J Da Flex, and I thought, “You know, that works.” It had a ring to it, and it was a Matt “Jam” Lamont, it was like a Karl “Tuff Enuff” Brown. It had a ring to it, so I stuck to it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT There's a lot of confusion going on regarding names and labels and all that kind of stuff. How would you call the music you are playing these days, or what is the stuff we're going to talk about? J DA FLEX It comes under the umbrella of garage, and that's the root of the music. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Are we talking New Jersey deep garage? J DA FLEX No, we're talking UK garage. It originated from the US dubs. The b-sides, really. UK cats got involved involved it. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When was that? J DA FLEX I got involved in this kind of music back in ’95, ’94-’95. I lived in a small place called Huddersfield, and I was hanging about with a guy called Andy Jay. He was the main local DJ in that small town, and I was hanging about with him and had no real intention of being a DJ. I was just kind of in it for the music. I really enjoyed the music at that point. Going to the parties, it was more of a “vibes” thing for me. Living in Huddersfield, I didn't really know much about the scene. Andy Jay was my closest link to the music scene coming from London. Hanging about with him, I'd go to record shops with him. We traveled to Huddersfield, we traveled to Leeds, Manchester as well, going to the record shops. I was more of a listener, more of a punter. He was a DJ obviously. I was a punter. And I’d help him choose tracks, which he and I thought were kind of best suited for the dance floors, basically. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So, you were the selector and he was the technician? J DA FLEX Something like that, but I didn't get paid for it, unfortunately. As my curiosity increased, I wanted to attempt at being a DJ. My first attempt was when Andy was doing a mix CD for other promotions that he wanted to get involved in for other clubs. After he had finished his mix, I had asked him if I could have a mix and he showed me a few tricks. It kind of went from there, really. That's where my journey started back in '95. TORSTEN SCHMIDT You said it was all about the dubs and the US dubs. What kind of records are we talking there? J DA FLEX We're talking the B-sides of Masters at Work, Francois K, Louie Vega, people like that. They would have a vocal side, which should probably be the A-side on that. The dubs would be obviously on the B-side. I originated from the drum & bass scene. I was very much kind of hip-hop, then drum & bass and my roots were very dub-y. Very music-orientated as opposed to vocal-orientated. My ears twitched at the sound of a good beat or a good bassline. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So you weren’t into the big diva thing at all? J DA FLEX Not really. I wasn’t opposed to it. I enjoyed a good sing-a-long every now and then, but I was more beat-orientated. That's what really drove me. This is one of the first tracks that got me interested in the scene. (music: Unknown) That’s just a general idea of the kind of music that got me involved in DJing. Very dub-orientated, beat-orientated, no vocals at all. And at that time, the scene was very drug-orientated. It wasn’t much about drinking alcohol and whatever, having a good time. Back when I was young, it was more of a case of you doing your drugs, you’re getting into the party vibe. That’s pretty much where it started for me. I’m a clean boy now. (music: Louie Vega - Unknown) For this type of music, when it started, there was a lot of imports, a lot of stuff coming from America. As a lot of the UK producers got involved and got into the studios, there was no need for the UPS shippings. A lot of people would go to local distributors, hand over like 500 records to a distributor and a distributor would probably come around into the record shops. Or you’d press up 500 copies yourself and you do your own footwork. So there was no particular best day to come into a record shop because you might have a producer coming in on Monday having this fresh track or you might have him coming in on Friday. So, if you were eager and wanted fresh music, you’d be there every other day, every three days or whatever. Or some people just stick to the weekend. Going out to the record shops on the weekend. At the time there was Release the Groove in Soho, there was Flying Records in Soho. There’s Black Market Records in Soho, and there was Uptown Records. And you just circulate these shops in central London and you’d have Criminal Records in East London. You’d have various shops, so if you are hungry for it and you wanted the fresh music, you’d have to take a proper day out and travel the whole of London to get all the music. And I guess that’s what helps to build your name on a pirate station. You can’t just get onto a pirate station and play the same 10,000 tracks that everyone else is playing. You’ve got to be making an effort or get in contact with the producers or loitering in the shops, like what I’ve done. I got to the stage where I was calling the numbers on the labels to bug the producers to see if I could get exclusives, and that’s exactly how you made your name on a radio. I started off on a station, and I’d done the graveyard shift, which is 4 to 6 in the morning. Soon after the manager realized that I was getting a lot of exclusive music, then you progress to a more recognizable spot on the radio, and that’s where you begin to build your name on the radio. In London, it’s not just the garage scene or the hip-hop scene. It’s all genres of music. There’s a big pirate scene in London. You could flick from one end of the FM dial to the other end of the FM dial, and you could find in a region maybe 20 pirate stations. You could drive around London and see the state blocks and see antennas. It’s a real big thing. It was then and it still is now. TORSTEN SCHMIDT How did you find your way into pirates? J DA FLEX I got involved in the pirate thing when I moved down to London in ’97 just after I got my job in the record shop. A friend of mine, locally, told me that there was a pirate station. I tuned into the frequency of the pirate station, and the DJ at the time, he must have been giving out the number for shouts and requests. And I called up the number, and I asked to speak to the station manager and that’s how I got in basically. I spoke to the station manager and said, “Look, I’m interested in DJing.” You have to do a lot of namedropping, but without trying to be arrogant or being too cocky at the same time. I mean, I’ve done a bit of namedropping, said I knew this person, that person, whatever. And he had time for me. I gave him my demo, and he gave me that 4 to 6 spot, which was my starting point. TORSTEN SCHMIDT When you speak about name dropping and pirates, can you enlighten us about the importance or non-importance of the MC and all this “Shoutout to the milkman” business? J Da Flex Back at that time, the MC wasn’t such a big deal. The MC was more… his job was to help the DJ. You know, crowd participation, get people involved. It was more of a sidekick thing. Whereas now, the MCs, they’re kind of an entity within themselves. They’re just doing their thing. It’s completely different now to what it was then. (music: Tuff Jam – unknown) J DA FLEX If you want to be the best at what you are doing, you’ve got to be prepared to go that step further to get the extra record that that person hasn’t got or to make the extra contact so you could play in that particular gig. That’s all it is. It’s no kind of, “I’ll kill you for that spot.” It’s not like going to a war. It’s just a case of you want to be the best at what you are doing. AUDIENCE MEMBER I’m just curious to know how the music that you are playing is now, which is obviously what you started out listening to, how it mutated into the sound that is now called garage. J DA FLEX I will get to that, I’ve got a couple of examples. I mean, it started out very soulful as you know. And there was a collaboration with a guy call ed M.J. Cole and Ramsey & Fen. This is one of the tracks for me which started to change the sound of the scene. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Already we got a little bit of a post drum & bass sneaking in. J DA FLEX Yeah, that’s what it was. You’ve got the progressions in the sounds and the basslines. I’ve got a perfect example of where the scene actually changed. With this track, a guy called DJ Zinc he started producing what he didn’t like to call garage. It was more of a slowed down drum & bass that he was doing. (music: DJ Zinc – “138 Trek”) TORSTEN SCHMIDT On the label, we got part of the dilemma already. There were a lot of people coming to London, living in London, listening to tracks like this and they are freakin’ out, like, "Where can I get it?" J DA FLEX Exactly. I was in Baltimore, like five weeks ago and I’m still getting people asking me, "Where did you get these breaks from?" It’s still very UK-orientated. You’ve got a lot of people around the world making breakbeat, making techno, but I think what we are doing in London is still slightly different to what everyone else is doing. TORSTEN SCHMIDT But not only the whole exclusivity thing. I mean, you’ve got a VIP mix. Everyone has been playing that, and you are just like, "I want that track." How long did it take for people to get that one? Ages! J DA FLEX Obviously, if you’re working in a record shop – and at that time, I had made my links with various producers, various record labels – you’d get hooked up. And I think I had this [track] maybe eight weeks before it hit the road. And that was just an advantage, a perk of working in a record shop: you get everything first. This was a landmark tune. After this tune was released, the whole scene changed. Then you had people like Zed Bias making tracks. [switching the record] He was coming from the drum & bass era. And he also got involved in making UK garage or 2step. That’s what it was called at the time. 4Hero, Bugz in the Attic, them boyz ... they’re broken beat. They’re more future jazz, future London jazz. A lot of stuff that I play on the radio now is, I kinda like to go across the board. I play some old school where I’m coming from. I play some current, and I like to kind of, educate. My show is called Underground Knowledge. It’s where I get to educate people. I’m completely different from where Tim might be coming from. He’s already made his name. And 1Xtra is a new radio station. The beauty about 1Xtra is the fact that all the DJs involved in 1Xtra are pirate DJs. We’re all coming straight from pirate stations, and we have all just been given this opportunity to play on legal radio. TORSTEN SCHMIDT So you’re the Corleone family in Godfather 2? Now you’re all getting lectured and trying to get it sorted out? J DA FLEX It was just a perfect opportunity, and like I said, all the DJs on the station are coming from pirate level. And that’s where the hunger, the enthusiasm is. When they were looking for DJs for 1Xtra, they didn’t want any real established DJs. They didn’t want anyone who’d already made their name famous for any scene or genre that they were involved in. I guess it was a hunger thing. Because if you are given the opportunity to play on a legal station coming from a pirate, you're still going to have that same pirate hunger. Whereas, I’m still going out there looking for the best tracks. There are three other shows on 1Xtra and I’m always trying to be the best garage show. The hunger is still there for me. I’m still grafting, still calling at the people, calling labels on the records and just pestering people for new tracks. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Obviously, when you get all these people taken away from the pirates, there must be a lot of hungry kids moving into their spots which are left void now? J DA FLEX I mean, there’s always someone who wants to take your spot. So when you leave the pirate station, there’s always someone who is hungry to fill your shoes on the pirate station. And one thing that we were told on 1Xtra was, “Don’t get too complacent. Although you are on a national radio station now, don’t be complacent. Because as fast as you’re employed is as quick as you be dropped if you become complacent if you are not on the top of your game.” I had a chat with the boss, and basically, it was in case of everyone who was employed on 1xtra, they were an authority figure in their genre. And at that point, just before I was going to 1Xtra, I ran a record label called Ghost. We were kind of innovators. We completely changed the sound again, because there was a whole vocal side of garage, and as I was coming from drum & bass, as I mentioned earlier, we were bringing the drum & bass basslines in there as well. Our sound was very minimal. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Got any examples of that? J DA FLEX This is one of my first releases on my label Ghost. (music: Ghost – “The Club”) That was the first side. It was called “At the Club.” That was done by Blaze. The next track is called “Two Thousand.” (music: Ghost – “Two Thousand”) TORSTEN SCHMIDT Compared to the earlier stuff, we lost a beat or two in the pattern? J DA FLEX Yeah, definitely. It went from a 4/4 beat, which is your house structure, to a 2-step. It actually came from a track by Tina Moore. I can’t remember the name of the guy who produced the track, but that was actually a US track. It moved away from the 4/4 structure and had this 2-step vibe to it. It was like a full vocal, and I think that’s where the 2-step sound was coming from. Although they might claim for it to be from London, I think that was the first track Tina Moore, “Never Let You Go” in which I heard a 2-step beat. That’s where the whole 2-step derived from in my opinion. It just changed the scene. It went from a 4/4 dubby vocal to your complete dubs, your RIPs were making all the heavy basslines, the Reese basslines, the drum & bass basslines to M.J. Cole doing his thing and then the 2-step. The scene was kind of forking off all the time. People kind of being creative in their own right and just trying to make something completely different. Where we came in, we were doing a 2-step thing, but with drum & bass bass sounds just doing something completely different to what anyone else was doing. (music: Ghost – unknown) It was just a case of experimenting in the studios, basically. We'd lay down a 2-step beat, and we just tried to find the most ridiculous, the dirtiest, the hardest bassline we could. That’s where the label came from, that’s where Ghost came from, and that’s where we really made our name. Not for trying to do what anyone else is doing at the time. That was fresh. We’ve done that back in 2000 and there was no one doing anything like that at the time. So that’s where we started to build our name. TORSTEN SCHMIDT By that time, with the particular situation in London with all the labels, all the media and stuff, the second time around you had a lot of public attention put on your scene with the weirdest stereotypes. How do you survive all these ups and downs, like, "Hey, we all love you, we want to sign you, we want to give you a free house, a free car or whatever?" And then, two weeks later, "No, you are rubbish." J DA FLEX I think the media and the record companies really, they mess up your scene. You start with something which is fresh, and over time, it becomes more mainstream. And when it becomes more mainstream, obviously you get a load of press, and record companies wanna get involved in it. At that point, that was the start of the end of the scene, basically. Where major companies would start throwing £60 thousand or £120 thousand at you for a single. Not an album deal, but a single deal. For one 12" they would give you like 120 grand. And kids want money. There were people that wasn’t even making this type of music, and they caught wind that the record companies were throwing this ridiculous amount of money at you for doing a 12". Everyone was making it. It wore it right down. You lost the real essence of the underground with it becoming more mainstream. You’d hear tracks on washing up liquid-adverts and things like that. From when you switch on the TV and hear tracks on dry commercials then you know your scene is in trouble. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Are there any songs you played on white label you regret having played? J DA FLEX That’s a good question, actually. As a working, up-and-coming DJ, if you wanted to get gigs, you had to play what the crowd wanted. There were certain clubs I played out that I’d have a cheesy box where I played tracks I didn’t really want to play. That cheesy box would actually come out. Yes, there were a number of tracks I’ve played that I didn’t particularly want to play, but at the end of the day, it’s a case of trying to make a name for yourself as well. TORSTEN SCHMIDT A cheesy name then? J DA FLEX Not really a cheesy name. I use the opportunity. I might play one or two cheesy tracks, and then I draw for something. TORSTEN SCHMIDT Are you probably just afraid to admit that you liked Craig David at some stage? J DA FLEX Craig David? Shit, he’s talented, right? He was a talented guy. That’s why he broke through. Even people like Daniel Bedingfield. His first track was a garage track. If you are talented, you go a long way, and I respect that more than anyone who’s coming in just for the money.

Title: Jean-Michel Jarre & Laurie Anderson

Jean-Michel Jarre & Laurie Anderson
In the immediate aftermath of the devastating attacks in Paris, the Red Bull Music Academy and two of its lecturer guests, Jean-Michel Jarre and Laurie Anderson, decided to sit down on the couch to discuss music and its role in uncertain times. Having been friends and collaborators for decades, Jarre and Anderson’s understanding of each others’ work and ideas weaves this lecture together with realism, wisdom and humor.
Although they sit on the couch casually, and as equals, Jarre and Anderson have had globally acclaimed careers that have spanned music, art and performance since the 1970s. When you look at the current landscape of live electronic music performance, everyone from EDM superstars to underground techno DJs owe a huge debt to Jarre’s vision.
Anderson has always had a lot of fun playing with people’s perceptions of what a music piece could be, including early experiments with samplers and invented electronic instruments. Originally a sculptor before she started crafting her unique soundscapes, her calm, syncopated delivery conjures all manner of tripped-out dream imagery – evocative and vague enough to qualify as fully-blown artistic statements.
Hosted by Todd L. Burns Thank you all for coming here. We have a very, very special situation today. Through happenstance we have not one but two amazing electronic pioneers, legends, etc… with us on the couch, and we thought it would be great to have them talk a little bit about their careers, and also their collaborations over the years. Please help me welcoming Laurie Anderson and Jean-Michel Jarre. First of all, thank you so much for coming. I guess, why did you guys feel like it was important to be here today, of all days, to come in and talk? I mean, given the circumstances of what’s happened in the city. Jean-Michel Jarre Yes, much better. Yes, I was just saying that as a French citizen, I should maybe start by saying that I wanted to be here just to actually be together today, because actually, apart from what happened in the past few hours here in this country…I mean, all of you, and partly your organization, put a lot of energy and effort to welcome lots of artists, young producers and people obsessed, I would say, interested, excited by music, and electronic music, technology, and so on, and we are facing the fact that everything has to be cancelled as a consequence of this really tragic event. I just would like to say that I’m obviously especially moved by the fact that I lost also some people, we lost some people we knew very well. I mean, some sound engineers, and it’s also hitting our community, and not only our community as musicians, but also as everyone on the planet needs music, loves music. This particular terrorist act also hit a generation, your generation, and also hit at the people just there for the love of music. I think it was really appropriate for us just to be together and talking about what it would be like, and about music in the most free way. I would like to say also something more general about this. It’s actually… we kill people, I mean, they kill us, and this is the kind of blood-for-blood situation, it’s a waste of energy, and it’s a very sad day beyond what happened. This kind of situation is just…it’s probably the first time that we are all… our generation is confronted with this kind of war zone in Paris. I was in the studio on Friday night until 5:00 in the morning. I was recording something someplace in Paris, and when I went back home, it was around 4:30 in the morning, and it was like something… we never knew, like, being really in a kind of war zone where – probably you were maybe around during that night – and it was like this whole town being absolutely silent with lots of police cars, but with no noise. It was silent, and lots of activities like this, with the police and the army, and people going all over the place, and it was very strange, and I think that even in an audio point of view it was frightening. Here we are and, anyway, thank you for the Red Bull Academy to welcome such a great event in Paris, and we hope to see you soon again here in this town. Todd L. Burns Thank you. Laurie, after the September 11th attacks in New York, you did a live album – or you did a live concert, rather, almost a week afterwards, and it was one of the first kind of major cultural happenings in the city, almost. Can you talk about that experience, and why you felt like at the time also that was such an important thing? Laurie Anderson Sure. First of all, I am so happy to see you all here. I’m really glad that circumstances have put us in the same room, because these moments are just so incredible, and when everything breaks you have this incredible opportunity to look at things, and often, life doesn’t give you that break. I hope that we can, this afternoon, talk about that and really want to hear your ideas on it, because I actually, really, I learned a lot 15 years ago when that happened in New York, and… we blew it. We had this opportunity just for a little moment to do certain things very differently. Instead we chose revenge, and we chose to start rattling the sabers, and that was a huge mistake. Where we are today is part of the results of that approach to the world. I was always afraid of this for so many years. I used to talk about it with other musicians, like, why doesn’t this ever happen in concerts? It’s this kind of secret fear of musicians, like, why are we immune to this? In the United States we have a lot of this all the time. We have it in movie theaters, we never had it in concerts, but we have these guys, and we have guns, and we use them all the time, and there are a lot of really crazy people who come in to movie theaters and they just…and you watch the watersheds being…the marks being crossed, the lines being crossed. By that I mean, you think, “Oh. That’s just so terrible, we should stop this.” Then we had, last year, we had a gunman…two years ago, into a grade school and he killed all the little children in the school. And you think, “OK, it’s going to be over now. Gun control; are we finished?” No. In fact, what we did was we said, “OK, we can tolerate that. We can tolerate that, for the freedom we have of arming ourselves.” At that point, I thought, this is, we can’t say anything more. If it’s okay, if you come in and kill a lot of little children, and that’s okay with you, then you’ve really crossed a line. It’s really important to me, to think now, of what artists and musicians can do, because this is the first time that this has happened in our own place, in our own place, in a concert hall, in a club. What I hope to do in the next couple hours is hear some of your ideas about you feel about it, if there’s a response that you think you would like to make as a musician, as someone in the world of music. Do you have a responsibility now, or no? Or do you have none? Do you have no responsibility, or do you have one? This is what I hope to explore, and I think that, in New York I know we tried so hard to make a response to this, but as you know, people just close their doors, and they go “Oh, I’m afraid,” and things keep happening, and so people are afraid. OK, and it’s dark, our planes didn’t fly, for me the neighborhood was, I live right next to, a few blocks from there, and so for me it was a year of real insanity, of the big hole in the city, and all the tumult, but what struck me the most was the moment when you have a little opportunity to say, like a detective, “Why did this happen? Let’s see why, why did this happen?” Instead of immediately, “I’m going to get them.” You stop for a second, and you say, “What in the situation created this event?” If you are curious, if you are not, and if you are just, well, wipe it away, many people did that, and I thought that was a huge mistake. Problems are interesting. One of the things I learned in the studio from… [to Jean-Michel] Did you ever work with Brian Eno in the studio? Jean-Michel Jarre Yes. Laurie Anderson Yeah? OK, so you probably … Yeah, so you probably had a similar experience, I bet. This is a really wonderful thing, and whenever we had a problem with a piece of music, or with an approach, or with a piece of technology, Brian would get so happy. He was like, “No problem. Great!” He cheered up immediately, it was amazing, everyone else was like, “How are we going to do this, it’s not working, or it’s a terrible song,” or it’s a whatever, and he was immediately laughing and happy because it’s a chance to change your ideas. To change the way you are trying to do it, because you can’t keep hammering at something, it’s going to fall into pieces, you are going to break it if you keep hammering and it’s not going to work. You get to get to go, “Oh, why is that not working?” And you get to try to fix it in a whole another way. These are moments that don’t come up so often, where everything breaks, and everyone is going, “Oh.” And this is the moment to open your eyes and go, “OK, why is this happening? Why is this happening? Then what do we do, if anything?” I’m not saying it’s necessary to do anything. Just necessary, I think, to look at it. The concert that I did shortly afterwards was also the first time a lot of people came out of their houses in New York after this, and I was singing some songs that I hadn’t done for a while, and people are like, “How did you write those songs for this situation?” The thing is that this particular conflict we are in now, and we were experiencing Friday night, has been going on for three decades, and I was writing about then, and it hasn’t really changed. It’s just gotten different names, and it’s been labeled in different ways, but it is the conflict between East and West, in various guises of Afghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East, and it’s the same thing. Todd L. Burns It’s interesting how songs that you’ve done take on new resonances, 20, 30 years down the road. Jean-Michel, I mean, I wonder if there’s music that you’ve made that you hear in completely different ways than when you’ve made it originally, looking back at your stuff? Jean-Michel Jarre I don’t know. I suppose that’s our job as musicians, is to make the air vibrating. It’s very invisible, and it could be pathetic in a sense, because it’s just invisible, nobody sees this, and the way you are making the air vibrating you can create boredom, or people who want to have sex, or dancing, or moving their bodies until the end of the night, or fully in tears, and sometimes it’s the same music which could also create this. I would like to come back to what you said, Laurie, about two things. About the notion of accident, that we all know how important it is in our jobs, in our day-to-day work, and something like what happened in this town, I mean two days ago, it’s a major accident, so how can we…how can we use it positively in something interesting; or not, as you were saying? This is something I really would like you to react on also, to get also your feedback because it’s just a discussion with friends here. We would like, really, to hear also your reactions. The second thing is also, when all this happened, I thought about my mom. My mom was a great figure in the French Resistance, and she told me about the idea that when society is generating things that you can’t accept, somebody has to stand up, and not saying “Stop” necessarily, but saying, “Think about it. Be aware.” The reason why I have, for instance, lots of respect for somebody like Edward Snowden, because in a sense, it’s exactly what he’s doing, and we should think about this kind of attitude towards this. In the art of war, people are saying that you, I mean, to fight an enemy you must understand him, and I think we never…I mean, as the Western world, never asked this question. We never ask this question to ourselves: “Why these people are doing this?” Beyond the fact that you just said on CNN, you hear every CNN or news channels, you hear, “OK. They are barbarians. OK, that need to be shot.” What does it mean, being a barbarian? You know that the line between a terrorist and a resistant is very fragile, so we should also understand this; we should also try to understand the reason why, and then fighting for the good reason, for the right reasons, and to know exactly what we are fighting for or against. This is something that, obviously, can be triggered, what I’m saying, and what you are saying, by what we do as musicians. I think music is, when you think that these people are saying that they wanted to hit this club, and to hit people listening to music and doing music because music is not allowed in their systems, these crazy people, that you should try to understand why are they saying this, because it could be even the source of inspiration for songs, and I think we have not…we are very lazy, as the Western world is very cynical, very arrogant and very lazy, and we are not thinking enough about this kind of; “What’s going on, on the other side, in their minds?” They are human beings like you and us, and we should really think about it, and this is the kind of accident that we can turn like in judo, I mean, taking the weakness of the moment, the weak moments, and transforming it in strong moments. As we do in studios, by actually using accident as an advantage. What if we could use this tragedy to our advantage? Todd L. Burns You make a good point about language, and the way that it’s used, and to different ends. Do you feel like the language has changed? I mean, you’ve said that the names might be different, but is the way that we talk about it changed recently, in the 15 years, do you feel like? Laurie Anderson I don’t think so, because you can still sling around the word, you can just say “terrorist” and that will be the end of that person, and to use that phrase. I mean, I notice how many people have gotten that in their vocabulary, thinking of Putin, for example, who was talking about Chechnya, and he suddenly calls them, they are suddenly terrorists, as opposed to his enemies. And as soon as you say that word, then it changes the game. I think language is really important, but what you are saying, too, about understanding motivation, I think it’s very important for artists and musicians to look at the situation and ask what the motivation is, because I think labeling things is awfully easy to do, and we live in a corporate culture in which labeling, and basically profiling is the way we do things, it’s the way we market everything. It’s the way we market ourselves, it’s the way we define things in very quick terms, and here is a stupid example. You get a book on Amazon, and ping, two seconds later it goes, “Bill, you like that book, you are going to like this book too.” Then you have to say, “Wait a second, do you know that first book I just bought, that was a gift. Don’t think you know me by what I just bought. Don’t put your little frame around me and pretend that you know what I want, and what I’m getting, and what I’m interested in.” That’s the way we do things in our culture now, so with these very simplistic, very tweetable terms that are just, they don’t have any nuance in them. Suddenly, some gunmen who are…who knows what’s going through these guys minds as they are blowing these people away in the club, what are they thinking? Have they been totally brainwashed? Who are they? Where did they come from? How did somebody say, “You can be one of the brothers, and you’ve been downtrodden by these French people all of this time, but guess what, now you are going to be somebody.” Who is telling them, and how is that language working to convince this person to do something like that? These are questions that people who use words, and who think about communication, which is you, can be asking. It doesn’t mean that you, of course, have to ask them. We are not sociologists, but I think most people who write are interested in motivations, they are not just interested in plastering a label on somebody and going, “Terrorist.” I don’t know, but the language of defeat, and so on, but I think just starting with trying to understand the motivation, that’s it. I think a lot of people here, also who are being profiled now as well, don’t particularly have a voice. They don’t have the voice that you do, that you are privileged to have, and there are people…because we all say something and people will listen, but a lot of people who are not in that situation. I think it’s not a bad thing, just to always be…It’s a good thing to do self-expression, but it’s another way to think about the world is, “What about people who cannot speak?” What would they be, what’s going on with that situation? I think you can find your way into that if you try. I think it’s worthwhile doing. Todd L. Burns Obviously a lot of your art, Laurie, especially like Homeland, has been inspired by political events. Jean-Michel, I would say, it’s sometimes a little bit harder to discern because of the instrumental nature of your music, often, where the motivation is, and what some of these motivations are. Do you feel like, though, that’s changed over the years? Your motivations for making music? Or is it always been exactly the same thing that’s been driving you? Jean-Michel Jarre Do you know, first of all, I mean, everything is political in a Greek sense of the word, whatever you do, and as a musician you are part of the society, so politics starts by this, a philosophical point of view. I think that music, instrumental music, can be such a political statement, that I discovered recently that my music was not allowed during the Soviet Union in Russia. It was a symbol of, for them, a symbol of evasion or escape, so you never know. Laurie Anderson Escape? Jean-Michel Jarre Escape, yes, escape, evasion and freedom. So be careful, or don’t be careful. You know, it’s not only the words, but I would like to focus a bit also on activities, and also the reason why I’m also happy to be here today, to be seated beside my friend Laurie, because the first time we met, I’ve been always a huge fan of her work, and actually the way she always and is still continuing doing, questioning the world through art and through different kind of art forms. I think it’s what we are all aiming for, I mean, if I may give an advice it’s to do this, I mean, trying to question with whatever you have. With computer, with the violin, with the vocoder or whatever, and it’s something that is quite unique, and because Laurie did it also not only on the musical point of view, but also on a visual point of view, and obviously this is political. It’s not because she is using the word again, but you can use just shapes, drawing, and as we know it’s political or not, but we don’t care if it’s political or not. By the end of the day what is important, I will say, that this is the main difference between international and being universal. Being international is like McDonalds or Coca-Cola, or Google trying to sell something that could be swallowed and digested by anyone in the world, and being universal is actually digging in your own garden to find the common roots we all have. This is something totally different. I think that it’s what we have in this room and beyond. I mean we can be not only understood but felt by anyone on the planet, and maybe beyond. Laurie Anderson Mich, just to ask you a question. Does this situation make you want to do work with other kinds of people, or do something different, or does it give you motivation to think about your own work a different way, or not really? Jean-Michel Jarre You know, I don’t think so, by the end of the day. I think that concerts should remain. I mean, we should not be afraid. Obviously, we know that, for instance, outdoor concerts are a problem these days. I mean, festivals are going to be a problem in the near future for obviously good reasons, but also the answer to what we are…the answer to all this is, “Shouldn’t we go on like we used to do? Changing our minds toward the enemy is one thing, but changing our day-to-day habits as creator, I think we should not. Laurie Anderson I’m just thinking of, does it make you want to expand and like…because you put your work into so many amazingly different cultural contexts, playing in countries that are not on your normal circuit of many artists, so does that make you, for example, want to collaborate with artists that you wouldn’t normally be collaborating with, to extend your musical realm a bit? Jean-Michel Jarre Yeah. I have no preset plan collaborating with Daesh artists, but beyond this, I think that we…as yourself, and probably lots of people in this room, I mean, wanting to experiment. I think that … I don’t know if this answers your question, Laurie, but I think that I’ve always been absolutely against all kinds of boycotts. I think that boycott is something that I don’t understand, deeply. I think that if people suffering about dictator, or somebody hurting the human rights, if on top of this you are saying, “OK, well, we are just turning my back on this side also a bit.” If on top of it, you are actually saying, “OK, these people will not have music, will not have movies, will not have books, on top of it, I think it’s a big mistake.” I think we should all go there, when you have a regime where you think that people are suffering from this regime, you should. It’s what I tried to do in China, or in South Africa, or even here in my own country, when you have the extreme right, I mean, a town or city. I saw some artists saying, “I don’t want to go there.” Do you know, this boycott will end if you start like this, the next week you can also try to stop giving them food, or oil, or whatever. Oil would be, maybe good, because they could use bikes and some other things, but actually, and I think as artists it’s also so apart from all this, also fun to exchange, as you did, Laurie, so many times. I mean, working with different artists, I mean, this is also the best way to not only educate but to soothe the pain also in those kinds of circumstances. I think that these days we should, in a sense, maybe try to create bridges with some part of the world we are probably frightened by, and particularly the Middle East. I remember I did a song, it was in the late ’90s, and I used some samples. I was one of the first ones using samples of Arabic language, and it has been forbidden by some radio stations in France, and that was 20 years ago, 25 years ago, and it’s quite strange. It was actually…it was some samples I used, not religious, I stole that from a radio, from an Arabic radio station, it was just Arabic language like in the news; it was nothing religious or nothing. Laurie Anderson Just for the sound. Jean-Michel Jarre Just for the sound, and also some people were also, a singer was also singing on it, and I just used the Fairlight in those days, doing some samples from a live recording. I think we as artists, we have also not responsibility, we do whatever we want, but I think we should not stop by anything else than, by ideas and what we are going to do. Laurie Anderson I’m interested in you making that kind of distinction between the McDonald’s and the universal. I think that’s a really important one, because I have a feeling that if you try to make music that its goal is to change things or to make things better, it doesn’t work so well. Because it seems to me that you have to think of, like this idea that art and music will make the world a better place. It’s kind of a 19th century idea, that it will make it better, and you have to ask, “Better for who? Better for you and your friends? Or better for who? What are you talking about?” It’s a very tough thing. When you say, make the music that you want to make and you like, is the most important thing to do. Not try to predict what other people are going to like. How do you even know? Often you don’t even know what you yourself like, so how are you going to do that, and convince other people that that’s going to be good for them? That’s very, it’s very patronizing. I think the best is to consider yourself, an average enough person, that what you think is good, someone else will, someone else will find the same thing. But to try to convince someone else, ugh. I mean, I had a grandmother who was a missionary, and I mention this because she used music. She was a Southern Baptist lady, and she went to Japan to convert Buddhists to Southern Baptist religion. She didn’t bother to learn Japanese, no, she just sang songs, she sang hymns, and she hoped the Japanese people would get the idea. They did not, they didn’t know what she was doing. She was a very vain person, she was a Southern lady who was really… she had the skill of making these huge, beautiful, beautiful hats filled with grapes and violets and veils, and so her Japanese audiences are like, “We like that. Nice hats.” She was a wonderful gardener. She had beautiful rose gardens in the South, and she saw them cutting bonsai, and she said, “Teach me to cut bonsai roses.” They taught her to cut bonsai and she taught them to make the hats, and that was it; that was enough. It’s awfully hard to convince somebody to really change their deep feelings and their mind at the bottom, and their dreams and their past, and their culture. You are not going to just sing your way into their heart. You are not, so sing for yourself and hope that other people will go, “I know what he’s talking about, I feel that too.” That’s a way to get inside someone’s head. That’s where you want to go. You want to get right inside someone else’s head, or in their feet or their heart, wherever you want to get, just, you want to get into their body by doing this. You are making worms that go into the ears, earworms that you can’t get out, you can’t get them out, so you want to make those things really, really effective. The way to make those effective, is make them for yourself, so that you go, “Wow. That is great, that’s great. I like it.” First of all, that will be enough of a reason to make it, and if other people like it, great. If a lot of people like it, great, even better, because I do think that it’s important to think about your audience. Who are you doing this for? I mean, you can sit alone in your room and make beautiful music and nobody ever hears it except you, and two people, or one person, and it could be the greatest music in the world. I wouldn’t know that, it could be. I think it’s part of the effectiveness and beauty of music that it jumps quickly to other people and they get it like right away. I bet you know that with your best work that people go, “Wow.” They don’t have to think about it, they don’t have to think about, it they just really instantaneous, it goes into the body, it goes into the mind at the same time. Don’t you think? Jean-Michel Jarre I think that it makes all of us very humble because you can work one month on a piece of music and nothing happens… Laurie Anderson Exactly. Jean-Michel Jarre … and suddenly one hour something quite interesting happens, and you think that you are nothing, for nothing in all of this, and that makes you quite humble. I mean, talking about technology, and because all this, by the end of the day is related to the technology we use, whatever, it’s electronic technology, acoustic or whatever, and we know that technology is dictating styles, and not the reverse, because the pianoforte has been invented by Chopin, and he did what he did. That was the reason why, because the reason that the 78 was existing that probably, Elvis songs were three minutes, and the single became the format in American radio stations. Because of the computer these days that we can have, with hard drives, and a piece of music lasting whatever we want. Also, going back to what you were talking about in terms of people not able to listen to their own music. I thought that, because we are here in this kind of temple, techno temple, I would say that it’s interesting to think that in the 19th century or 18th century or before, people were doing music with the most abstract interface, with a piece of paper and pencil. Lots of people never heard the music. I mean, people as we know, I mean, in the contemporary of Mozart, they wrote some music, they did some music for all their lives, and because they never found a sponsor, a publisher, and being able to pay for printing the score, or for renting the orchestra, they never heard their music. They kept the music in their mind, that’s all. They’ve never been able to share their great symphonies, or a piece of shit maybe, that they had in mind, but at least today we can. We have this luxury that we can do our own craft and we can create our own sounds, and we can also share the result instantly. This is a big, big different approach to music. I learned, my first contact really with electroacoustic music, has been with Pierre Schaeffer and the music research center here in Paris, where so many people were thinking about sounds, where we are thinking about music in terms of sounds and not only in terms of notes or solfége, as we know. He was calling this Musique Concrete, and I always thought it was really good as a name. I was really interested by abstract painting, and was doing lots of paintings, influenced, heavily influenced by Pollock or Soulages, or whatever, and even hesitated at one stage between painting and music, and actually, you’ve been able to keep the two ways, I’ve not. I’ve been maybe too lazy to pursue. Anyway, and we used to call this abstract painting, and I always thought that people like Dubuffet or Pollock or Soulages, people doing peinture concrete, concrete painting, not abstract, because it’s actually… I mean, being directly involved with frequencies and with colors and textures like we are dealing with frequencies, and we are like cooking, cooking frequencies and waves, is what we are doing as musicians. I think we have this luxury these days, this kind of area and what you are organizing, actually allowing lots of people to cook for the future. Todd L. Burns Laurie, you’ve always talked about your work as sculpture with sound, right? Isn’t that the way you talk about the music that you make? Laurie Anderson Some of it, yes, but I started as a painter also, and did sculpture, and I still do a lot of paintings, and sculpture also, but it doesn’t seem to me to be very different. I mean, I know that we do have the art police, and they come in whenever you are doing something out of your category. Those of you who are multimedia artists, I think that’s a really meaningless thing to call yourself, but I call myself that, because it’s easy to, and because the art police show up less when you are doing that, because it’s a little more confusing, because if you say, “I’m a musician,” then they are going, “Well, why are you doing that three-dimensional sound sculpture? If you are a musician, get back in the studio.” Like, “Wait. Didn’t you become an artist so that you could be free? What’s this category stuff” I think it’s not for everybody. I mean, I’m not necessarily thinking that it’s better to be multimedia that single media. I also feel the same way about political art, I don’t think it’s necessarily more virtuous or more interesting to do, art that’s political. Besides, what does it mean anyway? Sometimes if I see a giant, blue painting that teaches me, gives me the feeling of freedom more than a long, tedious essay, or a piece of music about freedom. I was like, “Ooh.” It’s so preachy, because we work with images and sounds. We get to bypass the brain in certain ways, with these things that we work with, so those are dangerous tools, so they can really be so sharp. Anyway, yeah, 3D sound is…I mean sound installation stuff is very interesting to me, but I don’t really see this so different from…For example, if I’m making a big painting, for me it’s very similar to making a piece of music. In fact, the gesture is even similar to playing the violin, this, and I like to make very big paintings, and I look at them, and I have exactly the same question. Is it noisy enough? Is it pushing somewhere enough? Is it beautiful enough? Is it crazy enough? Does it have 17 layers, or only four, or does it only have one? All of those things are the exact same question between a painting and a piece of music for me, and also it’s very similar ways of making them. Todd L. Burns Is that what you think? You were nodding as she was talking about that. Jean-Michel Jarre Yeah. Absolutely; I’m most of the time nodding when Laurie is speaking anyway. Laurie Anderson Nodding off. Jean-Michel Jarre No. You mentioned something I’m really interested by at the moment, this 3D, 3D audio. I would like to share some thoughts with you about this, because that was one of my, if we have had this session tomorrow I would have developed this and sharing some things with you more in detail. I think that, as you were saying, Laurie, I think that, by the end of the day, doing music, or sculpture, or even writing words. We both wrote lyrics for songs, it’s the same, it’s exactly the same thing. It’s actually dealing with emotions and shapes by the end of the day, whatever the shape is. In terms of 3D audio, I think that if you are talking about a bit of the future of music, because it was also previously what we were supposed to do here in these walls… Actually, you know when I started studying electroacoustic music, we were in multi-mono. We were in mono, but multiple mono sources. It was great, and then when I left this for the first time I went into recording studios and it was for me like forgetting my bike, and being in front of a Ferrari, with huge desks, and stereo, and discovering actually the concept of stereo, and very quickly I’ve been quite disappointed and frustrated by stereo all my life. I think one guy in the ’50s invented - or late ’40s, early ’50s, and we had this very fake trick to create space. I mean, just creating a kind of phase, a phase volume between the left and the right, to give you the sense of, the illusion of space. Which is great, because we all like illusions, we are all dealing with illusions, so if it’s considered as an illusion, it’s okay, but it became the Pravda. I’m not really at ease with this, and I think the 21st century is about to go back to what sound, real sound is. When I’m talking to you, I’m in mono. I mean you are animal, we are animal, we are stereo animals, not only stereo animals, but we are 3D audio, on the audio point of view, animals. It means that while I’m talking to you I can see Laurie’s hand with a subtle movement. What she has in her hand? The movement you are putting on your chair just there, and not a lot, because it’s gone quite quiet, but you see what I mean. We are all constantly surrounded by sounds and by informations all around our head, and I think that the fact that suddenly we could start thinking in terms of musical composition as nature is giving us the possibility constantly, to hear and experiment with sounds, I think is going to be the next step. I think we should. As musician, we are the 3D creators, not filmmakers. I mean, we don’t need glasses for 3D, we are able to convey 3D information. Even if we could say that painting could be also 3D because of the wavelength of the colors, and so on and so forth, but you see what I mean. I think that the future is really definitely about exploring the kind of 3D audio, and I would be very interested to have your feedback, maybe later on, on this, because I think that it’s really something I think is going to be developed, and not through this media. The problem is every technology on 3D these days, I mean, quadrophenia, 5.1., they’ve all been failures, because actually now most of the time you have to be in the middle of the room, and nobody is in the middle of the room, neither in your home, and neither in the concert hall. Having said that, it’s a bit too short, Lots of people are working these days on a different approach, not only for listening to music, but for writing and composing music in terms of this kind of audio environment. I think that plug-ins are starting to be developed. I mean, IRCAM has done that, but lots of other companies are working on, and I’m working also close to a company developing this kind of idea. The song we did together recently has actually been, I mixed it and we released it in 3D audio, and that’s something I wanted to share with you, maybe if we had more time, but with headphones, and we just forget this for this time. The next time I really would like to share this with you, because actually it’s quite interesting and an impressive thing, and most of it, and more than the gadget, or gimmick, it’s actually a more natural way to listen to sound and to music, and it’s something that I had lots of pleasure to do with her voice, because you are the natural 3D, because when I was mixing … Laurie Anderson It really was. Jean-Michel Jarre … all those tracks, we’ve done, I mean instantly it goes…instantly in 3D. You have a kind of 3D way of singing, so I’m very jealous. Laurie Anderson Thank you so much. Atmos, did you ever mix for that? Jean-Michel Jarre Sorry? Laurie Anderson The film, Atmos 7.1. Jean-Michel Jarre Yeah, I mean- Laurie Anderson That’s also really interesting. Jean-Michel Jarre Yeah. You need special equipment for this. Laurie Anderson You do, yeah. Actually I mixed my last film in 5.1 and listened to it in Atmos at a film festival just recently, and it was really startling. It was shelves of sound, and you are right, I think the challenge is to figure out music that doesn’t depend on architecture for your point of view, or point of sound where you are, so you are going to be creating different architecture where you are always the center or you are always off to the side. Where is the sweet spot that you are trying to design? Where is the listener, ideally, going to be? I just wanted to say another thing about 3D. When I hear 3D sound, I think more like where music is in the world, because one of the things, and I was just thinking, this is so isolated. I mean, here we are in the music world, but it seems awfully small sometimes. Here is an example that I’m thinking of, and I’m bringing up Brian Eno again, but just because I recently saw him, and he did one of his quiet club projects in Brighton, and a surgeon came to this room, and it was a beautiful piece that was probably seven years long. He sat in there, and he was quite quiet, and the surgeon said, “If only we could have those in hospitals, it would so wonderful.” Because a lot of people really need to focus and listen to something other than electronics beeping; and so in two weeks they had this in a British hospital. Because the walls between music and institutions are thinner there, and I felt, this is fantastic, why don’t more musicians think in those terms of getting out of the so-called music world, and what is music’s function? Where else can it go in cultures? I also spent a lot of time a couple of years ago, in Cleveland, at a really wonderful place called the Cleveland Clinic, which is a big hospital clinic. They have also a big art collection there, and I thought, they are never going to go for this. I said, “Do you know what; how about Brian Eno sound work at the clinic?” They sent someone over there, and now they have one there, but it was very unusual in the U.S. to do that, because usually those places don’t have a sense of music, this is an unusual place that decides that music and art are part of living and being happy, and having health. They decided to include it, but I’d just like to encourage you to think a little bit more in those ways, of not necessarily staying in your corner, because your corner can get a little claustrophobic. Think of where else you can go with it, and what else you can do with music. Jean-Michel Jarre What Laurie is saying, there’s not only FM-40 for your music, but also hospitals, which is quite good. It’s absolutely true. I worked in…when I was with Schaeffer and we had contacts with Stockhausen, in Köln, in Germany, and I participated in that time in some experiment in hospitals by recreating music close to the sound of the womb of the mother, to treat schizophrenia. Laurie Anderson Wow. Jean-Michel Jarre It’s amazing how effective it is. Laurie Anderson Fantastic Jean-Michel Jarre It was a very famous doctor who is the first one who, he used to treat some opera singers such as Caruso and people like this. I remember that we built a kind of glass room, and with some liquid and we were actually reproducing, but with a kind of ambient music, a kind of musical version of the womb, of the mother. I remember this extraordinary moment, where an autistic, autistic-schizophrenic boy, maybe 11 years old. We put his mom in the middle of the room, and she was sitting, and she had never been able to touch her child since he was born. Laurie Anderson OK. Jean-Michel Jarre She was there, and the boy entered in this glass room, and after maybe one minute, he came on the knees of the woman, of his mom, and just like this, and stayed for 50 minutes. It was the first time that they had a physical contact. I just wanted to comment on this, because while you were talking about this, it made me think about the fact that actually, as we know, music can be also approaching so different ways, and it’s very interesting. Also in these areas, we have, the sky is the limit. We have not explored enough of this. Laurie Anderson Yeah. I think it’s really wonderful to go to Mars, definitely an interesting place, and it will be the planet that we’ll have to go to. I spent a lot of time on being Artist in Residence at NASA on this topic of Mars, but more than that, and just listening to you, it would be so interesting to really be able to write music that other species could really appreciate. Imagine writing music for mosquitoes that they would really like, that they would, like, “Get.” I mean, we haven’t really explored so much of our minds, and minds of other species on our planet. I’ll tell you a quick story about a dog concert I did, because I was working on a…I was supposed to give a commencement speech with the Rhode Island School of Design. I was sitting in the green room wearing a mortarboard, the robes, it was really hot, it was so boring. I was like, “Ooh, this…” It’s one of these things that’s just, really late, hours and hours late. I was super guilty because I had to say to these students, “Hey, don’t worry about your student loan, you’ll wipe that out in a minute. Don’t about worry about getting a job in art world or the music world, it’s so easy.” I was like, “What kind of fraud am I? This is so disgusting?” I was feeling super guilty, and I was sitting next to Yo-Yo Ma, the cellist, and he’s also really hot, and really bored, and we are like “Ugh." I said, “Sometimes when I’m doing a concert, I look out and I imagine the whole audience is dogs.” He said, “That’s my fantasy too.” I said, “Really?” I said, “OK. The first person who gets to do that invites the other one.” My concert schedule is a lot simpler than his, so I got an opportunity, actually, I was asked to be the director of a big festival in Sydney. It was a big arts festival, so I got to invite all my favorite painters and directors and writers and sculptors and musicians. Anyway, I said to the promoter, “Also, I want to do a…I’ll be doing a concert with dogs, for dogs.” He didn’t say, “Concert for dogs?” No. He just writes down “Concert for dogs.” I was like, “OK.” We did this concert, and it was where the Sydney Opera House, this big plaza and big steps and sails and everything. We thought a few hundred dogs would show up. Thousands of dogs showed up, thousands. We are like “Cool.” We had our little demarcations in the plaza of small, medium and large immediately overflowed, and the veterinarians were all parked around with their vans, and they are ready for big dog fights. It was a short concert, pretty short, and it started with a…the dog trainer I was working with - because I was planning on doing things up in the registers where dogs hear pretty well - said, “I wouldn’t do that, because you don’t really what’s going to happen.” We took the frequencies down a little bit, but it began for an invocation for whales, because the whales are right there. They are right there in the plaza, and so the beginning was for them, because why do animals sing? To find each other, and the whales to find each other in the ocean, dogs to establish their GPS pattern, “Grr, I’m over here.” “I’m two miles over here, grr.” To map their world. Where are they in relationship to each other? They are somewhat like us in terms of mapping. I just noticed in the beginning of the show there were a lot of Australian dogs who just want to rock. They want to rock. My favorites were the droolers, they were in different rows, and they were just like [mimes drooling], because they didn’t know why they were there, and nobody knew why they were there, really. This is a good situation, when nobody knows why they are there. It’s not a dog run, what am I paying attention to here? Where are the rules? What’s good, what’s bad, what’s not so good, what’s average? Anyway, at the end, they had all been so polite, until I said, “OK, let’s make some noise. OK, little dogs start off, “Arf-arf-arf,” mediums, “Arf-arf-arf,” okay, big ones, “Arff-arff-arff,”” for five minutes. All of these thousands of dogs were just barking just for the hell of it, just because they could, and it was probably the most beautiful sound I ever heard in my whole life. I was like, “This is it.” For me, this was a big thrill to feel this. I mean, once in a while I get to feel that with an audience, but very rarely with an interspecies audience, so that was really interesting. I thought that could be an interesting direction. I’ve been asked many times since then to do more concerts for dogs, but I was so afraid I would be the artist who does the concerts for dogs. Jean-Michel Jarre A label Laurie Anderson A label, yeah, boom. I never did it again, but it’s really an interesting, it was really a lovely, lovely sound, I mean, I really it was so dense and textured and full of joy. It was just pure joy, I thought it was just that. Todd L. Burns I think we should maybe open to questions from the audience. You guys mentioned… Jean-Michel Jarre Yes, a pleasure. Todd L. Burns In the meantime while we are waiting for the microphone to be passed around. You’ve obviously done enormous concerts around the world, but never, no dog concerts. Jean-Michel Jarre No. No. I mean, what Laurie was describing is very similar to an average audience. Some people are going- Laurie Anderson Yeah. Jean-Michel Jarre Some are barking, I meant it’s- Laurie Anderson Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Jean-Michel Jarre You proved…you made your point that there is much less difference than we could think. Laurie Anderson Yeah. Jean-Michel Jarre It’s probably the reason why the dog is our best friend as human being. Laurie Anderson Yeah. The effort they make in having empathy is really impressive, and also I like them very much because they study people, and I like to do that too. “Why are you doing that? Who are you?” They do that, and it’s not just because we are their food supply. I mean, something like that. I don’t want to imagine if they were our food supply, how life would change, but they…I think they also like us because we invented cars. This is, like, impressive. They put their out, and swirl-swirl-swirl. Speed, they just like us. That’s why I like them. Jean-Michel Jarre Which is also interesting beyond the exciting moment of being on stage in front of dogs, is actually this whole idea to imagine what could be music out of our range, our audio range. You are talking about sounds that could be listened by insects, for instance, and all these kinds of things. I’m working at the moment with some people developing some special speakers. They are dealing with ultrasound, and the ultrasound are just converted in our range, by a special algorithm, and the result of it is actually developing very interesting speakers. It’s still in experiment, but I think it’s going to be quite interesting. Because of that, they can have, they can convert…because of this quite complex conversion, I could not explain the scientific point of view or technical point of view. I mean, they can have speakers very directional, so the idea of it is actually like…because we are dealing with an ultrasound process. You can have speakers, for instance, around this laptop, and I would listen to the sound, but you being seated here would not hear anything, so it’s quite interesting, and I think that it’s quite interesting to explore also sounds in different ways. Like, I worked a few years ago with astrophysician. He spent lots of time to record the sounds of the planet. He gave that to me, and we are still working on this project, to make music with the sound of the planet, and what is the sound of the planet, is actually to convert the vibrations of and the energy of every planet into a sound that we can hear, which is very interesting. As a first comment, the sound of the sun is very male, and the sound of moon is very female. It’s a very soft sine wave for the moon, and a strong square wave for the sun. It’s quite interesting. Then these guys exploring and transmitting beyond the solar system, and this is just what made me thinking about what you were saying earlier about the idea of it, it’s interesting also to approach the exploration of music and sound, with the concept that we are not able to…which is out of our range, and to try to convert it, is what we are saying. The whales, it’s in our range, but it’s so magical because it’s coming from something totally outside from our own species, and it’s very interesting, yeah. Laurie Anderson For those of you who want to geek out on that, check out Walter Murch and his beautiful series. He’s one of the great film editors, but also one of the great sound theoreticians, and he is a really, really interesting writer, and you’ll get a lot of ideas from reading his books and checking out his theories on music and aleatoric music and math and the universe. Todd L. Burns Are there any questions from the audience? I should have noted also that Laurie will be speaking a little bit afterwards, Jean-Michel has to go at a certain point, so obviously feel free to ask both of them questions, but if you definitely have a question for Jean-Michel. Jean-Michel Jarre Or comments, not only questions. Todd L. Burns Or comments, of course. Jean-Michel Jarre Because we are only here for just discussions, and not questions. Discussing about what, or we can ask questions maybe, ask some questions. Todd L. Burns If you can just wait for the microphone. Audience Member Check? Yes. It’s working. Hi. Thank you both for the talk, it was really moving, listening to your stories. This is not a question, but more of a thought. Even I feel like music is a very direct experience compared to other art forms, at least for me. It’s like, if you look at literature or something, there’s a lot of logic involved in the brain in converting the words to meaning, and then that meaning affecting you. Then music is just like… it’s just something that directly controls…you can feel it just when it happens itself, and it bypasses that whole logical aspect of it, and I think that’s kind of why I feel music is so powerful in the way it moves people. Yes. I just wanted to really…Yeah. Jean-Michel Jarre Yes. You are right. I think that, I don’t know if music is specific. I thought about that when I was younger, that music was really different from any other thing, and I think it’s more like the same as breathing, as writing, as painting, it’s part of the same process going from this kind of strange, unknown travel from getting ideas and from the outside, and processing them inside, and then vomitting them, in a sense, so where you are getting through with kind of…as we in French, from the outside to the inside, and just filtering them and then whatever it is, into poems, or writings and paintings or sounds. I think that it’s the reason why I like what Laurie was saying about multimedia artists, even if I agree with her as well, to the fact that it doesn’t mean necessarily mean anything, but we have no… and this place is a multimedia place, and I think it should be explored more. Sometimes I still think that we are too much in our own ghettos. I mean, people of the visual, people of writing, and I think Red Bull Academy should think about this. I mean, maybe mixing also not only people who are musicians, but also people dealing with visual arts and words, because I think all this, by the end of the day, it’s more of the same. We have lots to learn from each other, I think. Laurie Anderson I would say that, what you said about it being a little bit more direct. I would agree with that, because in the sense that it’s more physical, so that you can…it can make you dance, music can make your heart beat really fast, it can make you cry. I would say that, just a guess, but I would say that more people would cry at hearing their favorite song than if you walk into a museum and people are standing in front of their favorite painting crying. I think things come through our eyes in a very different way. Not that it’s less meaningful, but it’s less immediately, physically provocative. Music, there is some music you hear and you just cannot not move. You must move. That’s a really powerful thing, it’s almost a puppeteering kind of thing. That’s really crazy power. I don’t see other art forms having that kind of power. I’ve noticed in, like, making films and things, that you can play against these different things. For example, words that come through your ears, and words that you only read. So imagine the kind of way that you analyze words that are only coming in through your eyes, and other ones that are said to you, and spoken and voiced. There is a section in the film that I just did, which is only that you read very, very, very fast, and I invented this software for the Kronos Quartet, they had invited me to make a quartet. They said, “We want to tell stories.” I said, “Why would you tell stories, you have such great chops, why don’t you just play.” Besides, sometimes when musicians get up and do other things, like play percussion, or do theater stuff, it’s sort of, it’s better if they sit down and play, honestly. Anyway I said, “I’ll write something so that you can tell stories with your instruments.” They said, “Great.” Then I said, “I don’t know how to do that.” I worked with software guy and we came up with this language program, so that as you play it triggers projected words, but in a way that’s super fast, super precise, so if someone is improvising, that’s the number of words you just read. You are going like, “Huh. I can read ten times faster than I thought,” which is kind of a thrill, but also you realize these are coming in a very different way. So sometimes, and I used those sometimes in a slower form, really to address the person in you that never speaks. The one who is like the silent, the witness person, who is back there mostly using the more visual thing, just watching, watching you do things, so often getting kind of frustrating; like right now, for example, my inner person is wishing I wasn’t talking. Exactly, like, “Please.” Have you ever had this experience, like you are in the middle of some kind of conversation, and there’s just something, somebody rattling on going like this, blah-blah-blah, with some theory. You realize, that’s me, but you can’t stop. Your inner person is going, “You really have to stop talking, just stop now, because it’s better if you just stop, you are sounding idiotic, it’s babbling.” Language is addictive, and anyway…just an example of what I’m saying. Todd L. Burns Are there any other questions? Audience Member I’m not sure if this is a question or a comment, but earlier you were talking about how to understand the people who have been identified as enemies and empathy. I think a great way to do that is through sound, because, for example, 9/11, it’s a sound-based experience, hearing people in chaos, hearing people screaming hurt word, etc, etc… I think that…not just musicians necessarily, but people in general could understand the people who have been identified as other, if they related sound to their general experience, like what it’s like to hear a drone, like, routinely. The use of police sirens, and Ferguson, etc., etc…, and the way that sound maps your body. I think that has yet to be explored in the way that it should. With the exception of like, Matthew Herbert, in that one album he did, where he sampled four minutes of a drone and made a 40-minute recording of it, following his One Pig album, so I think there’s a lot to be done there, yeah. Jean-Michel Jarre It’s a very interesting comment. I think actually it’s a good way of understanding each other beyond words. We have this advantage as musicians, not necessarily using words. It’s strange in our world that actually, historically, music was music, and songs as an art form was a part of a generic genre of music, and since the ’50s and ’60s, it should be almost the reverse. For example, formerly lots of people are always asking me, “Why you are not putting words in your music?” I’m saying “The music, I don’t necessarily need words on it.” I think that the power of sound, as you said, can convey emotions in non-narrative way, which, I’m very interested by. The fact that music is creating, is probably the most interactive art form, because it’s allowed to create the soundtrack, the soundtrack of your own film, or of all your own movie, your own story, and you can create your own story from this. Even if actually in a strange way where we could use words, and Laurie, in her work, in some previous work we’ve done together. I mean like, by using just phonemes or words that are not necessarily…yeah, sounds, and through sounds you can actually trigger the idea of creating, other people could create their own story from that, and I think a good way to understand other people, it’s also through…I mean, forgetting words, and the meaning of words, but going through and using sounds. I totally agree with this. Todd L. Burns Anyone else? Jean-Michel Jarre Yes. Audience Member Just following what you were just saying about using sounds to connect with people, I think when things like what happened the other night happen these days often you’re finding out over Twitter and social media, and you feel like there’s a disconnect, because there are no sounds, it’s just words, and that’s basically the main way that news travels these days. How do you think that changes things? Laurie Anderson That’s a really good point, because it’s news with already an opinion, it’s already mediated by one thing, so you are getting farther and farther away from the experience. Yeah, it might be really interesting to do news that was just pure sound of what it really was like there. And mic it in a different way, too. Probably the worst sound is a human voice crying. That gets everybody, every time. Or, human sounds, like you are saying. Jean-Michel Jarre For those of you, for instance you have some plug-ins, I mean, actually IRCAM is doing, we were talking about this, just previously. Like, for instance, you take the speech, and you get rid of one of the three parameters in the sound of speech, which is the formant, and the noise, and the frequency, the sine wave. By just cancelling one of these three parameters, the speech is not understandable anymore, but you keep the music, and it’s quite interesting because we all have our own music, and I think that it’s not neutral, all right, so it’s not neutral. In a way, we know for instance, you have in, I don’t know, in an amphitheater, on the whole you can have people, giving lectures, and it’s very interesting what they say, but nobody cares. You have other people doing silly things, and having no particularly interesting thought, but they will capture the audience, just because of the music, of their music, and it’s quite interesting. It could be quite interesting to think about CNN without words, but just sounds, to see where that goes. Laurie Anderson I think one of the reasons that words and pictures dominate the news is because you can say, “Terrorist attack, and six pictures,” and it takes three seconds, and sound unravels in time, and so it can’t do that. You’ll have to find another way to convey something. We are in a culture that is very short. The story has to be three seconds. Jean-Michel Jarre That will just… Laurie Anderson Maybe there’s a way to do that with sound, I’m not sure how, but… Jean-Michel Jarre Yes, yes and no, because it’s very interesting to see that this generation and your generation is about to zap three seconds on YouTube, but you can also sit for a whole weekend to watch the entire series of Game of Thrones, or True Detective for 24 hours without sleeping and without stopping, it’s something quite new, which was not existing even ten years ago. Laurie Anderson You need sound for those. Jean-Michel Jarre You need sound for those. Laurie Anderson It would be pointless without it. Jean-Michel Jarre That’s right. Laurie Anderson Those would really be any Todd L. Burns To some news channels’ credit, I actually on Friday night was watching the news, and there was this section that was called “No Comment,” and it was just literally watching some sort of- Jean-Michel Jarre I love this; this is Euronews… Todd L. Burns ...hospital or something. Jean-Michel Jarre Euronews has a very interesting…some of you probably don’t know this channel, it’s a European channel, and they have this fantastic item called, actually, “No Comment,” and it’s no words, just pictures and in silence, in silence, total silence, no music, just total silence. Actually, I know the people from Euronews and they recorded ten different types of silences, because they are broadcasting in Romania, in Germany, France and lots of countries. They were European countries most of time, and they recorded, one guy, considered quite crazy, but quite interesting for the discussion we have. Actually he went to record ten different silences in the country, they are broadcasting to this “No Comment” thing, and it’s quite interesting. It makes me think about Stanley Kubrick, maybe you know that. For 2001 he recorded lots of different silences, he sent lots of sound engineers to record different type of silence; the silence of the desert, the silence of country, which is not silence. Total silence is difficult to get. Todd L. Burns Anyone else? Yes? Vivian Host Thank you guys for being here. That was a very inspiring chat. I was wondering of either of you had seen any art that was a response to a tragedy, or a political event, or a world event, that you felt was particularly moving or effective, or just ingenious, or creating a new conversation about something. Anything from a tsunami to 9/11 to… Jean-Michel Jarre I can answer that. There is one thing in my mind just now, it’s actually when Solidarność happened in Poland, they had this hymn, anthem, that suddenly came out called “Mury” that was made by the…it was an old song, but suddenly all the workers, the dockers in this place I mean, just used this music, and they started, and it became a strong anthem, but not as an anthem for something, just an anthem for them, for the place, for the location, and it was…I played there some years ago, and we played that track, that song. It was amazing to listen to this piece of music in the place it has been born for political reasons. Because for people who don’t know, the docks of Gdansk, is where Lech Wałęsa with few dockers and few workers, it’s just a bunch of people, they actually changed the world by killing the Soviet Union system. It was as simple and as big as that. Just the song, I mean, just had been created at that moment, and this is something I’m sure that lots of examples are existing, but it’s very interesting what you are saying about this relationship of the instant of the catastrophe or something, and suddenly you have some music or art form emerging. You have that also enduring with your street art obviously, with what you could see in the Berlin Wall, for instance, not only around the world, but the first street art and graffiti, it’s just when the Berlin Wall, the wall has been built, are quite amazing compared to the one that had been done afterwards. Those ones in the instant have that kind of very strange role, power, and I think that it’s a very interesting point to explore that. It would be interesting to know more about this kind of music, because I’m sure that lots of, I don’t know if you have personal experience, knowledge about that, it’s very interesting point about what happened during… I think that in concentration camp, I mean people also, I was then just briefly talking about my mom being in the French Resistance, and she was, she had been in the concentration camp, and she’s told me that people were actually creating songs in one night, because they knew that they were going to be probably dead the following day. Suddenly you have musicians and they are composing some, improvising some chants, and obviously that is also another example. Laurie Anderson One of my favorite pieces of music of all time is “Quartet for the End of Time,” Messiaen, who composed it in a concentration camp also. Incredibly joyful, beautiful piece of music, but one which was, had what you are saying, a sense of time, that it’s about time that was almost over. It’s the subject of the piece as well, but it’s funny because all of the musical lines take their time, and they are just, they feel like they have all the time in the world to unrole their phrases, and they are so lyrical and lovely. It is not like, “Oh, well, we have only three seconds.” It just does the opposite, it kind of blooms, it’s a magnificent piece of work if you haven’t heard it, check it out, “Quartet for the End of Time” by Messiaen, it’s really, really…it has this special relationship to time, it really does. Jean-Michel Jarre It’s interesting about what we are discussing altogether, I mean, that fact that actually, in a sense I think that you have to be happy to create sad songs, because when you are really sad, and we are confronting tragedy, I think the survival instinct makes you probably compose something optimistic, and joyful, exactly what were saying with Messiaen, it’s exactly that. Laurie Anderson Yeah. The movie that I just finished called Heart of a Dog is… the center of it is a thing that one of my teachers said, which is, you should try to practice how to feel sad without actually being sad. Jean-Michel Jarre Exactly. Laurie Anderson Which is not that easy to do; of course the idea is that there are so many sad things in the world, and if you push them away, if you pretend they are not there, We are just like, “They are going to come and they are going to find you, and they are bite you, and they can hit you over the ahead, they will.” They are there. The idea, though, is get it, and then do not become it. You see a person linger, a person who has basically says, “We are here to have a very, very, very, very good time. That’s what we are here for. That’s what we are here, that’s our job here,” so don’t get distracted. Or think of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who has advice for writers, who would say, “Listen, just try to imagine that you are holding two opposite ideas, one in each hand, they are absolutely opposing ideas, and they are also each totally true. Try to hold those things without going crazy, and that’s how to write.” I think that’s good advice, because often we are sort of encouraged to choose, “This is the better one.” I said, of course, as we know, it’s very circumstantial, it’s very point of view, what you think is good, there are certain things that are better for you at the moment. Anyways, some of those exercises in duality I think are really good to keep in mind. Todd L. Burns I think that’s a wonderful note to stop here on. Please help me thanking both of you for being here today. We really appreciate it. Jean-Michel Jarre Thank you. Laurie Anderson Thank you.

Title: Kardinal Offishall

Kardinal Offishall
For decades, Toronto hip-hop fans have understood their own sound: a hybrid of East Coast boom bap and West Coast melodies with an aesthetic style and cadence derived from the Caribbean. Rapper and producer Kardinal Offishall wasn’t the first from the city to come up with this, but he did perfect it. In doing so, he established Canada’s inaugural contribution to hip-hop’s canon of regional sounds. Kardi’s ingenuity won him awards and the respect of his American peers and it gave aspiring musicians leverage to leap over the structural limitations of the local industry, and express themselves as defiantly Canadian — no matter where their families originate.
In his 2016 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Kardinal discusses Montréal’s hip-hop scene, the impact Canadian artists have had on American music, his career, and more.
Hosted by Anupa Mistry OK, so I have someone here with me who... well if you’re talking about Canadian music and you don’t know his name, then you don’t know Canadian music. And I want to stress music in particular, not just hip-hop. Because what this person does is commendable and is a landmark achievement for a musician from this country regardless of genre. Please join me in welcoming Kardinal Offishall. Kardinal Offishall Thank you for that by the way. Anupa Mistry You’re welcome. So we're here in beautiful Montréal. But you’re from Toronto, I’m from Toronto and it seems like Toronto plays a prominent part in the pop music narrative right now. You’ve been lucky in your two-decade long career to kind of see all different parts of this country. I mean what comes to mind for you when you think of hip-hop and Montréal? Kardinal Offishall It’s interesting because I think what’s ironic for me about understanding the Montréal hip-hop scene more was going to France, because it’s like when you grow up, everybody, we all know about the preconceived biases that we have. Like anybody that’s from Toronto and knows about Toronto, there’s always a very friendly Toronto versus Montréal type of culture. Even though we both have love and respect for each other's city, but I think it was when I really started going to France were I was like, “Ah, this is just like Montréal.” And then I would go back for another show and we’d go all over France, and then when I came back... sometimes that’s what happens is it’s like, you go away and you kind of fall in love more with the things that are close to you and have always been very close to you, but what I love about the hip-hop scene here is the fact that it’s always been very self-sufficient and it didn’t really rely on what was going on in the rest of the country, much less Toronto. Not just with hip-hop but just music in general. There’s so many artists that can sell like 100,000; 150,000; 200,000 units in just Quebec alone and we maybe in Toronto have no clue or idea of who that artist was, and to me that’s always something that I always admired. It’s that same type of passion that I identify in several places that I’ve been to around the world. That’s why I’ve always been, since the first day that I went back in 1999, I’ve always been a fan of the UK music scene, because also they have a scene that kind of fuels itself. It’s not like so... I think affected by what goes on in the States like how Toronto is – and I’m sure we’ll probably get to that a little bit later – but we’ve always had this big brother, but treat him like a step brother, second cousin type of relationship with America, so yeah. That’s always been our dilemma, but I like the scene here because it’s like whenever you come here and you’re introduced to the new sounds and the new people it’s dope because they’re already rocking, and they don’t really care if you know who they are or not. Like the Montréal scene and the Quebec scene supports itself. Obviously there’s people like Kaytranada and those people that have kind of transcended everything but it’s like, yeah there’s a lot of amazing people here within music and just the arts in general. Anupa Mistry And part of the reason for that is the cultural makeup here is different than it is in a primarily English speaking city like Toronto. A big part of the Toronto music, or certainly the Toronto hip-hop narrative has to deal with the West Indian community in Toronto, which is made up of primarily Jamaican people, people from Guyana, Trinidad, Barbados. Here, there are a lot of immigrants from French speaking countries, so Haitians, people from parts of West Africa. How have you seen that play out in the music scene here? Kardinal Offishall It’s still playing out if you ask me. It’s still in the growing process, because I think no matter what scene it is, it’s always going to bubble up and get to a point of having to explode and having to seep into the ecosystems in other places. I think with people like Kaytranada and others and, obviously, I was here a couple of months ago with the Fool’s Gold Festival, and people like A-Trak, you’re always going to have a handful of people that get through and then help to deliver the message and spread the message of what’s going on back home. I think what’s going on now, and especially with Kaytranada winning the Polaris the other day, it’s going to bring a lot more shine and spotlight to Montréal. Anupa Mistry Your family is from Jamaica. You were born here, if I’m correct. Kardinal Offishall Mm-hmm. Anupa Mistry Can you talk a little bit about what your family experienced immigrating to Toronto? Kardinal Offishall Well, for those that aren’t familiar and there’s a lot of people, ironically, everybody talks about how Toronto is the spotlight and people talk about Toronto, but they don’t really talk about the legacy and the story of Toronto and how it got to where it is right now. In terms of the Caribbean community, a lot of it was a great brain drain that happened in the West Indies. They actually went to those different islands looking for professionals, looking for teachers, looking for doctors, engineers, nurses, the whole nine yards. That’s how a lot of my family ended up leaving Jamaica to come here, so we had same thing. We had nurses, we had teachers, professors that came to Canada, but also for my family, went to London, went to Chicago, Florida. Of course, instead of picking the warm lovely place of Florida, my family said, “Let’s go to cold-ass Toronto,” but yeah, my parents actually met here. Even though they’re both from Jamaica, they actually met here. My mom I think when she was either in teacher’s college or something of the sort, she used to work with my aunt, so she actually met my aunt on the job. I think they used to work at The Bay or something and... Anupa Mistry That’s a department store? Kardinal Offishall Right. My dad, obviously, being my aunt’s brother, used to hang around and say, “Who’s that?” Eventually, that’s what us guys do. We hunt and trap and make babies in life, so that’s how my family got together. My family, we came up in the ’70s and that’s when a large, large, large portion of people came from the Caribbean, not just Jamaica. It was during Pierre Trudeau, when he was in power, because he was the one that... Anupa Mistry Former prime minister. Kardinal Offishall Former prime minister, yeah, the father of the guy that’s there now. He was the one that actually had interesting policies when it came to immigration and opened the doors to a lot of people to immigrate to the country, so it’s actually a very similar story that a lot of immigrants share that came to Canada back in those times. Anupa Mistry We’ll obviously get into this a little bit more, but I want to lay the groundwork for talking about your music. I just want you to briefly fill everyone in in on why the West Indian community in Toronto is so crucial to our cultural identity as a city? Kardinal Offishall I like the way that you put that. I think, to be completely honest, any musician, any artist, anybody that participates within the arts, the ones that have flourished have been the ones that have been true to themselves and true to what their story is, no matter how glamorous it was, or how much of a reflection of the atrocities that it is. I think that’s like when you think about the story of hip-hop, it’s kind of ironic, but at the same time, it’s not an irony that they attribute the beginning of it to Kool Herc, who was a Jamaican, and brought the whole sound system culture to the Bronx, you know what I’m saying? Like there’s a certain vibrancy and a certain similarity that exists between I think what was happening in the Bronx, you know what I’m saying, during the time that hip-hop, or at least the name hip-hop was given birth to, there was a similarity between what was happening there and I guess some of the stuff that was happening with the ghetto youths in Jamaica. I think when it comes to Toronto, with there being... it’s funny. I think it was his nephew. I went to school with Kool Herc’s nephew, you know what I’m saying, and that was just random. He’s like, “Yeah, you know, that’s my uncle.” I was, like, “Well, he’s Jamaican, so it makes sense.” It happens. Anybody who is Jamaican you know that you’re probably related to somebody important down the line. I think in terms of the genetic makeup of Toronto, for us to be true to who we were, some of our earlier greats were people like Michie Mee, people like the Dream Warriors, people like Maestro Fresh Wes. This was way before my time, but if you look at it, Maestro’s family is Guyanese, the Dream Warriors are from, where are they from? I think like St. Kitts or something. Don’t mind me. Jamaicans, we’re very egotistical. We only care about the big islands. We don’t really pay much attention to the smaller islands but, yeah, pretty much anybody who is doing anything in the scene in the early days of Toronto, all had Caribbean roots, so for us to really and truly be who we were and be true to ourselves, we had to reflect what our lineage was and what our culture was. Because especially at the time I guess when the scene was forming within Toronto, it’s like we, for the most part, did not want to just copy and emulate what was going on in the States. We wanted for the world to know who we were and, obviously, within our story it went in waves. But, initially, I remember being a little kid and I used to live in a place called Flemingdon Park and I remember when Michie Mee back in, like, 1987 or something, came to the hood. She was shooting a video in Flemo and she brought this red drop-top Porsche or something, you know what I’m saying? So as a kid I remember my first I guess local superstars and local heroes to me, those were the types of things that they emulated. It’s like if you think about somebody that’s from your city, somebody like Michie Mee who embraced her culture and her lineage from day one and, then, you think about just in the grand scheme of things, you look at hip-hop, the bigger picture, and you have like KRS-One who, a year before, comes out with “The Bridge Is Over,” you know what I’m saying? And for a lot of people, if you do your history, if you’re not familiar, “The Bridge Is Over” is arguably one of hip-hop’s most important songs and especially, definitely one of the most important battle songs, you know what I’m saying, because it’s like within the past couple of years, this whole battle/beef thing has been picking up, and you see amazing songs like “Back to Back” that are becoming these anthemic songs, you know what I’m saying? Like it’s more than just the battle or the beef, but this has been happening for decades and decades within hip-hop. “The Bridge Is Over,” the majority of the people I think that love the song were not thinking about how KRS-One was totally just demolishing MC Shan at the time. They were just like, “The song is just super dope and super ill.” It’s like if you’re looking at one of the greatest hip-hop songs that ever came out, you’re looking at Michie Mee and all these other variables. That just gave birth to people like me who is like, “Oh, this is what we’re supposed to do,” you know what I’m saying? We’re supposed to embrace it and big up who we are. I think from those times, even as a little kid, those were the things that planted the seeds to grow into what it became. Anupa Mistry That means it’s only natural that your first single, which is a song called “Naughty Dread,” would sound like this. (music: Kardinal Offishall – “Naughty Dread” / applause) Kardinal Offishall Yo, the wild thing about that song is... Anupa Mistry That came out in 1996. Kardinal Offishall It did. Oh, it’s the 20 year anniversary. Anupa Mistry It sounds like it came out yesterday. Kardinal Offishall It’s my anniversary. The wild thing about that song is that that song and, this is ironic, actually got me my first publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music. Anupa Mistry You were how old? Kardinal Offishall I don’t know. At the time, let me see, 20. 20, or just turning 20, or one of the two. The person that heard that, Anne-Marie Smith from Warner/Chappell, she’s like, “I don’t know what this is, but this is fucking crazy, and I need to sign him, and blah blah blah.” What she didn’t know at the time was that I sampled Bob Marley, and there was no way she was going to get any publishing from that. It’s probably not the smartest thing to do, but she’s a genius for doing it. It’s crazy, and I had to... not [that] I had to, but because we couldn’t afford to pay producers at the time, I produced that song myself, too. Yeah, getting that publishing deal and at the time, I will say, because this will come up later on, at the time, the money that I thought I was getting, I was like, “Holy shit.” At the time, I was dead-ass broke. They offered me this publishing deal for all this money, and I was like, “Oh, shit. It’s about to be on now.” I paid for my university bills. OSAP, I don’t know if they have that in... Anupa Mistry Student loans. Kardinal Offishall Student loans, paid my OSAP, gave my mom some money, and probably had a few thousand dollars left to buy an ASR, an ASR-10. Yes, I’m dating myself. It’s an Ensoniq machine. All you producers know about it because it’s the greatest machine ever built. Yeah, that song, that was really the jump-off for a lot of stuff, because it was through that publishing deal that I was able to also go to the studio and create my first independent album called InI. Anupa Mistry Can you talk a little bit about the sample that’s on that track? Kardinal Offishall I don’t know if I should. No, it’s too late now. Plus, I know Stephen Marley, so it’s cool. You know what, it was one of those things for us. For me, that was was my perfect first song, because I think, just listening to it, I’m laughing at how I program stuff and how I EQed it and whatever. I think what was awesome was that it’s like for us. And when that song came out, and that’s called the Eglinton West mix of the song, there’s actually a version that’s like, I don’t even remember what area I named the original, but that’s called the Eglinton West mix of the song because it’s like, if anyone knows anything about Toronto, Eglinton West, that’s like Little Jamaica. That’s where you’ll go and have all the Caribbean stores and the food and the people and the whole nine yards. It’s like when that came out, it was... People just had a lot of admiration for wanting it being called Eglinton West Mix, but just the vibe of it. You know what I’m saying? It was one of the first times in a long time that there was something that was just totally us, in terms of just a song like that, a sample, that Bob Marley, that, “Dread natty, dread now.” That’s a song we would listen to on a Saturday morning when you’re being forced to clean your parent’s home or if you’re at your aunt and uncle’s house and forced to clean their home. These are the songs... I think it’s like a psychological game that they play. They’d play these nice, amazing reggae songs so it wouldn’t feel like slave labor. That’s what, that’s kind of the vibe that we grow up on. You know what I’m saying? It’s like that's the music, those are the vibes and things that we grew up on. To be able to sample that and put that into a song that represented who we were as young people in our teens and stuff. I think that was... It was really dope and a telltale sign of what would end up starting my whole career. They say for the most part, put your best foot forward and how you start is usually how you’ll end. Anupa Mistry I mean, I wanted to play that song not only because it’s your first single. You also won a Juno Award for that, right? Kardinal Offishall I don’t remember. Anupa Mistry Yeah, you do. Kardinal Offishall No disrespect, Junos. Thank you. (laughs) That’s awesome. Anupa Mistry I wanted to play that song because everything you’re doing on it, the melody flow, the rhythm, that stuff that is still present in your music today, and you’ve shown a really, really strong command of that stuff. I mean, where did that come from? Kardinal Offishall I mean, one thing to note about me is that I came up around a lot of DJs. I grew up with music, you know what I’m saying. My dad was a DJ. He passed, but his record collection, you would see all of them say DJ Soul Prince. My dad was an avid record collector. If you know anything about how the vibes were in Toronto, they were... they were extremely tough. If you were able to be successful in Toronto, you could be successful anywhere, and I say that not exaggerating. The time that we came up, literally, I was telling one of my young Gs today, “You would get bottled off stage if you were whack.” It’s not like he could go on stage, not be good, and people would just be like, “He was okay.” You would literally get food, bottles, all kinds of stuff thrown at you. It was not a very receptive environment. It was like you had to be dope. You had to have a certain type of aggression, and I think that was within our music, but it was just also with it, it was within the shows, and also in the streets. At those times, obviously, the Internet wasn’t around... it wasn’t... things didn’t exist like how they exist now. It’s like the interaction that we had, I remember there was a time, it was interesting for me and I’m sure it was for him, but there was a time where me and Drake sat down many years ago, before the record deals and all that, and he was explaining to me, you know, how much people cared about what people said online. He’s like, “My generation, that means a lot. If there’s hate online and people are saying negative things about you,” and I was like, “That’s fascinating,” because I was like, “To me, having a gun pointed in my ribs was the way that we knew that people didn’t fuck with us.” It’s not to belittle or try and pretend that those aren’t very valid feelings to what’s going on now, but it’s like, me personally, I would just prefer somebody type something and press enter and me type something and said, “Fuck off,” and close my computer. Way safer. Way safer. (laughs) Anupa Mistry Do you do that now? Kardinal Offishall Huh? Anupa Mistry Do you do that now? Kardinal Offishall No, no. I don’t engage. I don’t engage. Anupa Mistry The other thing about that track is that it ended up on a compilation album put out by Beat Factory. Kardinal Offishall Rap Essentials. Anupa Mistry Yes. Kardinal Offishall Yeah. Anupa Mistry Beat Factory was an independent Toronto label. Do you remember what else was on that compilation? Kardinal Offishall Shit. Anupa Mistry It’s not a test. Kardinal Offishall It feels like one. No, and all my friends are going to be like, “You’re an asshole. You didn’t even see my name on there.” Anupa Mistry It’s all your friends who are on it. Kardinal Offishall That’s good to note that it was a very close-knit community in Toronto. Before we knew that “do it yourself” was a thing, that’s just what we did. There was a very, very, very vibrant independent scene at the time with people that were taking their own money and they were creating these record labels. Pretty much everybody out on the scene in Toronto at the time had their own label or they were affiliated to a certain label. Anupa Mistry Like Capitol Hill. Kardinal Offishall For us, for our crew, it was Capitol Hill. Also, Knee Deep Records. Then, you had Groove-A-Lot Records. You had... I can’t remember, Frankenstein had a label. There were all these different labels that all these artists were associated with, and I think it was that kind of “do it yourself,” but also that close-knit community that gave birth to the atmosphere. I really feel like what’s going on in a city and the vibrancy and kind of how you view yourself... For instance, like right now in the UK with grime. Grime’s been around forever and a day but now that it’s starting to get international acclaim – when you go to London or when you talk to your people in London – it’s just creating monsters, because people are all of a sudden super hungry, they’re super hype because the spotlight is on and at any single second anyone can pop. But then also because they’re representing a whole genre and a whole country and a whole movement. I think that’s how it was for us back then, it’s like you had all these ill MCs like Ghetto Concept, ORB, which stood for Original Rude Boy, that gave birth to Jelly Stone. Those guys that came from Rexdale, you had all these guys from the east, G Knight, Sixth Sense, Citizen Kane. Then you had the Choclair, the Saukrates and all these different people. What was going on in the city, if all that shit wasn’t happening at the time I don’t think that the music would have been as urgent. You know what I’m saying? I think also what happened to inject something that is very, very key, in 1992 was the Rodney King beating. We all know about the LA riots and the ripple effect that it had. Well that ripple came all the way to Toronto and there was actually riots that occurred up and down Yonge Street and because of those riots that happened in Yonge Street, the government invented something or created something rather, that was called the JOY program and that stood for Jobs for Ontario’s Youth. And it was through the JOY program working together with the Toronto Arts Council that they created something that was first called Fresh Elements and the second phase of it was called Fresh Arts and it was through the Fresh Arts program that I was mentored. What happened was with that program they had people from the TV industry, from the radio industry, studios, all these people, they donated their time and their experience to mentor us and it was from that, that came people like who you guys know now as Director X. People like Saukrates, who out of my crew was the first to get a record deal in 1995 with Warner Brothers. Came Choclair, came Jully Black. All these people... sorry that I didn’t mention her earlier because I actually forgot that she’s from Montréal, but Tara Chase who was the female rapper in our crew. She was originally from Montréal and we stole her and brought her to Toronto. But out of that craziness within society, again it trickled down and somehow managed to merge its way into the music. Again, it’s all these different things that just happened in succession that played an amazing part and I think the big boom that happened in Toronto in the early to mid ’90s. Anupa Mistry At the same time that this was happening in Toronto, in Vancouver there was a label called Figure IV, started by Sol Guy and he was managing a group called the Rascalz and you guys did a song together and in 1998, you also put out a video for the track. I think Terra Chase makes a cameo in this, am I correct? Kardinal Offishall I think so. I haven’t watched it for a while, I’m ashamed of my hair. Anupa Mistry No, it’s great. Kardinal Offishall It looks mad crazy in that video, I’m just saying. Anupa Mistry Yeah, we’re going to take a look at that. (video: The Rascalz – “The Northern Touch” / applause) Some fans of that track in here. What did we watch, what did we just watch? Kardinal Offishall We watched me with a hairdo that only a young black female should have. Anupa Mistry It’s a video for a song by the Rascalz called “The Northern Touch.” Kardinal Offishall Yeah. Anupa Mistry Featuring yourself, Saukrates. Kardinal Offishall I can only do it if I actually rap the chorus otherwise I always forget. It was Rascalz, Checkmate, Kardinal and Thrust, Choclair. Yes, there you go. Those are all of us. I mean that was a wild time and it’s like, I’ll be honest a lot of times it’s hard to just sit still. Because, the interesting thing about there being the first time for something is: there’s only the first time one time and that was the first time that the whole country was united in one song. Being a part of that whole movement was life changing, because it’s like, pretty much before then, even if you had love for something from your city or from the country. You’re like, “It’s kind of cool,” but you wouldn’t really say that in public. That was the first time that the entire country, every single concert was sold out and it was sold out in the way that the kids were... The way those shows were, I had never seen that before, ever, ever, ever, ever. It was crazy because it’s the first time that I think, especially within hip-hop that there was a national pride. But also it’s like, it was kind of a wake up call for us as artists. You know what I’m saying? It was dope for the country because they’re like, “Fuck, we are dope.” You know what I’m saying? It’s funny when I see this whole 'We The North' campaign with the Raptors and stuff like that. All that really is, is a regurgitation of the atmosphere that gave birth to stuff like “The Northern Touch,” but it was amazing because that’s when we were forced to kind of examine who we were as a country, you know what I’m saying? Because to us, in Toronto especially, the country didn’t go far outside of Toronto. All of a sudden now we are really learning about Vancouver, we are really learning about Halifax and, you know what I’m saying, everything in between. It was really dope for us culturally, because that was the first time that I ever appeared on foreign television, and by foreign I mean BET, which is foreign even if you are in the States. Cheap joke, but... Yeah that’s the first time – tough crowd – first time that we were ever on BET and I remember, you know, after that, there was a time... Quick story: I was in the Beverly Center, and you know, some Latin guys rolled up on me. And I was like, “Fuck, this is way too stereotypical, like my first time to LA and I’m already going to get like fucking rolled up on by some crazy OGs?” And so they were like, “Hey man.” I was like, “What’s going on, dude?” he’s like, “Was that you in the video on BET?” I was like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah that was me” he was like, “Yo that shit’s crazy” I was like, “Oh respect!” and you know, after the urine dried in my pants, like it was dope, because I was like, “Yo,” like, you know it’s cool to have the love at home, but you know to realize like that, they not just love it, but actually respect it outside of your country’s borders, is like something super dope and again, especially at that time, because literally our country, especially for hip-hop, we had nothing. Anupa Mistry That song changed everything. I think, I mean I think for myself, for a lot of people my age, or even younger, and definitely older, that is probably the most iconic Canadian rap song of all time. Kardinal Offishall It’s so dope, knowing people like you, “Yo, I grew up on Northern Touch,” you know what I'm saying? Like when people meet me, or they see me, or whatever, and they’re like, “Yo, Northern Touch,” and I’m like “Cool, but there’s other songs”, but like you know what I'm saying. It’s dope. If somebody is going to recognize or show appreciation for something, it’s something to me that is so special because that song really wasn’t about, it wasn’t about me, and I don’t think it was about any individual artist, it was about what the song represented. You know what I’m saying? And I was just blessed to be able to communicate the hook that brought it all together and just spoke of an ideology. Anupa Mistry How did it come together? Kardinal Offishall Initially, believe it or not, the labels were going to come together and it was going to be a project that all of them got together and put out, and in regular label fashion, they did not. I remember I got a call, [in] summer. I was having a super crazy time with my allergies, like a box of Kleenex beside me, sneezing 200 times a day type shit, and they like, “Yo, we’re doing this song, can you come to studio?” And I was like, “Of course.” So, I got down to the studio, and it was myself, and Choclair, and Thrust, and I can’t remember if the Rascalz were, if they flew into town or not at that time, but I remember we were all putting it together, and we came up and put the hook, and kind of pieced it together. What’s amazing is the first time I ever heard that song, Common had come to Toronto and he had a show, and at the end of the show, you know, when everybody was leaving, it might have been DJ Kimo that ran in and, “Yo, I got the test pressing,” and I remember they put it on in the DJ booth and they played it, and like for us like it was magical you know, hearing it put together, but hearing it in a club, like it was fucking crazy. You know what I’m saying? You know, you hear a song sometimes and you just... I tell people the great songs, people ask me now, “What do you look for? Either from your work with Universal, or just being an artist? How do you go about collaborating with people and how do you know when a song is special?” Sometimes when somebody plays you something, or you hear something, you just, you can’t really describe it with words, it’s really just those vibrations that connect with you and I think that’s why that song was able to connect with so many people around the planet. Anupa Mistry It also made an industry impact in terms of the perception of what Canadian hip-hop could be, and its merit, you know? That song was nominated for a Juno Award, you guys performed that song at the Juno Awards. Before Skepta came out and mobbed out at the Brit Awards with a million guys on stage, you guys did that. Kardinal Offishall Duly noted that, we turned it down that year, because of I think the lack of respect that we felt that the Canadian industry had for hip-hop at the time. It was a thing with the Rascalz, they were like, “Yo, we want to give it back.” I was like, “What the fuck you want to do that for?” They’re like, “Because we’re trying to make a statement,” and they talked us about and I was like, “Yeah, I’m down” you know what I am saying? It was something they initiated and once they spoke to the rest of us, all of us were with it, you know what I’m saying, in terms of like politely declining. To this day, I think every time I go to the Junos, when I walk through the door, there’s still like a “Beep, Beep, Beep” because it’s like, it was a big thing, you know what I’m saying? I think it was a statement that we had to make at the time, and that’s the irony of it. Although we showed the power of what Canadian hip-hop could do, the labels at the time were still fronting on us. I think that’s why my first record deal that I signed was with MCA Records in the States. We went to every single label here, and they were all like, “We don’t really want to do it, but if we do do it, we’ll give you lunch money,” and that’s why we went to the States. Anupa Mistry Then you moved from that kind of raw sound to this. (music: Kardinal Offishall – “BaKardi Slang” / applause) Kardinal Offishall Yeah. Anupa Mistry That was your single, “BaKardi Slang,” which you put out in 2001. Kardinal Offishall Mm-hmm. Anupa Mistry You were talking about going to the States earlier. I think the first time I saw that music video was on BET, not on MuchMusic. Kardinal Offishall Mm-hmm. Anupa Mistry That’s not to say MuchMusic didn’t play it first, but that was the power of that song. Also for people who are trying to decode what Drake is saying in that song, you give us the glossary right there. Kardinal Offishall I mean, I’ll give you guys the quick story. At the time, I mean – our dollar is still shit – but at the time our dollar was really shit, so in order to get deals we used to either drive to New York, to New York City, or we would drive to Buffalo. Just depending on how much money we had and who was down to drive. There was a day when I was like, “Fuck it, let’s go to Buffalo,” and just get, you know what I mean, just go get fresh, you know what I’m saying, go get some clothes. Probably got about twenty minutes away, and back in the day – and it was, yes, on cassette – my boy Solitair, who was an MC and a producer, he was playing me the beats that he had made from the night before. That beat came on, and I stopped it and I said, “Make a U-turn, we’re going to the studio, right now, and I need that beat. And I don’t have any money to pay you, but I need it.” Yeah, my vibe at that time was always like... There’s so much to this story, but leading up to that, Saukrates got a deal with Warner Brothers, a dude named Fuzzy, who’s still in the industry till this day. Fuzzy got Saukrates a deal out at Warner Brothers, he kind of fucked that deal off, but at least he had it. Choclair, got signed to Virgin Records up here, and then got signed also, I guess, they did a joint venture with Priority Records in the States. Leading up to that, there were a series of events to where we always had to prove ourselves. So everybody knows about Sway in the Morning. Sway is on Shade 45 and MTV, and interviewed the president. Stuff like that. Anupa Mistry Talk show. Kardinal Offishall Sway had a legendary show called, him and his partner, Sway and King Tech, the Wake Up Show. If you know anything about that show, at any given time, whenever they had MCs in the house, there’s like 20 MCs. From the Bay. From LA. From wherever. Of course because we were Canadian, I remember when we went on, we were like the three last MCs. They’re like, “Put those guys last.” That happened every single place that we went in America. Like we had to prove ourselves when we went to... we killed the Sway and King Tech show. We went to... what was it called? Friday Night Flavas, I think, in LA with Mr. Choc and C-Minus, and those guys. Same thing. We used to have to go and kill it over there. When we used to go to Stretch and Bobbito’s show, like same thing everywhere we went. We had to work overtime, but it was always my dream for people to yell out my city the same way that anywhere we went... like when we went to LA, and we went to a concert they be like, “Yo is Compton in the house? What’s up from West Hollywood?” You go to New York and they talk about every borough. Brooklyn, Manhattan, blah, blah, blah. Never did anybody ever, ever say Toronto. For me, at that time, I was arrogant, and probably crazy enough to think at some point in time, I’m going to do some shit to where people are going to yell out Toronto. When I made “BaKardi Slang,” every single thing about the intent of that record was to change the way that people thought about the city that I came from, and ultimately my country. That’s literally why in the hook, “Everybody knows it’s the T dot,” cause I wanted everybody to yell that out whenever they heard that song. That’s why I also spoke about... again we were just kids from the street. I don’t mean that in the like, we were gang-banging type of shit. I mean like literally we had blue collar parents who were doing what they could to provide for us. None of us were well off. But we had this drive, and we had this idea that if we came together, and pulled our money together, that one by one we’d be able to push one guy to that next level. So that’s what we did with our independent singles. You know what I’m sayin’? If you go back and you look at the history, it’s funny. My manager was showing me, he went into this shop, and they had all these old 12”s that we had. 12”s are pieces of vinyl. On some of the pieces of vinyl, you’d see on one side would be Choclair and on the other side it would be Kardinal and Solitair. That wasn’t because of anything other than we couldn’t afford for me to have my own vinyl to myself. So we just split the money, and we’re like, “Alright, you’ll be the A side. You’ll be the B side,” type of thing. That’s literally what we did, up until I got my first deal with MCA. Then with “BaKardi Slang” I just wanted everybody to know who we were. That’s why the very first line says, “We don’t say you know what I’m sayin’. T dot says ya don’t know.” Cos where we come from, we weren’t... the shit that we would hear in the Wu Tang records and anybody. We don’t say, “You know what I’m sayin’? You know what I’m sayin’?” That shit that we would hear from New York... where we came from in Toronto man would say, “Yo. You know what I’m sayin? Yeah don’ know”. You know what I mean? That’s just who we were. It was crazy because America didn’t know what it was, really – mainstream America. But they’re like, this shit sound crazy. At the time it was really dope because you’d be in Boston and you’d hear a used car commercial come on the radio. “For the best used cars,” and that beat would be playing in the background. Or you go to LA... Anupa Mistry The “BaKardi Slang” beat? Kardinal Offishall Huh? Anupa Mistry The “BaKardi Slang” beat? Kardinal Offishall Yeah. That was the wildest thing. You’d be in LA, and they’d be talking about, “For the new cell phone plan, and you’d hear “BaKardi Slang” playing. You know what I’m saying? What was interesting... And we can go on to the next thing, but was so important for me as a person of West Indian heritage, and that has Caribbean lineage, when we went on tour I didn’t realize how powerful the song was, until we went into every city across America. All of the Caribbean people would come out of the woodwork saying, “Yo, I used to get chased and beat up after school for having an accent, and now because of this song people finally know who I am.” You know what I’m saying? It changed a lot of lives. It was really an incredible thing to witness firsthand across America. Anupa Mistry The impact of that, I think, was present in mainstream hip-hop from that point onward. The Clipse put out a song the following year that, I think, has become the definitive single of who they are. A song called “Grindin’”. But then this happened. (music: Clipse – “Grindin’ (Selector Remix)” / applause) So that was the selector remix of Clipse’s “Grindin’” featuring... Kardinal Offishall Sean Paul, random guy, and Kardinal. Yo, that is very important. It is very important to note this story. I’m in Toronto. Just coming back from the States and it doesn’t matter the name of the club. When I’m in the club in Toronto I go up the back stairwell, where the artists go, or whatever. 'Cause we’re all divas. The door opens up and it’s fucking Pharrell. I’m like, “What are you doing here?” He’s like, “Yo I’m promoting my group N.E.R.D.” I was like, “Oh shit.” He was like, “Yo I fucking love “Ol' Time Killin'.” That’s my fucking shit.” I’m like, “Yo, I fucking love what you doing with those Clipse guys. That shit is crazy.” He’s like, “Yo, we’re going to do a remix.” He’s like, “I’d love to get you on it.” Now, if you guys know anything about the industry, that’s what everybody says all the time. “Love your shit man. We should do some shit together.” 90% of the time, it doesn’t fucking happen. Unless you’re at the Red Bull Music Academy and that’s all you do is collab. Ironically, literally two days later - mind you this is before sending files over the net - I get a FedEx to the studio. Yes, it is hilarious when you think about it. I got a FedEx and I opened it up and it’s a ProTools session on three DVDs. It was the “Grindin’” files. I’m like, “Holy shit.” Literally that whole thing was done in like 15 minutes. First of all, I couldn’t believe that he actually sent it and I literally just went in, penned it, recorded it, and sent him back five DVDs. Yeah. The whole thing was done within a week. At the time, again, that was unheard of in terms of a super power. Pharrell. That was the first. You know how Pharrell did this. He peaked, he slowed down a little bit, and then he’s freaking a monster again. This was that time when The Neptunes were The Neptunes. Being able to work with them and have that opportunity, my brain just exploded at the time. That verse came out and I was laughing with Anupa because obviously if you guys didn’t recognize the voice, that’s Sean Paul at the beginning who, ironically in terms of a lot of international exposure, I played a small part... we had a song called “Money Jane” that came out maybe 1999 but that did extremely well here and abroad. Me and Sean Paul had a really good relationship since then till now. The middle guy, he was random. Honestly, I was like, “Pharrell, who is that?” It’s just one of his brethren. He’s like “Yo, giving you this shot. I’m going to throw you in between Kardinal and Sean Paul.” He was never heard of again, but he managed to take up a minute and 30 seconds of that song. Hats off to random guy, but yeah. That song was so key for me. Besides my own music, that was one of my first grand scale features that I was able to land at that time. There was this amazing thing that used to happen called the Mixshow Power Summit where people would literally gather from around the world to this amazing music conference. I remember that I performed that song. It was The Clipse, myself, and actually Super Cat that performed that song live in Puerto Rico. If you Google it, go to YouTube. I think there’s a performance of that for the Mixshow Power Summit. Those times were very, very, very exciting and incredible. Anupa Mistry You and I have talked a bit before about the impact that Canadian artists had on what was happening in mainstream American music. I want to show people what you mean a little bit when you talk about that. I’m going to play a Rascalz song, a song called “Top of the World” featuring Barrington Levy, who’s a reggae dancehall legend. Let’s listen to that. (music: The Rascalz feat. Barrington Levy – “Top Of The World”) Kardinal Offishall I actually forgot K-Os was on that song. Shout out to them. (applause) Anupa Mistry Yeah. Shout out to K-Os. That happened but then shortly after that song came out, this song came out. Listen to the hook. (music: Shyne feat. Barrington Levy – “Bad Boys”) Kardinal Offishall Depends on who you ask. It’s not necessarily an accident. Anupa Mistry Let’s explain to everyone what we heard. The first song was “Top of the World” by the Rascalz featuring Barrington Levy and then we just listened to Shyne’s “Bad Boys,” which also features Barrington Levy. Talk about the link between those two songs. Kardinal Offishall The link is my man Sol G. As a great manager should do, Sol was promoting the Rascalz’s song and album but he also used to work at Bad Boy for a certain stint. Anupa Mistry And Shyne was signed to Bad Boy. Kardinal Offishall Yep. Without getting into any click bait conversations, the Rascalz, Barrington Levy, Puffy, “Oh my god I need that.” Shyne, Barrington Levy. You can connect the dots or not, but that’s what happens. Anupa Mistry Can you talk a bit about Barrington actually? Why is Barrington so influential or iconic? Kardinal Offishall Barrington is dope because he has this weird thing in his throat that’s like a human melodyne or like a human auto tune setting. There needs to be an auto tune like a Barrington setting. The things that he can do naturally is wild. I think that’s always been his thing even before it was an actual thing. Barrington, he’s a legend and Red One from the Rascalz, Red is actually Antiguan. He has the Caribbean roots and always loved that song. The hook that they did with the Rascalz is actually a pre-existing Barrington Levy song that they just took in and he sang it over on their joint. With us, there’s always been a lot of participation from the dancehall community. Even with “BaKardi Slang” that we played earlier, it’s crazy because I got a call from this guy. I was in New York on promo and this guy calls me. He’s like, “Yo Kardi!” Like, “Who is this?” He’s like, “Yo, Kardi, I got Bounty Killer on the phone.” It’s fucking DJ Khaled who’s my, at the time... I knew Khaled for a lot of years... Anupa Mistry Before he was a Snapchat guy. Kardinal Offishall Yeah. Since the late ’90s, like, “I got Bounty on the...” He said, “I got Rodney on the phone.” You know, Bounty comes on the phone and he’s like, “Yo, Kardinal. Want to talk to you about this song “BaKardi Slang.” I love it. The way you’re taking the Jamaican slang with the English ting? I love it. Got to do a remix. Take it to the next level.” Literally, that’s what he said. Within a few days, he just happened to be in New York and myself, him, and I think Richie Stevens at the time were in the studio. The crazy thing about Bounty Killer is, you’ve probably heard these stories about other people, but he was in the studio and the beat’s playing. When you’re in the studio with people, just like studios here, you’re looking at the other person. You’re vibing. Bobbing your head or whatever. He was just like... for an hour straight. I was like... what I didn’t realize, he didn’t write anything down. Whenever he does this thing, he just does it in his head. It didn’t realize what he was doing. It was super awkward for a long time until I realized what he was doing. We ended up doing a couple collaborations. It’s dope. I went on to work with everybody from Bounty Killer to Spragga Benz to Vybz Kartel. That was actually a connection through Bounty Killer. Most recently, Masika, Stephen Marley. The dancehall community has always embraced me, and a lot of times, just always showing a lot of love and affection for the way that we’ve embraced dancehall in Canada. I think it’s super amazing because from what I told you about how difficult the scene was in Toronto, multiply that times 10, add a fire for Jamaica. It’s not bottles, though. Definitely guns. Yeah. It’s dope because thank god it was a community that had been essential for us, and it’s just great that they welcomed, pretty much like, they welcomed their sons home. I remember one of the best lines that Bounty ever said to me. We had just, when “BaKardi Slang” came out, we performed it at something called Delano’s Revenge that had 30,000 people at it. He pulled up the song “One Time,” and he said... what did he say? He said, “I want you guys to show love to Kardinal because he is of Jamaican parentage, which means we own a percentage.” That was one of the best things that I’ll never forget. It’s interesting because it happened right after 9/11 that we, 26 of us actually went down to Jamaica, including the Rascalz, so Red One, everybody was there. It was an incredible, incredible time. Yeah. Anupa Mistry The reason why I think it’s important to lay the foundation of all of that stuff, of how much your culture has influenced you and in turn, influenced the landscape of hip-hop in this country, or at least in Toronto, let’s say that, and (it) trickled back into Jamaica. That, we’re seeing that now, today. When people wonder, “What is Drake doing, or why are all of these artists from Toronto all of a sudden getting on to these sounds?” I mean, that had roots in what you’ve done. You’ve always been doing it. You’re still doing it. You put out an album last year called Kardigras, your fifth album, and you could still hear that stuff present on that record. Kardinal Offishall I mean, Drake’s a kid just like anybody else in Toronto. It’s just one of those things. It’s not like he had to reach. When people talk about authenticity, I think, to me, this is, especially in telling his story, it’s kind of hard to grow up in a place like Toronto and not, at some point in time, have that kind of leak into who you are. To me, it’s the equivalent of, I don’t know, being in New Orleans and at no point in time do you ever talk about Mardi Gras and all the cultural things that you experience through that, or being in New York and having something like the Labor Day Parade on Eastern Parkway. Having those things not, in some type of way, affect you, or pretend like you could live in Brooklyn and not ever talk about how the West Indian culture is a part of who we are. I think you’ve seen it over the years in hip-hop come at various times. You’ve seen it in Smiff N’ Wessun. You’ve seen it come through in the Fugees. You’ve seen it come through if you dip back to Heavy D, and now you’re seeing it in Rihanna and Drake and Beyonce and Justin Bieber. The Justin Bieber one is a bit of a stretch, but it all, it all is a reality. It is what it is at this point in time, and I just love the fact that Drake is on that platform and he could have veered left, but instead, he veered right and kind of started to incorporate what has always been around him, as long as I’ve known him. He’s always been in the scene, sometimes as an actor, sometimes as a musician, but I think it’s dope. Unfortunately, it’s funny because people, they say, “What is all this London slang that Drake’s trying to put into his music?” I’m like... Anupa Mistry That’s “BaKardi Slang.” Kardinal Offishall Well, I’m not that vain, but I’m like, “That’s our...” That’s just what we grew up with in the city, whether you like it or not, it’s not foreign for somebody Greek to... you’re like, “Yo Kardi, wha gwan” It’s just how we... it’s just how some of us talk. Not all of us, but it’s just within our culture. I think it’s dope that he’s representing home. That’s what it is. When I look and I see it, that’s what I see. Anupa Mistry I mean, this is a big conversation that’s happening now, and I think we are finally hearing from people in Jamaica who are maybe feeling slighted by how their music or how their culture is being represented internationally. For the young people in here making music, people watching us, making music. Do you have any words or any thoughts on how you take inspiration from other cultures, whether it’s reggae, dancehall, or whatever it may be, in a way that feels respectful to the original people? Kardinal Offishall For me, I think the best way to not have people feel that type of way, is to include them, and to be inclusive, because it’s like I travel and have traveled the world. Anything that’s inspired me, I try and have those people participate in it. My family’s from Jamaica, but I’m a huge fan of soca music. When I do, when I do soca, if it’s not something that I do with Bunji or Machel or Kes or one of my friends, there’s things that you’ll see behind the scenes. A song that I have called, "Always Carnival Time” with me and Kes, not is it just that I have an artist from Trinidad who’s heavy in the soca scene, but it’s like the engineers mixing the song are people from Trinidad and that type of a thing. I think inclusion, because it’s like, if you think about it in a Canadian type of way, whatever it is that we represent here, if people just came and they’re like, “Oh, they’re doing this cool shit in Canada,” and just left and went and did it and it became super popular, people would be like, “Yo, what the fuck? That’s Canada shit.” The same thing would happen if it was the UK with what’s going on with grime. Imagine all of a sudden, Jay Z just started doing grime, but there were no grime artists on his album, no grime producers, but he’s just taking the sound that is fundamentally a UK thing and just doing it, I’m sure there would be animosity there, too. I think what a lot of those artists are saying is it’s like you’re taking from us, and by you, I just mean people in general because there’s a lot of people that are inspired by what’s going on in dancehall, but there’s a lot of people that kind of just say, “Thanks,” and they just leave instead of actually having the people participate. I think that happens with any country, whether it be Germany, France, Jamaica, Japan, I think just as long as you have some type of inclusion, I think you’ll be able to avoid the criticism and skepticism. Anupa Mistry You mentioned soca music, one of my favorite types of music, so I was really happy when you... Kardinal Offishall Before you even play that, you see how you said, you were really happy? This is arguable in here for as long as you guys are here. I think soca is literally the only music on the planet that is 99.9% a happy genre. There is no such thing as an angry soca song. When you listen to soca, I don’t think you can play me any negativity in soca. I grew up with it. Didn’t always like it. I think when I started to fall in love with it was when hip-hop was redundant. It was lacking creativity and there wasn’t anything that was inspiring me. Getting into the soca scene was one where any soca party you would go to on the entire planet would probably be the most exciting, energetic place that you’ve ever been to and the music was just so vibrant. It gave me a second wind like when you’re at a club and the club is really shitty and it’s 2 AM but your friends don’t want to leave till 4AM. You’re like, “This fucking sucks.” Then they play music. You’re like, “I can stay.” That’s what soca music was for me. Anupa Mistry I’m not a stay out all night kind of party person but that stuff, I’ll go till 7 AM. Kardinal Offishall That’s why with carnival you go and you can get 18 hours sleep for the week. Anupa Mistry Let’s let people hear what we’re talking about. (*music: Bunji Garlin – “Truck On D Road” /applause *) That was a song by Bunji Garlin called “Truck On D Road” and you did a remix of that. That’s from I believe carnival season 2014. Kardinal Offishall Very important to note. He did the remix of it. There’s a very, very key difference because there’s a lot of times when artists’ songs come out and they call it the remix even though they did it themselves. Not really a remix. You just jacked shit. That’s actually a real remix meaning he’s like, “I’m doing a remix for this song. I’d like you to be on it.” There’s actually a process to it. Here’s my verse. Puts it together, puts it out. Anupa Mistry I also think that’s an interesting song. It’s an interesting song for us to listen to because I don’t know how many people here are familiar with soca, but I don’t know if that necessarily sounds like what people know as soca. It reflects the increasing influence of EDM on soca culture in Trinidad, which has a lot to do with how that’s its own self sustaining industry. Kardinal Offishall Bunji is doing what I did and am doing with hip-hop. For Bunji, he doesn’t like for soca to live in a box. His artistry, he doesn’t want to be the typical, (singing) “Everything happy, everything good. Jump, jump, jump.” He wants to try and inject a little bit more creativity and more lyricism into it. That’s probably why, and I’m saying he’s one of my best friends and why we get along so well musically. Some of you guys might have been introduced to Bunji through Skrillex or Major Lazer or a lot of big EDM bands and producers because a lot of them have been going to Bunji the last few years and doing collabs. People are starting to reach for Machel now. There’s an interesting thing that’s happening with the soca scene. I love it because to them, Trinidad is similar to where we were in Toronto. If you talk to Bunji nowadays, his fight is: he wants for people to respect Trinidad and to respect soca music even though people love it around the world. It’s similar to where we were with the Toronto hip-hop scene is we wanted for the Toronto hip-hop scene to be accepted. Maybe accepted is a bad word because I think when we came in, my whole mindset was like, we’re going to seek and destroy and bomb up everything until they’re like, “Oh shit, we got to pay attention.” What’s interesting was that was always my frame of mind whether it was doing a song with Vybz Cartel or T-Pain or Sean Kingston, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Akon. Anybody that I ever did a song with, I was always going in there with the intention of, “This is amazing that these people have me on the song, but at the same time they’re going to mother fucking respect Toronto.” I think that’s the same mindset that he’s in now with soca and with Trinidad. It’s amazing because he just got back from France doing another collab. They’re doing so much shit over there in soca. It’s amazing because it’s starting to permeate between Afro beats and all these different things that are combining soca into African rhythms and also blending EDM at the same time. I love the international sound that’s happening in hip-hop and other genres also. Anupa Mistry We’ll close up soon. All of this stuff, all of this accumulation of knowledge, all of this understanding of what it means to work in the Canadian music industry to make links with people in different parts of the world that feel organic and that have homes, have audiences where you live, meaning ostensibly I hope you’re now carrying that into what you do, your day job. Would it be safe to call it your day job? Kardinal Offishall No. Anupa Mistry OK. It’s not your day job. You’re still making music but tell everyone what else it is that you do. Kardinal Offishall It’s easy to sum up, kind of. Last year, I was doing a charity fashion show during Toronto men’s fashion week. When I was walking on the catwalk, I was walking back and I saw, “rapper, executive and philanthropist.” I was like, “Oh, that’s pretty much it right there.” There’s still the artist side, which is the rapper, the producer, the songwriter. Now I’m also part of a squad called the Celebrity Marauders, which has somebody from Cipha Sounds who’s signed to Jay Z. He’s from New York. It has Dready, who’s a legendary producer from the UK. Then it has myself. I started from scratch. We’ve been touring the world. If you’re going to be in New York tomorrow, we’ll be playing tomorrow. There’s all of that stuff. There’s the executive side to where I’m the executive creative director of A&R for Universal Music here. I just signed my first group a few months ago. I won’t let you guys leave without hearing what it sounds like. I had that fancy, nonsensical title for three years but I didn’t sign anybody until just a couple of months ago because I was waiting for somebody or some people that I thought had that superstar potential. Then there’s the philanthropic side wherein myself and my wife, we have an organization called 30 Elephants that’s a not-for-profit. My wife grew up as a navy brat and understands the importance of travel and being able to go to different places and how being exposed to different cultural rituals, really, being able to go to China, go to The Philippines, go to Africa, when you go to these different places and you see how different people live, not only are you now understanding that the way that you operate is not the only way to do something, but it also gives you a greater appreciation for what you have back home. We partner together with the Kielburgers, who have an organization called Free the Children. I work very hard together with them to create an annual trip to where we take kids, primarily that wouldn’t be able to afford a trip to Kenya, and we take them to Africa and we build schools. We build clinics. We go into the community. We volunteer. It’s a really transformative trip. That’s mainly what I do on the philanthropic side. I’ll also be touring with them to a stadium near you for a thing that we have called We Day that happens at pretty much every major stadium in North America as well as the UK and other places. Anupa Mistry You were... your role as Executive Creative Director, for three years, and you didn’t sign anyone until a few months ago, so what was it that you were waiting for? Kardinal Offishall It wasn’t... Anupa Mistry Not to say money, I mean what was the spirit, what was... Kardinal Offishall You’re like, “What was it you were waiting for?” The funny thing is that I’ve been A&Ring my whole career and my whole life, so pretty much anything that you’ve heard for the most part was myself that went and found this person and said, “I believe in them.” It’s been crazy being able to, over the years, discover, not discover, but Estelle... before she was Estelle, me and her were working, because I knew her from the UK. Glenn Lewis was on my demo tape, Sean Paul was on my demo tape, before these people went on and sold gold and platinum albums and all that, and it was my lawyer, Theo Sedlmayr, and my manager Mr. Morgan at the time, it’s like, “Yo, you’ve been in A&R your whole career. It’s just that you never got paid for it.” Shout out to Randy Lennox, who was the former president, and also the current president Jeffrey Remedios for giving a rapper the opportunity to actually have influence and be able to sign, because a lot of times, there are certain A&Rs that actually don’t have the signing power. I think it’s really dope that they believe in me, what I’ve been able to accomplish within my career, and also for me to, I guess, be able to see what the future might look like, give me that power. The other group that I signed, they’re incredible, and pretty much to go with my legacy, they’re international. Eestbound, who is originally from the Netherlands, so he’s Dutch, he moved to Toronto about five to six years ago. If you don’t know who Eestbound is, he produced “Antidote” for Travis $cott along with “Wonder Girl.” Also, there’s Milly Manson, who is a rapper. He’s like me. He’s of Jamaican heritage. There is Pree, who is an 18-year-old female Sri Lankan, and it sounds crazy, but together, they mix organically. I mean, they also live five minutes away from each other in Brampton. Just the mix of all of them, when I heard this song, I played the song 50 times in a row because my sound engineer, he’s like, “I need you to hear my little brother,” and I was like, “Oh boy, here we go again.” You know, he pressed play, and probably the first 10 seconds, in my head, I’m killing myself. When it kicked in, it’s like what I was talking about earlier. When you hear that song, and there’s those vibrations that, that thing that’s just organic, that thing that just takes over you. When I heard this song, I knew that this was something crazy. What’s amazing is the song just dropped a week ago, but the reception has been just out of this world. I’m super, super, super hyped for what these kids are going to do, and also what they’re going to represent. I think they really represent what Toronto is, an amalgamation of cultures, of styles, and I think it’s dope because although they are all 21 and younger, their sound also is able to permeate the old, bitter men of hip-hop. I think that ...yeah, another hard room, cheap joke. Yeah, I think it’s going to be dope because we performed it for the first time last week. When I say we, I mean I was cheering from the back. They killed it. The crowd was super receptive from just having heard the song for the first time, and that’s really been the reaction. Can I play this shit for you guys? Audience Yeah. Kardinal Offishall Like, I think... Anupa Mistry Then, we’ll go to questions. Kardinal Offishall Then, we’ll go to questions. Yeah, mean, I was... it’s just one of those ones for me where I was like, “Ugh.” It has the “yuck.” You just do the “yuck” face when you hear it, but I think in a really good way. The kids represent what I feel is happening right now. There’s a lot of aggression. There’s a lot of misplaced anger, a lot of different stuff, and I think it all comes out in this song. Not to mention, I think individually, they’re stars as well. The group is called EMP, stands for Eestbound, Milly, and Pree, and pardon me, Red Bull gas. That’s called... the song is called “Rebellion.” (music: EMP – “Rebellion” / applause) Anupa Mistry Thank you for taking the time to hang out with us today and talk about all this amazing stuff. Kardinal Offishall Please, this is dope. Listen, first and foremost, any time Red Bull calls I always oblige, whether it’s being a part of Sound Clashes in New York or stuff in Toronto, here in Montréal, whatever, I think first and foremost, we should give a big round of applause to Red Bull Music Academy for ever having this shit happen (applause). The one thing about me that I always feel is important is, especially in hip-hop, I feel that there is a little bit of a disconnect between generations right now. I think that it’s important that not just my story, but the story of hip-hop be able to connect the young kids that are coming up with what actually happened before, because I really am a real believer in: You can’t understand where you’re going if you don’t know where you came from. None of us, including myself, just got here one day. We’re all standing on the shoulders of giants. It’s just that sometimes, I think what’s happening right now with kids is that there’s these giants, but they’re standing on... they’re holding up these platforms and the kids are standing on the platforms, but they’re unaware of the people that are actually underneath that are holding up that foundation. I think any time, even if it’s a little bit of my story and a little bit of Toronto’s story and a little bit of Canada’s story, that can lend itself to everybody’s understanding. I mean, arguably, the biggest rapper in the world is from Toronto. By saying that, it’s the same way that I know New York’s story because so many different people have told it. It goes way back from the seventies up until now. I would love for people to have the same understanding of where we come from when they’re talking about Drake or they’re talking about Weeknd or they’re talking about Tory Lanez or Alessia Cara or any of the other countless amazing Canadian acts that we have. I would really love for people to understand what our legacy is and where we came from as a country and how we were able to arrive as opposed to just people just running with the hype saying, “Yeah, Toronto’s the hot shit right now.” It’s so much more than just headlines on blogs. Anupa Mistry That’s a fitting, fitting end. (applause) Yeah. Thank you. Questions? Where’s the microphone, the question? Microphone. Does anyone have questions? You’re going to get a mic. Audience Member I got a question. Anupa Mistry Oh, you got a mic? Kardinal Offishall Who let this guy in? Audience Member Alright, settle a household argument for me. Is “BaKardi Slang” somewhat at least partially inspired by “Country Grammar”? Kardinal Offishall It came out before that. Audience Member It did? Kardinal Offishall Sure did. Audience Member Shit, I lost. I lost the bet. Fuck. Kardinal Offishall I also wore the furry Kangol before Nelly did. Shout out to Nelly, though. Audience Member You just cost me a thousand dollars. Damn it. Kardinal Offishall Yeah. Sorry about that, bro. Anupa Mistry Go ahead. Audience Member Hi. I would like to ask two questions, but it’s going to be a joined question of sorts. You mentioned about how the Toronto scene is a bit tough when people are throwing bottles and stuff onstage back in your day? How is it now? Is there any difference between then and now? The following question to that is, is the Canadian industry more understanding of you or the current artists after you’ve gone to the US? Yeah, so that’s the question. Kardinal Offishall The Canadian industry, that’s another two-hour discussion. Where we’re at right now is very interesting because you have forward thinkers like the people that allow me to work with Universal, those people that actually do believe in the talent that we have. It’s like over the past few years, if you look at the first three: Alx Veliz, who is a Latin artist. You have people like Jazz Cartier that’s on tour with Post Malone right now. You have EMP that just dropped. These are just three signings that happened all just within the last year. Clearly people are really starting to understand the importance of not letting other territories come in and just farm within Canada and take it back to America or take it back to the UK. Traditionally, that’s what happens if you look at people like [inaudible], you look at Drake, you look at The Weeknd, Bieber, and unfortunately the list goes on. Basically what happens is you have a lot of people who historically were able to offer budgets that were ten times what Canadians could afford, so there is more to it than just the belief in the actual music. There is economics behind it, but what’s dope right now is that we are showing and proving so much in all these different things that have happened and that are happening now, it’s making it really dope. There are people that are starting to understand that this is what the kids have always loved and this is what the kids love now, but we’re just starting to keep it at home here in Canada. I mean, not even to toot my own horn or it’s not a vanity thing or a conceit thing, but it’s like even the things that people are allowing me to do myself through my career, I couldn’t have imagined this stuff 15 years ago, you know what I’m saying? I’m doing a partnership with Ford on the philanthropy side to where I’m going to be a Ford ambassador and I’m going to work with them to create... we created this program that hopefully will start in December, but that’s called Drivers of Change. It’s a program to where they are going to give a national spotlight every month to somebody that’s actually doing work within the community, you know what I’m saying? It was an idea that I came up with, so it’s like they’re now saying, “Hey, these hip-hop guys, they not only know how to get the attention of the youth and know how to create businesses for themselves, but they can actually help us to further get our brands out there.” It’s going to be announced this week when I’m going to have a nationally syndicated show on Virgin Radio from coast to coast. It’s unheard of, especially if you listen to Virgin Radio, you know that that doesn’t really necessarily fit what your image would be of Virgin in your head. It’s the same thing. It’s like, little by little, these doors get kicked down. We just get through and as soon as we get through, there’s some people that whatever rightfully so do it for themselves and they have a great career and they make a lot of money and they do their thing, but then there’s some people that want to be able to initiate change. I think I’m one of those people. My legacy will, I guess, speak to you when you can see 10, 15, 20 and 30 years from now, somebody being like, “Oh my God, I’m able to provide not only for my family, but I was able to do more than that, provide for my family and my community.” It all traces back to that first thing that you did when you kicked down this door or you did this. I think what’s happening is the Canadian industry is really starting to understand the power that hip-hop music has and the role that our community plays. If you ask about what Toronto’s like now, it’s soft, but it’s soft in a good way. There’s a lot more opportunity for kids. Yeah, it’s weird. Well, here’s the thing... People talk about gatekeepers nowadays. People talk about, “Oh, the gatekeepers, the old regime, they got to go. Make room for everybody else.” What I liked about the gatekeepers... because I was part of that same thing. I had to prove to the gatekeepers that I was dope. Toronto, yes, it was a little bit more harsh, but it kept the bullshit at home, you know what I’m saying? If you were garbage, it wasn’t, “Oh, there’s room for everybody.” We’re like, “No, we got to preserve our culture.” What happened that I can’t remember the year in particular, but I think it started, to be honest, with the term hating. People were like, “Oh, you’re just hatin’ on him,” you know what I’m saying? “Let him do his thing.” I think what we were doing was we were preserving for the most part... there’s always going to be bullshit that gets through, but a certain standard, a certain level. The other day, we had this conversation that opened my eyes to something. If you look at going from Melle Mel to Rakim, there’s a change in the way that they rapped. The thing was that Rakim, you can’t really argue. Whether you like him or not, his skill level, it was up here. The bar was up here (raises his hand). From Rakim to Nas, whether you like Jay Z better than Nas or whatever the scenario was, from Rakim to Nas, again, there is a difference in the way that they rapped, but in terms of the bar, up here. If you go from a Nas to a Kendrick or somebody like that, again, a difference in the way that they rap, but still the bar is up here (rasies his hand). There’s always going to be younger people that come in and do it differently, but the bar is up here. What’s happening in hip-hop because we don’t have the gatekeepers, the bar is way down here. That’s why I say it’s cool because it gives more people opportunity, but at the same time, without those people that are organically curating what they want the culture to be, it’s letting a lot of bullshit get through. There’s people that’ll be like, “Oh, it’s not bullshit because you don’t like it.” That’s bullshit. I think honestly, hip-hop was something that literally started with the DJ, in terms of the rap music anyway. It started with the DJ and the MC at first was secondary, was the accompanying instrument to the DJ, but the one thing that was the common thread was that it was lyrical. They used to call us “street poets.” They used to say it’s this street poetry... you can break it down to a science. It’s literally being studied in universities around the world. There is a science to hip-hop and there is a commonality between the best things that have risen to the top. If you look at the culture the way that it is now, it’s like there’s a regression. There’s no way, if you just put it on paper, put the way that I feel and you feel and she feels and he feels, put it to the side, put it up here and put the lyrics up there. Then study intonations, study the whole nine yards, it’s regressing. Audience Member Yes, hi, I wanted to ask you in the same vein as the first question from [inaudible]. I heard the phrase once that said, “There are music business people and business business people.” How has your relationship been with the people that really care about the music and the art versus the people who only care about the money and the institutions and the record labels and the people within the record labels especially. Since you’ve gotten to live the whole transition between a moment in time where the record industry was selling CDs or cassettes, or was really selling the physical thing and now, for example, Red Bull Music Academy which isn’t like a record label per se, but it’s still doing things for the music. Let’s say real musicians. How has your relationship been with these two sides of it? Kardinal Offishall It’s very, very, very, very difficult to balance. To be honest, the first thing before I even got this position they were like, “Kardi, we want you to have your own record label.” I was like, “Not interested. Keep it.” When we got to having the meetings, again, it just shows you the mindset that we are progressing to, but they allowed me to be able to participate but under my own terms. I was still able to be a functioning artist. They never said to me, “You have to be in the office every day and sit behind the desk and answer random calls of people who want you to sign them and stuff like that.” It’s tough because there are people that, unfortunately, only see what we call “the bean counters”... there’s only people that see the money side of it and that’s all they see. The bottom line is literally it. I mean, shout out, to Lucienne and all those people that gave Jeffrey remedials. In my case, gave me the opportunity to be president because one, he’s only a year older than me, which is crazy because when you think of presidents of labels sometimes you think of these old guys, but there’s a lot of younger presidents that are coming into power, number one. Number two, Jeffrey comes from... he had his own independent record label that was called Arts & Crafts. He already had the mindset of somebody who was very much involved in everything his artists did. If you know anything about the independent scene compared to the major label scene there’s a fundamental difference in how they operate. Yeah, you lose a lot of sleep sometimes, bro, to be completely honest. You lose a lot of sleep. There’s many people that I think are super dope and I’m like, “Yo, the label... it’s not for you with what you’re doing,” but I think that’s the dope part, kind of where we are within music. There’s so many different opportunities for your music to get heard and you can have a career and not just one where you’re just getting by, you can really come up and do extremely well around the world based on all the tools we all have at our disposal right now. I still remember I was in Jimmy Iovine’s office when that whole Soulja Boy thing was coming about. It’s crazy because within my discovery he was one of the first artists that was literally able to be discovered by double clicking. That was really one of the first ones that used the power of Internet and YouTube and that whole nine to launch their career in a big way. I remember, it was weird because Jimmy was pissed. At the time he was like, “Fuckin’ Youtube. They’re fuckin’ up everything and blah, blah, blah.” He was going on and on and on, but it’s very interesting for me to be around at that time because that’s literally where we are now. Streaming is fueling the industry, but he was concerned about that back in whenever I signed that deal... like 2007, 2008. Now people look at him and he’s with Apple Music and did that whole thing. This is something that’s been on his brain for almost a decade. Where we are right now we really have the opportunity to flourish. If you’re going to be with a label, it’s got to be because you did your research and you know what a label can do for you. It’s not just something you aspire to because all your favorite artists signed a record deal. You’ve got to look at it now and say, “Alright, this is what I am as a brand. What can that label do to enhance that vision and enhance my brand?” I think that’s when things are magic, is when there’s a true partnership. I think if there wasn’t that partnership I don’t think I’d be able to work with the labels, but I think right now that’s what’s going on is there's more and more understanding that the power lies within the artists as well as the label. When that true partnership happens that’s when great things seem to happen throughout the world. Anupa Mistry Any more questions? OK, the mic is coming. Kardinal Offishall That awkward long walk to the mic. Audience Member Good evening. Kardinal Offishall Hey, how are you? Audience Member Good. How are you? Kardinal Offishall Pretty good. Audience Member Good. What do you think about the persecution of ritual, both domestically and abroad, not just as it pertains to cultural singularities but also the threats posed by the Trans-Pacific Partnership and things like that. What do you think about ritual and mysticism versus monoculture? Kardinal Offishall Oh, man. The funny thing is I talk about monocultural experiences all the time because I loved growing up being, however old I was, and them saying, “Thriller is coming on MTV Tuesday night at 7:30,” because Tuesday night at 7:30 the entire planet was experiencing that video at the same time. Everybody at 7:38 was either on their phones or in their neighborhood or the next day in school or at work everybody was talking about it at the same time. Growing up, that’s what made so many of us fall in love with music is not just the music that came out but that experience that you had when everybody would, collectively as a lover of whatever song it was or whatever movie it was, when everybody experienced things at the same time I think that helped really push the music ahead. Growing up, that’s the way I experienced things. Everybody around me, friends, family, everybody. I think what’s happening now is it’s... I don’t know... it’s interesting. It depends on who you are. It leads to more people having an individualistic way of approaching everything. There’s not as much follow the leader. There is, like when you look at social media, literally there’s a follow button but if you can forget about those overt things I think covertly what’s happening is there’s not as much following in terms of, “Everyone loves this so I’m going to love that.” Nowadays I do interviews and people are like, “What are you listening to, “ and I’m like, “You guys need to delete that out of your journalism because it’s like I listen to a hundred artists a week.” That just comes from, you know, Anupa could be like, “The new Jay Z just dropped.” I’m like, “OK, cool, I’ll check it when I get back to my hotel.” You know what I’m saying? Those types of experiences don’t happen. I love the ritualistic, like that’s me. I’ll never trade that for anything. The first time getting to hear “The Bridge Is Over” by KRS-One my whole neighborhood heard it for the first time at the same time. Having those types of experiences that just shapes, for me, the way that my generation viewed music, the way that we viewed our goals. I love the idea of a monoculture, to some extent, still. Your question was really great. I hope I answered it or part of it, at least. Audience Member Part of it. Kardinal Offishall OK, cool. What was the other part that I didn’t answer? Audience Member I’ve kind of related to what you said about your philanthropy with the kids and taking them abroad to see other cultures, it was kind of related to that. That’s for kids, right? You said it’s a youth program? Kardinal Offishall Yeah, generally speaking from 14 to 19 or 20. Audience Member I think, at least in my head, I was thinking that stuff could benefit people of all ages. It’s not really a youth-centric thing. I think everyone could benefit from that kind of... Kardinal Offishall It is available to everybody. There are adult trips that go, probably even more than the youth trips. The reason why I felt that I wanted to engage with the youth side of it is that I know that at my age right now in order for you to change the way I think, it’s going to take years, years, and years of somebody hitting me in my head over and over again until I’m like, “Oh, I got it.” When I went there, I remember it was myself, my mom and one of the board members. We were sitting in the middle of the Maasai Mara at 12 and the electricity cut off at 11 so we’re sitting in the dark just with flashlights and we were like, “Imagine how dope this would be if we got to experience this at 13 or 14? By the time we were this age who knows what the possibilities could be or how our minds would have developed.” That’s why, initially, when we got back we wanted to make this trip available to the youth because I really do believe that the youth will be the ones that will be taking care of all of us in this room. What better way to prepare the youth than to have them go and experience those types of things firsthand so that when they come back here all the decisions that they make for the rest of their lives are affected by that one very transformative trip that they had. The thing is, we love Kenya and we go to Kenya every year but we’ve gone to Japan, we’ve gone to other places to experience those cultures because I think that’s one of the best things about being an artist, especially for me, is having toured India, having gone to China, Romania, Mexico, the Caribbean, you name it, and experiencing all those different places... the foods, the people, meeting the poor people, meeting the very wealthy people, all those different things definitely have an effect on how I view the planet and the words that I say and the actions that I do. Audience Member Thank you. Kardinal Offishall You’re welcome. Anupa Mistry Any more questions? Kardinal Offishall Good. Anupa Mistry OK, cool. Kardinal Offishall We can do that awkward applause now. (applause) Just to end it off for me, I wanted to say thank you guys for sitting through my rambling but also just for being a part of molding what the future of the industry will be. Looking at this room, for me this is dope. It’s like I see several different, I don’t know you guys, you guys could all be from [inaudible] I don’t know but looking at you guys I see several different backgrounds, I see different genders. I see a lot of different people that are coming together for the love of the arts and I think that’s something that is, for me, I can breathe a big sigh of relief because I think people like you guys that aren’t just creating sounds but creating the environment for where music will exist moving forward, I think it’s really dope that you guys even took the time out to hear just some of the stories as to where it came from. Especially coming from Canada, so I thank you guys for coming out and for doing what you guys do so round of applause for yourself. (applause) And just big up Anupa. She is, even before I knew who she was, she is somebody who is super awesome and somebody that is really engaged within the music community. When they told me that she was going to be leading this today for me, even though I know her now, it’s still an honor. Please make some noise for Anupa. (applause)

Ka
Ka witnessed the genesis of hip-hop growing up in Brownsville, Brooklyn. He learned how to become a rapper first with Natural Elements and later as half of Nightbreed. But it wasn't until his first album, Iron Works, made its way to GZA that things began to change after the Wu-Tang MC had him guest on his 2008 track “Firehouse.” By the time Ka’s next LP, Grief Pedigree, dropped in 2012, he’d honed his stark, minimal style to perfection and has been acclaimed for it since. In control of everything – rhymes, beats, videos, distribution – Ka is a single-minded force in rap. Sitting with Jeff “Chairman” Mao at the 2016 Red Bull Music Academy, Ka talks about growing up in Brownsville, the escapism of art, and the patience needed to find and accept your own voice.
Hosted by Jeff Mao We’re very excited to welcome this gentleman here sitting next to me on the couch. He’s a producer, MC, video director, a great writer, but more importantly, a model of perseverance, I think. Won’t you please welcome Ka. Ka Thank you, I appreciate it. Thank you, Red Bull, for having me. Thanks Jeff, for another opportunity sitting and chat with you. I appreciate the people. I know y’all don’t know who I am, so thanks for even being patient and coming back in the room. Jeff Mao You’re too modest. I’ve told you this before, but you’re too modest. You make music that is deeply personal. People have used different adjectives to describe it, but I’m kind of curious to know: you, yourself, how would you describe it to the folks in the room here? Ka To me, it’s therapeutic. If I wasn’t doing it, then I’d probably be crazy. Not saying I’m not crazy now, but I’d be more crazy if I wasn’t able to just vent and just get all the stuff out and just kind of purge, and that’s what each album is, it’s like a purge. I can chill and be normal for a little while until it’s pent up again and I have to do it again. It’s more personal than anything. Jeff Mao I would like to just reset our ears with a piece of music from Ka. This is from… Ka Please don’t boo. Jeff Mao This is from his most recent release, which is entitled Honor Killed The Samurai, and it is called “Conflicted.” (music: Ka – “Conflicted” / applause) Ka Thank you, I appreciate that. Thank you. Jeff Mao I wanted to play this song because it’s kind of a fitting introduction, in a way, to you. Lays out a number of different things about your subject matter, themes you explore. Sound of it as well. What do you feel this song evokes? Ka Well, it was the first song on the new album, and it’s like every album I do… I introduce… People that don’t know me, so every album is a new album. It’s the introduction of me to someone, so I want them to know the duality of man, and I’m showing you this in a song, so that was… My mother always told me to be good, my father was… Not that he ain’t tell me to be good, but he was… My father was a hood dude. I’m from Brownsville, Brooklyn. I don’t know if anybody familiar with that. I’m from a time in Brooklyn before the gentrification, it was rough out. I was in high school in ’86, I’m sure some of you wasn’t even born in ’86, but I saw a lot, and a lot of the gutter things that was going on, I was dealing with, and mother was telling me… Was trying to protect me from it. My father was trying to protect me from it, another way… By taking an offensive stance at it, so it was like I’m hearing it from both sides. “Be a good boy,” from Mom, and then Pop’s like, “Well, you got a gun, right?” It was things like that with those going on for me, and I just… that was just a song for that. Jeff Mao You have a different theme or motif that you explore on your most recent albums, I guess the last three or four. Honor Killed The Samurai is the title of this project. I’m just curious as to what it was about that culture that drew you to it. What was compelling about that that you could relate to? Ka I really like… Every album, I’m like, trying to learn. I’m reading more now, I’m trying to… I wasn’t really too good in school, so now this is my opportunity to become a smarter man or whatever, so every album is like, I’m doing an album to do an album, but I’m also like, “Yo, I can study now and learn,” so I was diving into… Growing up, I was into karate flicks, and then I saw the Japanese flicks where it wasn’t all the pageantry of the karate flicks, it was just one sword swipe, the fight is over. As a kid, I was like, “This ain’t exciting,” but growing up I was like… This became dope to me, so I just started diving into what a samurai was, and their code of honor. I was like, “This is just dope.” I started getting into it more and more, and I’m on it now. I think them taking their lives for honor was just something that I felt like I was doing for my art. The aspect of hip-hop that I do, I pride myself in the lyrics. I feel like that’s not really important as much any more in the art of hip-hop. It’s a lot more style now, and who you are, but just that pen. I want my pen to be perfect. That’s what I’m striving to be, an amazing writer. Nobody really cares about that, really, in the art right now, but I care about it, so I’m going to make sure that I’m right. It’s like… In samurai perspective, I’m hurting my, maybe, career, maybe from [the perspective of] onlookers. Me, I’m good, but from other people, “You writing all these rhymes, but you not on the radio,” but I don’t really care about that. I’m doing what I want to do. The honor and the samurai thing, I’m taking my life, in a way, to treasure what I treasure, so that’s what that was from. Jeff Mao What does honor mean to you? Do you see it out here? Is it something in life as you encounter people here and there that you feel that there’s a shortage of, or is it just something you embraced because of your own experiences? Ka I’ve always been around people of honor, and to me it’s just you following your path and not compromising. That’s just… This is my passion, this is what I want to do. It’s not what’s popping right now, but am I going to… A person of honor is going to do what they do, regardless to what the outside is saying, so that’s me. I’m doing what I do regardless of what the noise might be. That’s honorable. It’s artistically honorable to me. I’m not a sociable dude, as far as peers. I speak to a couple cats but on the whole I’m not really in the mix. Everybody that I know, honorable as far their music but I don’t know the outside of what hip-hop is, I don’t know. I would hope that they doing their passion, I would hope. Jeff Mao You mention Brownsville, Ho’ and Saratoga. Ka Hopkinson and Saratoga. I don’t think they call it Hopkinson anymore but I always call it Hopkinson. I think they call it Thomas S. Boyland but that’s the block I was raised on, Ho’ Street. That’s the block that molded me to be who I am. Saw a lot of things on that block. Did a lot of things to rep that block when I was a kid. 63 Hell St. was the address. It was a different kind of living back then. Jeff Mao I’d like to run the first video if we can, just to give us a little bit of additional context on Brownsville. This is a little bit before, probably a little bit before your time. Still setting the atmosphere of what was going on. If you could run that first video that would be great, thank you. (video: Life Inside A New York ghetto 1971) That’s 1971. Ka I was born in ’72. Jeff Mao Obviously, these things did not disappear in 1972. Ka Not that fast. Jeff Mao … Or in the years immediately after. What do you recall just on a day to day level, just living life as a kid amongst these circumstances? Ka It’s funny because when you born and raised in that you don’t even notice something is wrong. Until I started watching Different Strokes. I was like, “We don’t live like that. What is this right here?” That was just normal. I used to play in abandoned buildings with my friends. I caught the ringworms in the lot next door. I used to be able to see five blocks down, just through lots. It’s what it was. It was different, it was a different... I can’t even explain, to explain it to people who were just like, what is... I’m sure y’all were appalled by that but that was, “Oh yeah, that’s Chester St. Of course it look like that.” I didn’t know until I got older that I was fucked up, nahmean. Just having my whole formative years of going through that, of course I’m damaged from that. The art right now is helping me heal through that. I would get candy from the dope fiends because the dope fiends, if you don’t know, they always like candy after their high. I would get candy from the dope fiends. Then the dope went away and the crack heads came. It was a lot of drugs, a lot of violence and it was crazy but that’s what made me. Jeff Mao Do you remember the moment when crack hit? Ka Oh yeah, I remember. I remember it was like gradual. Everything’s weed and then dope and then cocaine started moving in. The fly kids were on cocaine. They used to be smoking woo's and bones. The Wu-Tang songs you hear them talking about woo's right? They would gut a cigarette out of the tobacco and fill it with cocaine and smoke it. A bone, they would sprinkle some coke in the weed, in the joint and they would blow. Then they started sniffing coke and then I think that Richard Pryor thing, when he was freebasing, the making of crack. I hope I’m not giving y’all no drug lesson, y’all don’t need that. (laughs) They was freebasing and then the freebasing went to crack, which was a quicker form of it. As a kid I used to see the vials on the corner. I knew some other kids younger than me they used to be picking up, “I got a bunch of red ones, I got a bunch of blue ones, I got a bunch of gold ones.” They would be picking up crack vials. I knew the smell like that funny smell, that’s crack. The name crack came from the crackling of the... when they smoked it, it would crackle, so they called it crack. If you thought that was bad it got even worse. It was worse than that in the ’80s, it was a nightmare. It was prostitutes on the corner of my block. Then unfortunately, I was in a house with a lot of us. It was at least 13 of us in the house. Of the 13, if you never lived with a crack head, B, don’t ever live with a crack head. They will steal everything you have. From the transition of being cool and recreational drugs, to smoking crack and then now you’re a crack head, it was wack living. Jeff Mao When did music become something that captivated you? Ka Again, I was born at the right time where disco was dying and hip-hop came about. Whatever this hip-hop shit was. They were speaking to me. It was more like, party, party music, party music. I told you before, soon as I was hearing Melle Mel talk about, “Bill collectors at my door, scare my wife when I’m not home,” and all that. “I can’t walk through the park because it’s crazy after dark, keep my hand on my gun because they got me on the run.” I was like, “Oh, they talking to me.” This is what I’m seeing. I’m not going to no parties, I’m out here in the street and it’s rough. That’s when it became an escape. As a young kid I was like, “Let me write a little something and try to be a rapper.” Then it became, that was the way for me to pull away from all the shit I’m seeing and just get my composition book and write. I’ve been doing this forever and that’s helped me out. Jeff Mao You were seeing these things happening around you, at what point were you participating in any of this stuff? Ka Oh early, early. I was the youngest of the cousins, I had a lot of role models, bad role models obviously. They were in it, they selling coke, they selling crack. I’m being broke. I speak to my cousin, La, “How we going to sell some... I need some money too. I like that beeper you got. These new shoes, I want that too.” I got introduced into just selling drugs. I didn’t have to go far to learn. I just talked to him like, “Yo, what we doing? How we doing this?” I got into it. I didn’t like it because it was weird to me. Put like this, my cousins were selling drugs, my aunt was on drugs, my cousin was selling drugs, his sister was on drugs, his brother was on drugs. In the house, we had drug dealers and drug takers, all in the same house, it was just a weird dynamic. I’m seeing this, like, “Yes, I want to get money,” but, “Yes, also, somebody’s destroying my household, too, by just doing the same thing.” It was like, you know, should I be greedy? Or should I be, you know like, a... I mean, I was young, this was too much to process at fucking 12 years old, like you know what I’m saying. I’m just like, “All right, fuck it, let’s just go make money,” and, you know, “Let’s walk around with guns because that’s what everybody is doing and we’re not fighting no more, we gone have to start shooting each other,” and that’s just what it was. It was weird. Me, I was thrown in. Jeff Mao Yeah. Ka I’m surprised I’m here right now, so, it’s good that I survived all that. Jeff Mao I mean, it’s important to mention, because I think from the outside, you know, people who may have a more conservative perspective on things will say, “Well just don’t, don’t get involved.” And it’s not that simple. Ka Oh yeah, it’s not that simple, it’s like, you want to be the sucker? You want to be the sucker in Brownsville? I don’t think so. I mean, you don’t want to be the sucker wherever you are from. To be a sucker, where there’s a bunch of predators, that ain’t it. I wasn’t a sucker... I’m going to do it, I’m going to do what we’re doing. This is what we’re doing? I’m doing that. You know what I mean? Just to be, not ostracized in the neighborhood, you know like, yeah, you know, we got guns, we got guns, too, so whatever. Jeff Mao I mean, Mike Tyson was from Brownsville? Ka Yeah. Jeff Mao He got picked on. Ka Yeah, exactly. That’s what made him Tyson, right, somebody like snapped the neck on one of his birds and he went, he became Tyson, you know what I mean? (laughs) See, when I was young, Tyson was already like boom, Tyson was a multimillionaire. I remember Tyson coming through the block one day, nice you know, he had this... He might have come in the limo, which was classy back then, limousines, and there was a dude on the corner, his name was Meat, and he had a pigeon coop on the corner, on the roof, and Tyson came to him, messed with the pigeons, even came to him Thanksgiving and gave like, some turkeys out, good dude, man, good dude. Jeff Mao So, when did you actually have the ambition to record, to take the rhyming thing more seriously? You said it was an escape, you know. When did, how did that gradually become more important to you? Ka One of my cousins, who was getting money, he saw that… I’m in my book, you know, “What are you writing? What are you writing all the time?” Older cousin, my cousin Deon, the man. He was like, “What are you writing man?” I’m like, “I’m just writing my little raps.” “Let me hear something, let me hear something.” I was, I wasn’t good, but he was my family, he loved me, so he was just like, you know, as you tell little shorty, to encourage him, “Yo, that’s good,” you know what I’m saying, just keep getting better. Again, like I said, he was doing his thing, he was getting money, he gave me a thousand dollars in like ’89, ’90, something like that, and he gave me a million dollars, it was like, “Yo, go to the studio and do some you know, do some music.” That was like my entrée into it, and it just made it serious. Back then everything was demo, demo, demo. It’s not like how right now, a thousand dollars, you can go make an album and put it on the internet, there was no internet back then, you know what I mean? I had to go to the studio, you know, get somebody to make a beat for me, it was a process, I had to pay for studio time, which was whatever, $100 an hour and all that, you know, and that’s what the start was, and you know, I was just like, yo, after that I made connections, because then you become legit, like I got a real demo, like it doesn’t have to be good, but it’s like, “Oh, he’s serious about this,” so, now I make connections with other people that’s rapping and, “Oh yeah, you come to the studio for free now.” Jeff Mao I guess eventually, at some point, one of the folks that you connected with later was Mr. Voodoo, was that right? Ka Yeah, Mr. Voodoo. I’m sure they don’t know who that is, but it was a crew in New York was called Natural Elements and they were like an underground group. They were getting a lot of acclaim and the head dude, the more famous of them, Mr. Voodoo, we went to school together. We went to city college together. Back then, as probably now, the loudest ones are the ones that don’t do it so well. I was doing it pretty loud, everybody knew I’m rhyming. I’m rhyming for everybody. He must have saw something, he was like, “Yo, come to the studio.” I got into this group called Natural Elements. Charlemagne was the producer, he produced for all of us. It was L-Swift, Big Tim, Stex, G-Blass. It was a bunch of us and we would go to the Bronx every Saturday and be in the studio. He’d be making beats for all of us. “That’s for you, this is for you.” We’d battle him for this beat and all that. That helped me to know how to structure a song. Back then, I was just writing rhymes. I had pages and pages and books and I had a duffle bag of just raps on receipts and the back of transfers on buses. I was rapping just to rap. They did let me know, “OK, this is how you make a song. You break that up and this is a bar right here, this is a hook, and this is that.” With that, they helped me become a better artist. It was a progression to start making songs. Jeff Mao Do you think you were nice back then? Ka I was dead garbage back then. I was trash back then. I knew I wanted to do it and I knew I had something to say. It takes time to find your voice. Some kids are prodigies, they just they got it immediately. I was not a prodigy, it took me time to find my voice. I got help, Natural Elements was one of the stages to get me to another plateau. The next plateau was I did another group with my boy, god rest his soul, one of my best friends Kev. We were in a group called Nightbreed. This was in the later ’90s and he was stellar. Step me up to be better. That was another plateau for me to reach, doing songs with him. I’m listening to the song, his parts are incredible, my part’s kind of corny, like... this was my man, he loved me. This was like, we did songs and eventually I got up to snuff and that was another plateau. Jeff Mao You don’t... you glossed over some of this stuff, you really don’t want me to play any of this early stuff of yours? You always say you hate it… Ka I got... people clap for me, please don’t make them boo for me now, man. Come on, man. Jeff Mao I’m not going to make them boo, but let’s just give a little context, alright? This is a track actually, Natural Elements featuring Ka. Let’s switch it up a little bit... Ka Do your thing. Jeff Mao I’m not going to play the one... Maybe you don’t hate this one as much, it’s called "Triple Team." (music: Natural Elements ft. Ka – “Triple Team” / applause) Ka Thank you, thank you. You heard three voices. The two good voices you heard was Mr. Voodoo and L-Swift. The more gravely voice was K A, that’s who I was before Ka. That was me. Jeff Mao You decided to step away from this group. Why? Ka Because I was bad. I felt like I was holding it back. I was like, “Yo, these kids are dope.” There was a time where again, I don’t ever want to hold nobody back. I’m like, “They could skyrocket if it wasn’t for me”, I knew I was bringing them down. But they were doing me a solid by putting me in the group, so I felt like I needed to do them a solid and be like, “Boom, go do your thing”. I stepped away, and they filled that spot with a dude called A-Butta, who was very, he was in pocket with them immediately and they made some great music together. As soon as I left, boom, they got signed by Tommy Boy. Great. I was happy for them. Then I went to go do the music with my boy from down the block, which was my man Kev. Jeff Mao How does Nightbreed sound to you now? Ka It depends on what song you play. But I love Nightbreed, because that was more, that was my boy. We were in each other’s houses writing, and talking about real experiences that we were doing at the time. I’ll forever love Nightbreed, that’s one of my best friends. Jeff Mao Let’s hear a little bit of Nightbreed. “Two Roads Out The Ghetto”. (music: Nightbreed – “Two Roads Out The Ghetto” / applause) Ka That was hard, that was a hard one right there. That was my best friend, and he just died recently, so it’s just tough to hear his voice. Jeff Mao I think in addition to the camaraderie you can hear with you guys, you are already forecasting how you want to approach this music. Even in these things, which I know you hear sometimes. Ka Well, I wanted to talk about real shit. Jeff Mao Yeah. Ka I wanted to talk about real, not just, “My raps, my raps.” I wanted to talk about what was going on. Jeff Mao At the same time, you’ve stepped away again. I think this is an important part of your story. The different instances in which you decided, obviously incorrectly, that you’re not good enough to do this, and you took a break, or you stepped away. What happened here? Ka After that, we thought we were good. We thought we were going to do it. I started hearing that we sounded better. I wasn’t mad at that one, that was the first time I started, “Oh, I ain’t that bad.” But we were doing songs, and doing songs, and had singles and all that. But this is the time when everybody was rapping. Everybody halfway sounded decent in New York. Doing the lyricist lounges, and doing all that. We didn’t get a record deal, we didn’t get a deal. That’s what it was. You shop your demo, and then you get a record deal, and then it’s on. Then you can do what you do. We didn’t get one. But we kept grinding, kept grinding, kept grinding. Then it just got to a point where it was like, “Are we too... Are we bugging? Should we be... We’ve got families, man. Let’s go get some money.” My boy, as you heard in the song, he had a daughter at the time. I was like, “Should we be taking this childhood dream bullshit of being rappers, and say fuck it, and just go get some jobs? Just be men.” Because that’s what it was. You could be a dreamer for a little while, but then you’ve got to start being like, “Alright, this ain’t us.” At the time, that’s what I was thinking. That’s what happened. We just quit. “This ain’t happening for us, let’s just go get money.” Jeff Mao But what happened? You came back to it. Ka Yeah, that’s the thing. It was a passion. I didn’t know what a passion was until this hip-hop shit. It wouldn’t let me go, I couldn’t stop. I think about rhymes all the time. When I’m talking to somebody, and they say something, I’m hearing the rhyme that would go perfectly with that. Or I’m listening to other people’s songs, and I’m like, “He rhymed that wrong. He should have rhymed this. That shit would have hit right.” I couldn’t stay away from the shit. It was like, I’m trying to. I threw books away, I threw all my notebooks away. I was like, “I’m not doing this shit no more. Fuck this shit, it ruined my life.” But I couldn’t stop, so I came back with the help of people that loved me, and were like, “You’re good. Just do it.” That’s how I got back. Jeff Mao What did you do? What did you work on? Ka I worked on an album that nobody has ever heard. But I started getting back into it. Like, “You know what? It was always group, group, group. This time, it’s just going to be Ka. I’m just going to do an album, just for me.” I worked on a couple albums to just get me right, to the point that then I did Iron Works. But Iron Works was the album that I did that wasn’t supposed to go to anyone except the people I love. For all these years, I’m telling you all, “I’m going to the studio, I’m going to the studio.” You say that studio shit for enough years, people are like, “The fuck are you doing? I haven’t heard from you. How come I’m not hearing you on the radio? You’re talking this studio shit like you must...” This was for all the people I was telling, “I’m going to the studio.” I wanted to give them a CD like, “Boom, thanks for being my friend all these years”. So I did that first album. Which, I don’t even know the date. 2007 maybe? I don’t know. Jeff Mao 2008. Ka 2008, I think that’s when I might have... I think people just gravitated to it, 2008. But I think I actually had it in people’s hands, I gave it to my cousins and I gave it to my friends in 2007. It was an album that, the first free material that I did. Not free as far as money wise, free as far as, “I don’t care.” I didn’t give a fuck what nobody thought. “This is my shit right here, I’m giving it to you. Love it or hate it, but this is me. This is my contribution to hip-hop.” All these years since I was eight years old, I wanted to be a rapper. I had nothing to show for it. I’m like, “This is crazy, let me do an album.” Then technology was around to the point that I could do an album. And it wasn’t an album/demo to, “Let’s go do an album, but I want the majors to hear it so I can get a record deal.” No, it was, “I’m doing an album, give it to you. As soon as I give it to you, you can use it as a frisbee, or you can bump it.” It didn’t matter to me. It was great to just finally do music like that. It was like a breakthrough for me, boom, I’m doing it, like I’m an artist. Jeff Mao And it got into somebody’s hands. Ka Yeah. My wife has a friend that knew a friend, and then another friend’s cousin... Anyway, it got to the hands of GZA from Wu, from the Wu-Tang, which I respect and is, to me, one of the best lyricists ever in the craft. He sat and heard it, listened to it. Which is weird because I know he gets CD all the time. The fact that he listened to it was a salute. He didn’t just listen to it, he heard it and was like, “Yo, Duke is nice,” and he wanted to do a song with me, which I thought was just industry bullshit talk like, “yeah, I’ll do a song with him.” I get a call when I’m at work one day from GZA saying, “I’m in the studio now, I want to do a joint with you.” I’m like, “Word? Alright.” I left work and headed to the studio. I’m thinking there’s going to be a bunch of dudes in there because I never met him before. I’m thinking there’s going to be a posse cut, like there’s going to be eight of us rhyming, I’m going to say about four lines and then I’m over. I get in there and it’s just him in the studio. He’s like, “Yo, I’ve been listening to what you got and I think I got a beat for you that I think you’ll rock on.” I’m excited. I’m going to the studio, I’m going to the booth and I spit the first verse. I’m done. I’m excited. I’m like, “Oh yeah.” Then he looks in the booth and was like, “You got more?” And I was like, “I got 20 years more. What you need?” (laughs) He let me just go and do my thing on the whole song. We did the hook and he put it on his album. I had a song on GZA’s album. It was kind of like validation to me. Jeff Mao How do you feel about that song? Ka “Firehouse,” it’s fire. Jeff Mao All right, good. Let’s listen to a little bit of “Firehouse” by GZA featuring Ka. (music: GZA ft. Ka – “Firehouse” / applause) Ka Thank you, thank you. Jeff Mao Now, for people who know your music or are familiar with your music, these older songs are an anomaly in a way. You sound different. Your delivery is different. Obviously the attention to what you’re writing is there. The first song we played, “Conflicted,” represents where you are. Ka Right now, yeah yeah yeah. Jeff Mao And where you have been, to some degree, it’s evolved as well. When did you decide, “OK, I’m not projecting my voice that way anymore, I’m going to use my voice a different way?” When did you decide that? Ka With maturity. I’m in my 40s so as you get older... You ever hear an old man like, “Yo, keep that noise down. Keep that noise down,” I’m that old man now. Keep that noise down. Even for me. I don’t want to hear no yelling like, “Easy.” I don’t want to hear it. You’ll get there one day. You’ll understand me. I couldn’t continue to be yelling. My youthful angst rap days are over. I did that already, it was cool. I’m becoming something else. I’m in my mature rap stage. Very introspective. I don’t need to yell. It’s like I’m dreaming. My dreams aren’t yelling. That just made me bring it down. I think I was yelling back in the days because I always wanted people like, “You heard what I said? Did you hear that? Did you hear that bar? That bar was crazy. He went with that line.” Now I’m like, “You catch it at your leisure.” I don’t want you to catch everything on the first listen. I want you to be listening to it years from now and be like, “Oh, that was crazy.” The fact that I didn’t yell made it more profound, I feel. That’s just my perspective. I had to turn it down a notch. I’m just speaking. I wanted to be... This ain’t jams. I’m not making jams. It’s not radio songs. These are very personal songs. When you have it in your headphone when you’re on the train or you’re just going through something, you put this on if you decide to put me on. Now I’m in that room with you, chilling. I’m talking with you. I’m building with you. That’s what it was. If you ever heard the term building, two people talking and exchanging ideas. We call it building. It’s like that’s what I’m doing. I’m building with you in these songs. I had to turn it down. Jeff Mao You also began producing yourself. Ka (applause) Thank you, thank you. I appreciate it. Salute to whoever started that. That was fire. (laughs) Jeff Mao Right over there. You started producing your own beats as well. Coming into it relatively late in the game. How did that benefit you, you think? Because some of the things that we’ve discussed this week at the Academy have related to that. How you can not know the right way to do things or the traditional way to do things and in a way that’s giving you a fresher perspective. Is that how you felt? Ka Oh, definitely. I came into this as an eight year old wanting to be the illest MC ever. After times, I just wanted to write rhymes. That’s all I wanted to do. It takes more than just writing rhymes to be an MC nowadays in 2016 and forever on. I couldn’t just write rhymes and think that I’m going to be heard. After chasing people for beats and then getting into the beat game like, “Yo, that beat is...” You go to a producer and they’ve got a beat that’s really, really good. They’re not giving it to me. They’re going to give it to the person that they’re going to make that be heard. I cannot even fault them on that. If me and Kanye are in the same room and this producer got a beat and me and Kanye say, “I like that,” who do you think he’s giving that beat to? Kanye is going to make it where the world is going to hear it. That producer is now going to, in turn, get more work. I understand. I’m not in that game, though. I’m not trying to play your beat games. I’m going to make my own so that now Kanye won’t hear my beat. I won’t have to be battling with him for my beat. I make my own beats then I rhyme to my own beats. If I make something that’s dope, I’m the only one sitting on it knowing that I made something that’s dope. It just got to that point that I just didn’t want to... I wanted to be more self reliant. That where that came from. Jeff Mao How do you decide what works best for your voice, for your delivery, and for your subject matter? Ka Well, there’s a certain aesthetic I’m looking for. I like dark. I’ve always written from dark places. It was me escaping darkness that made me write. I’m looking for tones that can just complement what I’m doing. My voice is kind of lower, sometimes it’s raspy, this that and the third. I’m not trying to yell over beats. I’ve said it before, a beat’s not done until I’m the last instrument on it. I want to be the one that just complements the beat. I cannot even tell you what I’m looking for just like all the artists in the room right now. You don’t know what you look for. You just know when you have it. When I know I have it, that’s when all of a sudden I shut down and I become the MC that I want to become. Jeff Mao Let’s listen to something from the album Grief Pedigree. This track is entitled “Vessel.” (music: Ka – “Vessel” / applause) Ka Dope, dope, dope. Thank you, thank you. I like that joint, that’s one of my favorites. That wrote itself, really, basically. Jeff Mao Why is that one of your favorites? Ka The points that I was touching; I remember writing that one, being very happy with that when I was in my room writing that one. Just something about it, I feel that one. It’s one of the ones I like performing. I’m into that one heavy. Jeff Mao “This might be god that’s speaking, it’s just my mouth moving.” Ka Yeah. I’m not under the guise like, “Yo, it’s me, I’m so dope!” I know some of these lines that I get and some of the stuff that I come, it’s like, this came from somewhere else. Like I said, it might be god speaking, it’s just my mouth is moving, so I’m not… It’s not, “Me, me, me, I’m dope, I’m so talented.” I’m not that dude, so a lot of the stuff, I’m sure, is gifts. I wake up with rhyme sometimes. That ain’t me. Wherever it came from, whatever your supreme being you believe it is, it came from somewhere, so that’s why I said that. (applause) Thank you, man, thank you. Too kind, too kind. Can I take y’all with me to my shows? Jeff Mao You don’t do shows, though. Ka I don’t do shows. You’re right. Forget it! You’re right, I don’t do shows. Jeff Mao I’m curious to know, though, why don’t you do shows? Is it because you have some sort of shyness as far as performing or is this what you feel is the best mode of presentation? Ka It’s a lot of reasons why I don’t do shows. One is, I don’t know if this is show music. That’s one. That’s just me, this is personal music. For now. I know some people want to see me perform, and I’m going to go out there and do this for the people, but for now, it’s like, I just don’t know if this is that kind of… If you’re not into me, then you won’t understand what I’m saying, but if anybody in here listens to my music, I know this is something that’s very personal, because it’s personal for me, so if you’re into my sound, then it’s like, do you see yourself in a party like that, listening to my stuff? I did a couple shows, right, I had a nice show in… I did the Pitchfork Festival a couple years back, and it was great, the people were great, but they were all looking at me like this [crossed arms pose]. Not that they weren’t happy, because after the song was over, then they clapped and all that, but it just felt weird to me, like, “Did I just drag these people out here to be all somber? They could have did that shit in they house!” I’m bringing you out here to actually, maybe make you cry. I don’t want to do that. Jeff Mao You mention duality in your writing, which is this recurring thing throughout. I think one interesting way that manifests itself in what you do is just the wordplay. Using the same word, phonetically sounding the same, but it’s two different words. Is that something you can kind of… I know this might be very specific, but is it something you can kind of break down? This writing thing is your passion, and is there a way for you to sort of explain that component of it to those of us who don’t write rhymes, and how tricky that is to do? Ka To be a MC, or to be a lyricist… There’s a lot of MCs, but to be a lyricist, it’s about… You ever heard the term, “Yo, he got bars, he got bars?” You might have heard that. “He got bars, he got bars.” What that means is that he says something very, very slick and very profound in that one or two lines that was like, crazy. I want that. Growing up listening to hip-hop, I heard a lot of slick lines and was like, “Wow, how’d he come up with that?” I wanted to be that dude for the listeners now, like, “Yo, that shit was incredible, how’d he come up with that?” Or “Yo, that was so deep, it meant… It had… There’s a triple entendre!” That’s what everybody’s looking for. Or the quadruple entendre or whatever. That’s what I… I’m trying to do that, you know? In the rhymes, in the wordplay of it, I’m trying to think of something to be so slick, but still be relevant to what I’m saying. I’m not trying to say… It’s a lot of MCs that, they just rhyming to rhyme. They rapping to give you those double, triple entendres, in just a song. Just rhymes. I’m trying to do it in the context of what I do. That’s what I’m trying to do. I don’t know if I explained that right. Jeff Mao Do you have any specific examples of line wordplay like that, how that would work? Ka I’d rather them… They’ll just find it. I like people to… I don’t want to tell… That’s the one thing, I don’t want to annotate my rhymes, because you might hear something that is incredible to you, and I don’t want to fuck that up by saying, “I really said this.” The thing I always say all the time is like, when you’re looking at a painting, or a sculpture, I don’t have Leonardo Da Vinci telling me, “Well, this is what I was trying to do.” I just want to look at and get from what I want, like, “Yo, this shit is beautiful,” and whatever the feelings and what I come up… What I think of it as when I’m looking at it, that’s what I want y’all to have, so when you listening to me, I don’t want to be in the back of your head like, “Nah, you know I said this right here.” And, “Yo, you know, listen, we were coming right now, this is crazy, this, this, this,” like, nah, I want you to just appreciate it. Love it, hate it, whatever, how it is, but I want it to fall to you as it falls to you. So if I tell you a line right now, I’m going to fuck up a song for them. You know what I’m saying? “Oh, but yo,” so I don’t want them to... Jeff Mao But that’s... that makes sense though. Because it is a discovery process with listening to new music, because it requires... Ka It requires listening. Listen, I’m asking a lot of my listeners, and I thank them, but I’m asking you to sit down, cut the lights off, and just listen. Like, yo, cut your phone off, cut the lights off, tell nobody don’t mess with you for the next half an hour, and just listen. So that’s a lot, especially in this instant gratification time, so it’s kind of hard. So I’m asking people to do something that they really don’t have... They’re not used to doing right now. What I used to do, me and Jeff, we’re dating ourselves, we used to have headphones, be on the train with a CD, well not a CD, with a tape, and that tape would just go and go and go while you’re on your ride to your train. I’m not fast-forwarding that tape because it makes the... Fast-forwarding, reversing, drains the batteries. So we know that, so you’re listening to songs that you might not listen to, and that song that you hated, by the time you went from Rockaway Avenue to 42nd Street, that song wasn’t that bad. And then you’re listening to it again and again and you’re hearing things that the person said, as opposed to now, where you get 30 seconds, if you’re going to buy that song. “Am I going to buy that song? 30 seconds, I don’t like that song. OK, I like that song. Oh no, I don’t like that song.” We had to listen to whole albums and whole songs to ascertain whether we liked it or not, and it was more of a complete thing. I think I’m going off on a tangent, so I’m going to chill. Jeff Mao I’d like to play video number two, if we could, just to sort of also shed some light on this self-sufficiency of yours, in addition to making the music, producing the music, rhyming, you distribute the music, you direct the videos, so it’s a very DIY operation. Ka Yeah, you’re making me sound like I’m somebody, man. Well, I had to. I had to do that. Of course I’m going to write the rhymes, then I had to make the beats, so I’d have to actually produce these funny beats. Then I’m looking, I’m sitting at home with my wife, and we’re like, “Alright, we did an album, how do we make people listen to this now?” So, like, “Yo, let’s make a video!” So I’m calling people... Well, it wasn’t, “Let’s make a video,” it was, “Let’s get a video done.” I’m calling people, like, “Yo, can you do a video? 30 grand? 30 thousand for a video? B, I’m not a rich man.” So now I’m like, “Can we shoot a video?” So, you know, my wife is amazing, B. So she bought a camera, she went out in the middle of the night in these hoods, you know what I’m saying? Like, shooting videos with me, and we took it home, edited it, and we looked at each other like, “Is this good? I guess it’s good. Let’s just put it on YouTube.” And then a couple people started checking it out, and then, you know, things happened. Jeff Mao This is actually from The Night’s Gambit. Track is entitled, “Peace Akhi”, and the music video by Ka. So let’s check it out. (video: Ka – “Peace Akhi” / applause) Ka Thank you, thank you. Jeff Mao If the music, as you prefer people to listen to it, is without any distraction, I mean, is it counter-intuitive in a way to produce a visual accompaniment to it? Ka Well, I was for... You’re right. But that was so that people could know who the hell I am. I still would like more people to acknowledge the music than to... I want people that needed to find it. So if I didn’t do any visuals for it, then it’s probably, a lot of people that won’t find it. I’m one of those artists that you discover, you know, haphazardly, you’re going through YouTube, like, “Oh, who’s this? Boom, OK.” But I’m doing videos so that people can find out about me. So I’ve got 20-something videos now, maybe one of them might be linked to one of your favorite videos, and you stumble upon it, and you know, you like it or not. So that’s what it’s for. Jeff Mao I think the line that always stands out to me in this is, “Pain in spoken form.” Ka Yes. That’s what I feel like I’m doing. I’m probably depressed, probably, who knows, I haven’t sat with anybody, but if you listen to the music, you’ll be like, “Yeah, this dude is depressed.” But that’s what I’m doing. I feel like I’m pain in the spoken form, like that’s what I’m giving you. I’ve got five albums of pain, you know what I mean? In the spoken form. So that’s, I feel like, this is definitely, that’s my lane, that’s my pocket. If you coming to me for party songs, don’t come to me. I’m going to tell you that right now, if you’re like, “I love my music very exciting,” I’m not your dude, alright? I’m not him. You just lost your favorite uncle and you’re about to start... you just want to know, can somebody get through this pain? Yes. You listen to me, and I’ve been through that, and we’ll get through it together. That’s what I feel like I am. Jeff Mao I mean, you’ve done a lot of this on your own. You have started to sort of widen your circle a little bit in terms of collaboration. Everybody in this room is collaborating just with people they’ve never met before. Ka Which is dope. Jeff Mao How do you... How are you able to build the trust of who you work with? Ka I only do music... My music is super personal. I only do music with people I consider friends. That’s just a decision that I made. I’ve become really close friends with Roc Marciano, if anybody knows my music, I’m sure they know his. A really good brother, he helped me out a lot. I also did an album with a friend of mine now. His name is DJ Preservation, I call him Prez. We did an album together, where he did all of the music and I was rhyming. We called ourselves Dr. Yen Lo, the name of the album was Days with Dr. Yen Lo. That’s how I feel. I can’t do songs with the... “Yo, email me this song, email me the beat.” I can’t do that. I have to be able to communicate and be friends with a person. That’s just what I want to do, I know music is forever, I know the power of music and I know it’s forever and I want to... I need to know if your energy is right. Sounds weird but it’s just me. I can’t do a song with a person I never met just because they send me an email, but that’s me. I’m from, I’m an older person. I know that young kids are like, “What? You don’t do email songs?” Yeah that’s me, I got to get with the person, we go to studio together, we do an album, we do the songs. That’s how I work. Jeff Mao I remember once you told me back then, back in the day, you didn’t want to be the 30-year-old rapper, that was like a terrible thing. Ka Yeah I didn’t want to, what it was… It was just like hip-hop is, we know hip-hop is, it’s ageist. It’s a youth sound, it’s a young… While I was young and rhyming and rhyming, I didn’t think about it until I didn’t get on, and now I’m 30 years old rapping, and it was associates would be like, “You still rhyming?” I’m ashamed to say, “Yeah.” Like, “No, I don’t rhyme no more,” like, lying and shit, but I had to come to grips with... “Hold on man.” In other genres, in blues, you ain’t official until you 50. You know what I mean? (laughs) You can’t tell me no pain is no 12 year old. Maybe you can, but unless you an older man. I’m like, I shouldn’t let my age scare me to do something that I just love doing. What I want, for you guys, is a quick little something like, are you prepared to do what you’re doing when it ain’t cool no more? That’s a passion. What I’m doing necessarily ain’t cool no more, right? Writing rhymes and shit as a 40-year-old man. That ain’t cool for some, it’s cool for me, I’m good with it, you know what I’m saying? Don’t get it fucked up. Whatever the hot genre is right now and everybody’s doing it, are you going to be prepared to do that when it ain’t cool no more? When you’re like a weirdo doing... It might be somebody right now in they house, a 60-year-old man that’s still doing disco. That shit ain’t cool no more, but he love that shit. I got to salute that man for that. You know what I mean? I’m the 40 year old still fucking rapping. It took me a long time, and support from people that love me, that says, “Yo, man, you good. Who cares how old you are.” I didn’t want to be the 30-year-old rapper, because that’s like a cliché diss. If I’m the 40-year-old, 30- or 40- or 50- or 60-year-old rapper that’s still got bars, as we know what bars are now, then what can you say to me? If I’m still doing what I love, then what can you say? (applause) Thank you. Jeff Mao You also, at a certain point... I think one of the important things for us to mention, is you mention you have a job, you have been doing music this entire time, but you’re realistic enough to decide, “Hey, I got to just go out there and have a regular life.” Ka Yeah, I had to work. My job is... It made me be the artist that I could be. I never had to compromise myself because I know, I’m able to eat from my job. I go to work, I have a job, I can eat, I can pay my mortgage. I can eat. I didn’t have to like, “Wait, I know my music is kind of...” What I love to do with music, doesn’t really appeal to the masses. "Let me go and do a jam that’s more sounding like the sound of the times so that I can be popular and go on tour, and make that money." I didn’t need that. I’m good. All I care about is that, “Can I eat and do I have a house?” Can I live? Me having a job just let me be the artist I can be, free. I can do what I want. I do what I want to do, artistically, with no one telling me a thing. I’m the record label owner, and I’m the artist. I’m the only artist. I let my artist do what the hell he want to do, and I just pay for it, as the president of that label. If you want me as your label president, nahmean. You want yourself as your label president. Listen, as artists we are, we all are artists over business. That’s how we get manipulated most of the time, because it’s like, “I just want to do my art.” I don’t want to read those papers, those contracts. If you’re your own boss, you won’t jerk yourself, and you’ll let your artist run wild with your own money. I know some of you probably are like, “I’m an artist, I’m not working, I’m not getting a job.” Just know, that you’re speaking to an artist that has a job and it let me be a better artist because I’m not compromising in any way. Just something to think about, in your future. Jeff Mao Do you want to talk any specifics about your job? Ka I mean, you want to ask me, ask me. Ask me. Jeff Mao What do you do, what do you do for a living? Ka I’m a fireman. I’m a New York City firefighter. (applause) Thank you, thank you. I’ve been doing it for 17 years. It’s a dangerous job as we all know, but it’s a beautiful job. I wanted to pay back some of the dirt that I used to do, when I was... Back when I was younger. I was like, “What’s a noble profession?” I was like, teacher, I don’t think I have the patience with the kids, or I could be a firefighter, and firefighter appealed to me more. That’s what I do. That’s probably why some songs I’m a little different, the gravellier the voice, sometime, you know? That smoke inhalation’s a motherfucker, but yeah. That’s me. You know, that’s what I do. Jeff Mao Are you able to... I’ve always been curious about this, you self-release these albums, they usually drop in the summer, so does that mean you were good… but the music's so dark. I always associate it with the winter. Where and when do you record, when do you find time between working and... Ka I make time. I’m pretty nocturnal, I don’t get a lot of sleep. In the night, I’m doing a lot of my writing at night. I like to record when it’s colder. I go to the studios when it’s coldest. That New York feel, that grittiness that I’m, you know, when I used to be cold in my house. When I’m writing, I’m still on Ho’ Street. Everything I’ve ever written, in my head, I’m still on that top floor Ho’ Street, with the leaky roof, sleeping in my Mighty Mac coat, hungry. That’s where I’m writing from. That’s why you get that cold feeling, because while I’m writing, I’m cold, and I’m starving. That’s when I like to write best. Jeff Mao Want to listen to one more thing. This is, you mentioned the Dr. Yen Lo project with Preservation. Let’s listen to “Day 13.” (music: Dr. Yen Lo – “Day 13” / applause) Jeff Mao Do you think we put too much emphasis on this idea of authenticity? Or, what does it mean to you? Ka To be authentic? Authenticity? Jeff Mao In hip-hop I mean. Ka You mean, like, living what you speak, type authenticity? Jeff Mao However you want to define it. Ka I think it is something in hip-hop that’s real. Like, “Is he real? Or is he fronting?” In hip-hop, you know, it used to be like, yo, you couldn’t speak what you didn’t live. That’s the time I’m from. If you saying something, you kind of had to live it. I don’t know if that’s the case anymore. The rules that set me to be an MC, are the rules that I’ve had from the ’80s, you know ’70s and ’80s. I’m not steering from those rules. Authenticity for me is, yeah, major. Major. We know, in other genres of music, it’s not really the case. You could be an R&B singer singing about, “I love women, I love women,” and be homosexual. That don’t really, it don’t matter, as long as the song is beautiful it don’t really matter. In hip-hop I think it’s a different thing. Like, yo, they want to know your background too. Like, “Is he live? If he ain’t live, then he shouldn’t be talking about that.” I think, I don’t know. I might be stuck on that. I think you need to be genuine, to me. But I’m OG, you know? (laughs) Jeff Mao Or at least honest about what you want to do, you know? Ka Exactly. I know I would like, if I’m listening to a new artist that I really, really like, and he’s talking ‘hood shit, and then I come to find out he’s born in some real posh neighborhood, I would be upset. You know? I still might bump the music, who knows? It’s about me, music is about feeling too. I need to feel a person to really get into them, as well. If I know what you’re saying is genuine, and you’re also true to that then I get into you more. You ever like, have an artist that you like, and then you see the interview? And you’re like, “Damn, I like them even more now!” Because you learned something else about the artist. That’s part of being real. Like, that person’s a nice dude. Make you root for them even more. I think it’s the genuineness of it. You know. Jeff Mao Are you glad you came here today? Ka Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jeff Mao Because you didn’t want to. (laughs) Ka You going blow me up? I wanted to come! You know this… I was like, “Why you want to talk to me, man? These kids don’t know who I am!” You know what I’m saying? You know, my man, they asked me to come, I said no. Not that I didn’t want to be around you good people. I just didn’t want to waste you good people’s time. That’s what it was, you know what I’m saying? Jeff hit me, was like, called me on the phone was like, “Yo. I need you to come to this thing, man. You know what I’m saying? You coming or what? I need you here!” I was like, “Alright, if you call me direct, then yes I’ll come.” I’m very happy that I came to this. This was a great experience. All the clapping, I feel like, you know. (applause) Montréal… It’s my first time. This is my first time in Canada. I got to see Canada. It was beautiful. I would have never... Nobody called me for shows up here. It was good to see, man. It was great. I wish all y’all success in whatever endeavors y’all do musically. I hope to see some of y’all and be like, “I spoke to that person when they was... In 2016. Y’all big and stars now. I spoke to them in 2016.” Jeff Mao Before we take some questions, I think we should say thank you, once again, to Ka. (applause) Ka Thank you, thank you! Too kind, too kind. Thank you, thank you. Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill. Thank you, thank you. Jeff Mao Anybody have a question? Do we have any mics? Participants, please, participants. Audience Member Hi. Ka What’s good man? Audience Member First off, I just want to say thank you very much. Ka Thank you! Audience Member It was super insightful and relative, like your approach to music. A handful of your tracks are quite minimal, and loop based. Which I’ve seen quite a bit with Roc Marciano, Alchemist, Durag Dynasty and that sort of stuff. Do you feel like those songs are different to songs with drums in them, and do you feel like they’re more so, not necessarily songs, but more so, like platforms or soundtracks for you to express yourself or tell a story? Ka Oh, yeah, definitely. What’s your name, brother? Audience Member Luke. Ka Luke? Nice to meet you, Luke. Audience Member Nice to meet you too. Ka Great question, man. The artist that he said, Rock Marci, which is my boy, Alchemist, another dude that, every now and then we kick it on the phone. They call it minimalist sound in hip-hop, where the drums aren’t really driving. Traditionally in hip-hop the drums, “boom, boom, ba,” like, they even actually call it boom bap. You know what I’m saying? We had stayed away from it. It was before us. There’s some songs, that back in the days, that they stayed away from the drums… Audience Member Yeah. Like some of Wu-Tang… Ka Yeah. Exactly. RZA was big with that, you know what I’m saying? I wish I could remember one of the Ghost songs that I really liked that was like… Audience Member “I Can’t Go To Sleep”? Audience Member “All That I Got Is You”? Audience Member “Box In Hand”? Ka There you go. You know what I’m saying? Then there you go. We just kind of like, like let’s laze it out. I felt like I was fighting drums, a lot. On my tracks. I’m like, if I strip the drums down, I don’t have to be so loud on the track. It actually brings you closer to me, because without the drums the percussion of my voice… Audience Member Rhythm? Ka Yeah, it just makes you like, you got to listen to me. You got to listen to Roc Marci. You got to listen to all the other artists that are doing this. It brings you closer to the words. It brings you closer to the feeling. I like it like that. If I’m a minimalist, then yes, I’m proud to be that. Audience Member Cool. Thank you. Ka Thank you. Great question. Cousin up there with the hat, the Yankee hat. I’ll get you, you wanted a question too, right? No? OK. Audience Member Alright, oh shit! There you go. First off my mom is from Brownsville, so it’s really dope to see somebody else from Brownsville. Ka What’s your name cousin, what’s your name? Audience Member Steve. Ka What block she from? Audience Member She’s from Mother Gaston. Ka Yeah. Mother Gaston. That’s what’s up. Audience Member She used to live over there from like the ’60s to the ’70s. Ka You know the original name for Mother Gatson was Stone Ave. Audience Member I didn’t know that. Ka Yeah. Stone Ave. Your mom’s from Stone Ave. Audience Member Because my grandpa, even back in the day when the “Rock the Boat” song came out, my grandpa used to be a pimping mother in Brownsville, and then he got stabbed up, and my mom associates that song now… Because when she heard that song for the first time, my grandpa was knocking on the door when the dudes were stabbing him up. His lungs were bleeding black shit. The stories you’re telling about Brownsville is so accurate. I don’t think a lot of people understand how real it is, and it’s still like that, to this day. They tried to throw a Banksy piece over there and people were trying to charge people money to even see it. Ka Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Audience Member That shit was real. That’s why I love Brownsville. Ka Hey listen, you come over here with this art, they’re like, “Can we eat?” All we thinking about is how can we eat? Audience Member Exactly. Ka How can I get money from this? Yeah, it was real. I don’t want to ask how old your moms is, but I’m sure… Audience Member She’s 55. Ka She’s 55? She a little older than me, but she from the same time, so she know it was real, and you’re from the ‘ville by descent, then I salute you cousin. Audience Member I’m from East Flatbush too, that’s what’s up. Ka That’s what’s up. That’s what’s up. Audience Member My question was, who is the artist that you were listening to growing up that influenced your music and who do you listen to now that influences your music? Ka Growing up, it was… son asked me before too. I loved hip-hop until, I wanted to do hip-hop when I heard Slick Rick. Slick was like, incredible, man. You know what I’m saying? I still think the best storyteller to ever do it in this craft, but KRS-One. Rakim. All the old cats, Treacherous Three, Moe Dee, LL, Run DMC, all that. Growing up, I listened to everybody, growing up. That’s just what it was. I was listening to Mr. Magic, Marley Marl and Red Alert and they played everything, you know what I mean? Now, it’s not just hip-hop. Hip-hop that I need, is not really being made like that. I got used to, let’s say you get used to you know, a hamburger, for lack of a better term. They making deconstructed hamburgers now. Which, that’s gauche, that’s that chef shit. That’s that fly shit. They doing that. I want a hamburger though. They’re not really making them. It’s hard for me to find that hamburger. Now, I got to go, let me go get some meatloaf over here, and let me go get some... I’m listening to a lot more R&B now.

John Tejada
Known for crafting a brand of subtle musical techno, John Tejada has proven to the world over the years that regardless of tempo or style he always retains the quality he has become renowned for. Be it his productions on his own Palette label, his drum & bass excursions with London-based producer Klute, collaborations with Arian Leviste or Titonton Duvante, or even his post-rock electronica experiments as I’m Not A Gun, Tejada is an example of extreme creative talent which shows no genre boundaries.
Hosted by Fergus Murphy It’s my pleasure to welcome John, with a silent J, Tejada. Having clarified and having heard about ten different pronunciations of the name, it’s a pleasure to know how to say it correctly. John Tejada Alright. Fergus Murphy You can of course also say it with a Spanish accent but I’m not going to try that here and now. The other thing, John, over the last week or so with your name coming up and the obvious mispronunciations, I also found quite a lot of people would describe your music in very different names. The word techno came up, the word house came up, I heard some people mention jazzy, broken, all these things. Is there a preferred title for you or... John Tejada I don’t know, I mean to me it’s almost like a BPM issue. You know, if it’s a bit faster it’s techno, if it’s a bit slower, it’s house. If I throw other rhythms in, all of the sudden it’s broken beat but to me it’s sort of the same thing, even like short phase of drum & bass, I just tell people to me, it’s 45 BPM faster and people don’t like that answer like no, you know hip-hop it’s 30 bpm slower, not hip-hop but you my sort of slower thing... Fergus Murphy Downbeat... John Tejada Downbeat and things. I kind of grew up with my parents being classical musicians and just sort of hearing a broad scale of all kinds of music when I was young, so in a way in my head it’s just music in a way, you know, I mean all these things get categorized to death, like house has, tech-house and deep house and about 30 other things and you play it for your mom and it’s like, “Oh yeah okay, it’s all the same really.” Fergus Murphy What BPM is your house cut off? John Tejada Well that’s the whole thing, I don’t see it that way... Fergus Murphy No, no okay. John Tejada But yeah, I don’t know. Fergus Murphy You spent some time as a kid in Vienna, you mentioned just now that your parents are classical musicians... John Tejada Right. Fergus Murphy Why, why Vienna? John Tejada That’s where I was born. Fergus Murphy That’s where you were born yeah and what instruments do they play? John Tejada They started me off on piano when I was... My dad really, he was really into this, he’s going to do everything, so I think around age three or four I had learned piano stuff and then when I moved with my mom to the states, my cousin had a drum set and he was playing drums to Led Zeppelin and all this stuff and when he wasn’t at home, I’d get on his drums and just sort of start playing to it, you know, and then I wanted to play drums and I asked my mom if I had to play piano anymore and she’s like, "Not if you don’t want to," so then drums it was. Fergus Murphy Drums... And I mean this live element when you are recording, do you do all your drum sounds or...? John Tejada For the electronic stuff, it depends, I have in the past but definitely for the other project that I guess we’ll talk about, “I’m Not a Gun,” I’m playing live drums on all the tracks and live as well. Fergus Murphy Yeah so the live element has always been a big part of your music. John Tejada Yeah it depends, my brain thinks in two ways. I really like this programming side where it’s like a rush of programming something just right and really feeling satisfied in that way and then when we do “I’m Not a Gun,” it’s all about capturing a performance, like you know I was explaining earlier or speaking to you that when we do a live show, it’s totally different, I have to play it of course like a musician. But when you’re programming forever, you kind of lose sight of this stuff but we have to play our instruments you know, as perfectly as we can for 40 minutes and it’s totally different to do that or like for me to play a really cool drum track and then have that recorded and you captured it and it will never happen again you know and that’s like a totally different satisfaction, sort of split in my head in two different directions. Fergus Murphy Tell me about, obviously after a short period in Vienna, you moved back to the states and LA still is home, but there’s also a hip-hop past to your life. John Tejada Yeah, that’s also how I got into this music, you know. So drums and then we had a really cool station in LA that just came back but I’m not sure what the deal is but that’s a whole different story but it was called KDAY and it was sort of like the legendary Detroit station you hear of with the mojo on it... Fergus Murphy Electric mojo. John Tejada And this sort of big blend of sounds and DJing so we had a handful of DJs that a few of them became really popular guys and they would just have mix shows all the time and you would get a lot of the east coast hip-hop and a little bit of these West Coast producers but there was a big sort of electro scene in LA with the breaking and stuff and that music and there was some Detroit and New York stuff, lots of New York stuff. At the time that was all hip-hop and it was sort of the faster, futuristic hip-hop and I always sort of geared my ear toward that sound. Fergus Murphy What year are we talking about here? John Tejada Okay, this is in the ’80s, you know about ’85 I really at a young age was trying to follow this music as much as I could. Fergus Murphy What sort of artists do you mean when you describe it as futuristic faster hip-hop? John Tejada Well like, “Planet Rock” and Arthur Baker productions was getting heavy play and in LA, we had Egyptian Lover and Uncle Jamm's Army and they were doing appearances and a lot of DJs were specializing om that sound, like Chris "The Glove" Taylor and all that stuff, so just for a brief period you’d hear a bit of say “No UFO’s” by Model 500 mixed in with a 4/4 beat and then you’d hear more of that and maybe a little bit of early Trax Records and then somehow it just became another genre of, at least to me living in LA being a bit more out of touch than the rest of the world. I just sort of followed that and all of the sudden I was making techno or whatever and it just sort of grew out of hip-hop for me. Fergus Murphy At what point, so the DJing and you were playing drums and then DJing, when did that come into the equation. John Tejada Playing drums was really early when I was sort of trying... Fergus Murphy Yeah John Tejada Play some things when I was eight I think and then I started hearing the mix shows when I was twelve and I would hear people like Aladdin and Jo Cooley doing these tricks and I just had to learn how to do it, I’d take the home record player, you know like everybody else I’m sure messing up the home system trying to scratch and then finally getting enough money together for this really bad set of turntables to practice on. Fergus Murphy Can you still do a flair or a crab or... John Tejada I can do one quick flair and I can do a crabs but you know this back then this didn’t exist so it was about this Joe Cooley style, Aladdin, toggle switch, triple things and everybody had different names for the scratches but I can still get down. Fergus Murphy Yeah John Tejada I can still do it, if I have to. [laughs] Fergus Murphy There might be some challengers later. John Tejada I volunteer for a good loss. Fergus Murphy What name were you DJing under at that time? It’s a famous battle isn’t it, that’s what getting at. John Tejada Okay well there’s friend of mine in Junior High School that named me DJ Domino for some reason and I still don’t know why and I really, even at the time, I wanted to use my name and everybody was like, you can’t use your name, nobody uses their name. Fergus Murphy You have to be someone. John Tejada Actually when I was in high school, I was on a college radio show with a friend of mine, who passed away in LA but being in high school and totally disconnected, I had no idea, I knew we were on the radio but I didn’t think anybody was listening so apparently a few people I guess were getting to... Cut Chemist, he knew me from this show and battling locally and stuff but I was just enjoying doing it, I didn’t think anybody knew about the show or anything and his partner Newmark and I used to battle and we hated each other and then we became friends and I bought my first sampler from him back in like 1990. So that was a big step to start making my own beats and music. Fergus Murphy But you were sworn enemies. John Tejada Not really, we were in two separate crews and crews just all sort of hated each other but I didn’t have any problem with anybody, like I’d alway sort of see them and I’d be like, “Hey he seems cool,” you know, but then the crews would be like, “We’re going to battle you,” you know. And I was like okay and I’m the DJ to do it, so I’d just get thrown into these situations but it was fun. It’s competitive, I mean hip-hop always was with the dancing and the music and that was the sort of fun element that I enjoyed from that genre because it was all about outdoing the other guy and I think we’re all competitive but that just really was unapologetic about it which I think is kind of cool. Fergus Murphy Kind of primal in that respect. John Tejada Yeah. Fergus Murphy So hip-hop was good to you, I mean your first sampler, you bought it from Numark John Tejada Right. Fergus Murphy Do you remember how much you paid? John Tejada I think he overcharged me a bit. At the time it was just an EPS for a four time expander and I mean 1990 samplers, we had I think the choices were an EPS, they didn’t have the 16 plus yet or the SP 1200 but I really wanted to play with keyboard sounds as well because I was hearing this, trying to have ideas about maybe bringing back some piano playing and making some house or whatever I was hearing at the time, so it was between that and the W30 and older stuff and Newmark was using his EPS and showed me how to use it and I bought it. I think it was about 1500 US [dollars] at the time and he let me give him payments you know. Fergus Murphy An installment plan John Tejada Yeah stuff was expensive back then and you know. It’s amazing now a days, you get a thousand dollar laptop and you can produce anything if you put your time into it but you know we paid our dues I think, we had 12-second sampling time and you record everything super fast so you can have more sampling time. You had to work with what you had so I try to remember that in my way of working when I’ve got like a hundred plug ins to use and just sort of try to remember, “Think 12-second sampling times,” get a good idea down, you know. Fergus Murphy It was a rigorous training. John Tejada Yeah it was good you know. Fergus Murphy Working on the old machines... John Tejada They had a soul in them, they were all different, they sort of geared your sound. It was a special time I guess but I’m glad to be past it, I like my computer much better. Fergus Murphy You don’t make hip-hop music nowadays, do you really? John Tejada I mean, I incorporate it, we were speaking about these downtempo records I mean they’ve got elements of that. I think, for a lot of things that make happy creatively, for me at least, it’s a combination of styles you know, just whatever comes out. I still like to practice doing the scratches and try to learn something and I love watching people perform Fergus Murphy So you still get ideas from it? John Tejada Yeah, of course. The programming, the engineering and just everything about it, you know, like I said: It’s a bit slower but it’s the same idea, you’re programming beats, melodies, you know trying to get it to crack, sound as good as you can and in a way it’s all the same. Fergus Murphy Are there any particular artists that you really rate these days? John Tejada For anything? Fergus Murphy For hip-hop’s sake. John Tejada For hip-hop, I’m still partial to all the stuff I sort of grew up with you know like this early bomb squad production and this early Boogie Down Productions, Eric B Rakim stuff and the early Pete Rock stuff, that was just like, that made a really big impact on me. Fergus Murphy Yeah and when did, I mean electronic music you are describing the faster hip-hop and obviously you mentioned Egyptian Lover and Bambaataa and people like that, at what point were you tuning into European sounds? John Tejada I think when I was in the hip-hop the earliest thing European I might’ve heard was Simon Harris but of course there was Kraftwerk, you know and that was a big part of it, I discovered them really early on and I would kind of you know, nowadays, Computer World is like the coolest record ever, but when you’re in sixth grade and you’re listening to synthy stuff with German guys singing, you don’t really play it for your friends, because it wasn’t the coolest thing ever. I would listen to Computer World in my Walkman all the time and just be freaked out by it, that and a lot of early Art of Noise stuff. That was British, of course. Fergus Murphy You were a closet Kraftwerk fan? John Tejada Yeah. Yeah, except there was the one track off every album that, if you’re doing a DJ set everybody had two copies, but I enjoyed the albums all the way through. Fergus Murphy Yeah. In terms in being into electronics, you’re describing in the states, is it a... Obviously at that time you’re saying sixth grade in school, I can understand that you’re not necessarily playing it to your friends, but what was the environment like and what is the environment like in terms of making electronic music in the States? Which is pretty much dominated, as we know, by hip-hop. And country. John Tejada Right. I don’t know, it’s different for everybody. It’s sort of become a home base for me now. I get to come to Europe very frequently and there’s such a strong scene here. I think it just makes it difficult for people at the moment to do parties and to bring people. In a way, I remember when I was younger trying to collect the early Detroit stuff even, and a lot of the UK stuff that was at the same time coming over. I was super hungry for the sound, and it was really hard to find. It was only a lot of more progressive music coming over and it never really made it to the West Coast in a strong way. It was sort of like a few people that caught on, and now we’re all sort of producing things, but we don’t do too much in our hometown. Fergus Murphy Yeah, so you find your audiences would be largely away from the States? John Tejada I don’t know, really, but it seems like it, because... Fergus Murphy That’s where the records sell? John Tejada Yeah. The records are selling in other territories and the clubs are happening, so it makes sense that it’s... Fergus Murphy What about... You mentioned Detroit there, that was what I was going to next. What was it about that sound that tweaked your interest? John Tejada It was just special. Everybody, I think ... When I was listening to these hip-hop shows, one of the tunes, a lot of early Cybotron was being mixed in, and that was always really special. “R9” used to really freak me out. That was such a weird record. One of the first ones were the quarter note kick to start being played was “No UFO’s.” I remember the first time that when I was sort of half asleep and, I just remember god, that was a weird record. That really freaked me out, and that was like ’87. I don’t know, I mean, that sound is special to everyone. Fergus Murphy Rolling drums and... John Tejada Everybody sort of rates it as a very special, special thing. Fergus Murphy Yeah. Yeah. Play us something. John Tejada OK. What are we getting into? Fergus Murphy Something older, I think. John Tejada Older. OK. We will look. I’ll play something... I don’t know how old we can get, but we’ve got this sort of track from three years ago? I can throw it out there. Fergus Murphy OK. That’s old. John Tejada Well, no, not for me either. I mean, I’ve been putting out records for ten years, but I didn’t bring anything extremely old. Fergus Murphy Oh sure, three years is good. What is this track? John Tejada It’s a remix of a track I’ve done for my friend Dan Bell’s 7th City Imprint. And it was originally released and then I did a sort of remix and it’s called “Time Bomb.” Or maybe I should save it, because this is what I’m going to play with in Ableton. Let’s look at a different one, possibly. Getting used to this screen resolution. Okay. This is sort of similar. Another remix from the same period, about... Fergus Murphy Three years, is it? John Tejada A bit more recent, but otherwise I’ve just got the new album with me and you’ve got that. Fergus Murphy We’ll get on to the new album, and that’s yeah, no, just something... John Tejada This is called “Western Starland.” [plays short burst of audio] Whoops. (music: John Tejada - “Western Starland”) This reminded me that the whole segue of my sort of hip-hop influence, this whole track is sort of produced in a hip-hop sense. All the little bits you hear, the drums as well, it’s layered breaks, and instead of just speeding up the break, I was like fitting more of a house rhythm, and the little string and the wha wha. That’s from Zapp & and Roger and it’s all very hip-hop produced. In a way, that’s why it’s the same thing to me. It’s just like loads of rare groove samples, put together, but the result is more house, techno to however it sounds to people. This is sort of a big production influence in the stuff I do, from my hip-hop roots. It’s just sort of satisfying to... Found sounds and putting them together. I think in a different way as well, it can work. Fergus Murphy It’s also I guess coming from the DJing, the aesthetics of that, chopping up records and tricks... John Tejada Yeah. John Tejada Yeah, it’s... You know, a favorite pastime of mine. Fergus Murphy Yeah. John Tejada It’s just fun to chop things up and make new things with them. Fergus Murphy Do you ever use your little tricks these days when you’re DJing? John Tejada A little bit. I used to a lot more. I think people just want to dance instead of ... Sometimes I think it disrupts the flow, I think, like on Sunday night. I started to take double copies of some things, once in a while, and make some patterns out of them, and do a little bit of cutting and something, just to sort of... Fergus Murphy Keep you interested? John Tejada Yeah, I guess, or just to kind of show off, or something. Fergus Murphy Yeah. John Tejada Again, it’s fun. The whole thing, hip-hop, to take a piece of music and remix it on the fly is still something I enjoy doing a lot. Fergus Murphy Yeah, but mostly you use a program called Ableton? John Tejada For the live PAs, yeah. Fergus Murphy Yeah. John Tejada Especially with the new version with the addition of MIDI, it makes it so much more live. Instead of just working with the audio, which works so well, I can translate lines that are from studio tracks and make a MIDI synth play that. Then add loads of control to the MIDI synth and then have more control over all the channels and even the synthesis of some of the tracks. That gives it a much more live feel that just working with the audio. Fergus Murphy Mm. Do you want to give us a demonstration of this? John Tejada Yeah, sure, I’ll try. In the other piece that I was going to play instead of this one, called “Timebomb,” it’s sort of the same production style. Basically, a lot of things were taken off of rare groove records and combined with sort-of techno production. Then, for anybody that actually knows the tune, there’s sort of like new things put in it for the live version that are a bit cheesy to my friend who put out the original record, but it’s pretty fun when you’re playing it live. I’ll sort of fade in some of the elements and play a bit with it... Fergus Murphy How many people here, just before you start, John, use Ableton? One, two three, four, five, six. Okay. This new version is out how long? John Tejada About two, three months. Fergus Murphy Two, three months? John Tejada Yeah, this is a big, new upgrade to add the MIDI and everything in it. Actually, the newer productions I’ve been working on, I’ve just been doing in Ableton, because it has a sort of really cool, creative flow. I’ve just been starting to produce in it, and I think it’s not missing anything. I think it’s great for that. Fergus Murphy For producing? John Tejada Yeah. Fergus Murphy OK. John Tejada Yeah, I think it’s cool. Fergus Murphy OK. Just watching you play around there, it’s endless hours in the bedroom it could be. Not a hell of a lot different from practicing your scratches in hip-hop. John Tejada Right. I mean that’s the trick, is just how to figure out how to do it for a living. Fergus Murphy Yeah, okay. Have you figured that out? Do you make a living in music? John Tejada Yeah. I do, finally, and I’m really happy that that’s possible. It took quite a long time. Fergus Murphy What is the key to that? John Tejada It’s just starting to learn to do some business things and to do things right and trying not to not get screwed over, just to handle that side of your life if you choose to do it yourself, which is a big learning process also because you’re dealing with your art and you just really want to create and people want to make money. That can ruin it and change things around, so just to really be able to create and stay really happy and in control of things has been a long process to learn, I think. Still learning, but... Fergus Murphy But getting better at it? John Tejada Yeah, getting better. Fergus Murphy You have your own label. Is... John Tejada Yeah, it’s called Palette Recordings. I started it eight years ago, today maybe. I don’t know. It could be Palette’s birthday today. I’m not sure. We’ve got number 32 out now, which is great, I think. I was doing it in LA. I started recording for a few labels but also there’s this whole A&R process. There were tracks that I thought fit together really well and people would shoot you down, like “No, that doesn’t work.” It’s like, “Well, screw it. I’m starting my own label.” I expected to maybe get to number three and then run out of money, but luckily they’ve all made money and now we’re at 32 and on the iTunes store and have some CD compilations and lots of licensing. I couldn’t be happier, really. It’s been really good. Fergus Murphy Would that be the primary source of income, or is the DJing and... John Tejada It’s a combination of everything. It all makes everything else go around. The records are promotions for the gigs, the gigs help sell the records, the records are on the record label. It’s all a machine that works together. It’s all components that have to be going at the same time, at least for the way I’m doing things. Fergus Murphy Yeah. You’ve had some bad experiences with other labels, or... John Tejada Yeah. Everyone has, but you learn from it. You have to learn to be tough and take care of things properly and just do the best you can, really, unless you have someone looking after you. Fergus Murphy Yeah. John Tejada I prefer to stay in control of it myself, but... Fergus Murphy Your new album, is that on Palette? John Tejada No, we’re working with my collaborator, Leviste, who we were speaking with before, who I’ve been working with for 13 years, actually. Fergus Murphy Is he your production partner, or... John Tejada Yeah. Well, the releases we do have both our names on them, so that accounts for about half of the releases. Fergus Murphy What does he bring to the equation, or... John Tejada Well, we started together. We met through a mutual friend and we were just excited about this music that nobody else we knew seemed to know about and just started trying to make some. All my collaboration processes have been pretty relaxed. I figure it’s a collaboration and you have to give up 50% of the control. Sometimes I’ve tried some projects where that isn’t the case. Somebody has a really specific view of how things should be, but with me and Arian, we’re best friends for almost 14 years now. We just take turns in the chair and work on a piece. He can do whatever he wants. There’s rarely a time... There’s no arguments. I think at the most, it would be a moment where we both look at each other like, “That thing we just did really sucks, doesn’t it.” It’s like, “Yeah, okay.” We’re usually both in agreement about taking it out, but with that or with Titonton it’s just totally easy. Fergus Murphy Is this Titonton Devanté? John Tejada Yeah, another really good friend of mine. That’s the way I like collaborations. I think you’re not going to get 100% of what you want, and that’s the point of it. Fergus Murphy Could you play us something from your new album? John Tejada Sure. Fergus Murphy You mentioned this is not on Palette Records. This is... John Tejada No, this is on an LA label called Plug Research. I’ve done a few singles in the past for them, and I’ve also made one other album on it called Daydreams In Cold Weather. This new album is out this week. It’s called Logic Memory Center, and it actually features lots of guests on it to sing, which I don’t do so often, but I’ve got my friend, Jimmy, who’s in the Postal Service singing, and I’ve got my friend... (clapping from audience member) OK, we’ll play that one then. We’re got Kimi Recor, who’s my friend who’s on Gigolo doing this Invisibles project. Then we’ve got Carl Finlow singing, as well, who’s done a thousand things: Silicon Scally, Carl Finlow Random Factor. Spin me up. Play a bit of each vocal. Fergus Murphy Yeah, and was there a thinking behind this album when you set out to do it? John Tejada Well, I guess the overall theme is... A lot of my older music is very melody-based, my musical upbringing of always layered melodies. In a lot of my new production I’m trying to strip things down a bit to make one theme the main theme. That’s a newer idea. With this album, I guess I would call it my computer record. It’s all very heavy sound design, and it was actually also an effort to move away from a lot of the melodic elements. A lot of it is sound design. Of course everything has a tambour to it, and playing a note, but a lot of it it sound design, which put together again this hip-hop production of collage combinations of patterns and sound design. A lot of it is sound design and melodies come out of it, but it’s not really stacks of synthesism I’d usually do in the past. This first song with, it’s not Ben Gibbard singing but it’s Jimmy from Dentel singing. I really enjoy his voice. You can hear a bit of Miles Davis cut up in there from Bitches Brew and a lot of sound design and stuff. I’ll play this. This is called “Everything Will Be Okay.” Then I’ll play a bit of the Carl Finlow track. (music: John Tejada - “Everything Will Be OK" / applause) John Tejada Thanks. This is Carl Finlow who I swear could be a pop star. His voice is really beautiful, but as all of us, super embarrassed to hear their own voice. Fergus Murphy Was it your first time working with vocalists? John Tejada No, I’ve done a few things, but just here and there. This is the first album where there’s three vocal cuts and a few of the other ones feature some leftovers cut here and there. It’s definitely the most vocals I’ve used on a record so far. This is the romantic track that Carl really made it that. I actually had Carl Finlow sing to the track we just heard, and he’s living in Paris, so I sent that over to him and he sang to that. When I got it back, I had the intention of making a new track to it almost to remix it, but even when I heard him singing on it I was like it doesn’t sound like he’s singing on the track and so I created this new track around it and because of the lyrics I made it ultra personal and... I used a new software, also, like the older Meta Synth where you can analyze pictures, and I would load in pictures that meant something special to me and then the sound generated by the picture was used in the track as well. One of the first sounds you hear is from a special pictures. Knowing all these things... Audience Member Can you please repeat that? John Tejada It’s a software. The name slips my mind, it’s a new version. This older software Meta Synth, you could load in pictures and by additive, I could be getting this wrong so I’m sorry, but I think by the different harmonics, the different colors would represent different harmonics, so it would play through the spectrum of colors and you would get a sound. Most of the time it just sounds bad, but somehow one of the pictures I loaded in had a really beautiful sound and it was a special picture. That’s the first sound you hear with some drums, and then more of the sound design stuff and then Carl’s nice vocals. Carl sort of did his own multi-tracking of vocals. He wanted to give them to me all separately, but I felt what he brought to it was so special that I wanted a two-track balance. I wasn’t going to touch it. He put vocoders and all this stuff in it and pitch shifting, that was his input to it and I didn’t want to change it. When he heard it, it was a completely different piece of music. Luckily, he was okay with that. Fergus Murphy He liked it? John Tejada Yeah, he liked it. He thought it was better than what he sang to. Jimmy was happy with this piece and I was happy with all of it. I’ll play Carl singing. This is called, “Alone With You.” (music: John Tejada - “Alone With You” / applause) Fergus Murphy Johnny, I think it’s fair to say that at this stage there’s a familiar sound to your productions. What would you have to say about that? John Tejada I would hope so by now. Whether it’s slow or faster. I saw my dad who I’m sort of out of touch with, I don’t know if this is a compliment or put down, but I played him my latest piece and he said, “Oh yeah, you wrote something like that when you were five years old.” I guess I’ve always had this sound to me, but I think that’s a good thing. I would hope I have a sound by now. Fergus Murphy Yeah. What’s the process of achieving a sound? John Tejada That’s too hippy dippy to talk about I guess. Fergus Murphy Maybe not. John Tejada Feelings. I’m still enjoying, I’m only making music because I really enjoy it and I have to. A lot of times my titles hint to something being a musical diary like Daydreams In Cold Weather, and Logic Memory Center, it’s all cataloged experiences set to music in a way. I think that’s how I keep track of everything that happens. Fergus Murphy Feeding pictures into computers. John Tejada Yeah that too. That’s pretty literal translating of memory to music. Fergus Murphy There’s another project that you do called I’m Not a Gun. John Tejada Yeah, I’m Not A Gun. Fergus Murphy. Which is an entirely different thing, really is it? John Tejada Not if you ask me. But it’s based on, like I said way before, capturing a life performance playing drums and guitar. Lots of drums and guitar life playing. Fergus Murphy The guitar is very much up front. John Tejada The guitar is the main element I guess. I deal with another collaborative mind named Takeshi Nishimoto and we met about five years ago through mutual friends. Again, with Arian, we were hipped to the stuff that we were really influenced by that nobody else we knew seemed to know. And again, with Takeshi, it was the same kind of meeting and he started coming over ever Wednesday and we started jamming and putting down ideas. Eventually we made a first album. It’s on a Berlin Label called City Center Offices. We just released a new one and we titled it, Our Lives On Wednesdays because for five years now it’s been this tradition of Wednesday, calls, and he comes over. Every Wednesday this is drum and guitar day. He’s responsible for... I played a bit of guitar before, but he’s really responsible for teaching me so many things. He’s also responsible for the main complicated guitars while I’m just doing the little simple things. It’s also a lot of electronics from this kind of stuff. It’s more of a blend of things from when I was younger I guess. The electronic side and then drumming and playing instruments. Everything together. I don’t know how it would be categorized even. I can play a piece and... Fergus Murphy Future jazz? (laughs) John Tejada I don’t know. That future word. I don’t have a time machine. Fergus Murphy Go on, nail that word for us once and for all. What is wrong with that word? John Tejada None of us have a time machine. Sci-fi is the coolest thing to all of us guys, we love this thing of future, but to call, I couldn’t call my music futuristic, it’s something from now. Or influenced from things from the past. I don’t know. Retro, as Jake would say, retro futurist, I don’t know. Fergus Murphy Sometimes, you look at old visions of the future, say from the ’50s tell us more about the ’50s than they do about what was going to happen in the future. John Tejada Right. So many things are ... Fergus Murphy Do you think it’s the same today? John Tejada I don’t know. I don’t know. Fergus Murphy I’m just looking for you to drive a stake through the heart of that word. John Tejada Right. I don’t know what to say anymore. I will play a track from it and then if it makes anybody think of the future, then that’s great. Fergus Murphy Then that’s okay. John Tejada Yup. This is a new album which has been more electronic and on the rock side than the previous stuff. I’m doing the electronics and playing drums. Some of the guitar is mine, a lot of it is Takeshi’s. Fergus Murphy And you’ve been doing live shows with this in Japan recently? John Tejada Yeah, we got to do a few up there and a little bit in LA. It’s really fun because again, it’s like... Fergus Murphy What’s the live set up? John Tejada I’m using Ableton. I’ve got very stripped down ... Basically anything. Sort of like the computer is a third band member. There’s a lot of friends that want to play with us, but we’re very tightknit with our ideas and sometimes the thing with collaboration is you bring one person in and it can be really great, but all of a sudden they’re... We’re very much in agreement with what we want to do. We don’t need to risk somebody saying, “You know this part really sucks, you should do it this way.” Fergus Murphy It’s just the two of you. John Tejada The computer is our third band member and I’m using Ableton and any of the stuff we can’t recreate live is being played with Ableton. I’m getting a click-track and I’m also speaking instructions to myself of when to start and stop because we’ve got lots of starts a stops. Takeshi’s actually combining two or three guitar parts that we’ve done together or pieces I’ve played because he’s just that good. I can’t play very good. I’m never playing guitar on stage, so that’s our live set up. Audience Member You’ve also done remix of, “Such Great Heights,” Right? John Tejada Yeah, I’ve remixed all sorts of things. You mean of this band project, or of other bands? Audience Member I don’t know if you’re doing it alone, the track “Such Great Heights.” John Tejada Oh, yeah. I guess in a way that’s a very electronic band. It’s like this indie-rock, poppy, electronic thing. But yeah, I enjoy working on remixes that have a lot more acoustic elements and vocals and guitars and things and transforming that into my style. I’ll play one. I don’t know which one to play. I’ll play the first track. Fergus Murphy Your favorite. John Tejada I don’t know which one’s my favorite. (music: John Tejada - unknown / applause) Fergus Murphy It is quite different, really, isn’t it? There’s rocky elements. It’s a bit melancholy, maybe is it? John Tejada All of our stuff is. I don’t know. Yeah, melancholy. I don’t know. Fergus Murphy Any questions? Here. Oh, you’ve got one. Audience Member Can you tell a bit more about your broken side of things? The stuff you’re doing with Titonton. John Tejada Oh yeah, I’ve got one here. Fergus Murphy Get to use your... John Tejada Coming from a lot of hip-hop stuff, it’s fun to program different beats also because I’m a drummer. It’s fun to do this stuff. I think I’ve done some things in the past before people were calling it broken beat. I know Titonton loves this kind of sound. We’ve done two or three tracks in this style. For the most part it’s not so different to me. It has a strong fusion element for a few producers, which I always enjoy as well. Fusion, funky, jazzy, stuff I like that vibe a lot. Audience Member He’s an American guy, huh? John Tejada Yeah, he lives in Columbus, Ohio. I was telling a story earlier that ordinarily I’m trying to spend a lot of time to make productions the way I want them to be. In the past before I would knock out lots and lots of music, but when me and Titonton get together we’re really really limited on time, so both times we’ve done two EPs. One for my label Pallete and one for his, Residual, and both times we made the three songs in one day which was pretty trying experience. That’s telling you that when we made this one, when we heard it on the ride to the airport the next day we just hated it until I heard another friend of ours Dan Curtain come out to LA and he played the A side and I was like, “Oh what is that? I know that record, I really like it.” I never heard it again. I thought it was total throw away crap and then after I heard Dan Curtain play it I had to call Titonton and I was like, “Hey man, I heard the A side it sounds pretty good, man.” And he was like, “Okay let’s put it out.” I think this track was between lunch burritos and dinner. This is one of our more broken beat things. (music: John Tejada & Titonton Duvanté - unknown) Fergus Murphy That’s from an EP Freaky Deaky, Titonton Duvanté and John Tejada. Unless there’s any questions I will say a very big thank you, John, for coming in. John Tejada No problem, thank you. Fergus Murphy It’s been a pleasure, and maybe you play us out with something from the I’m Not A Gun, this new album with the guitar and live drums? John Tejada Sure, sure. Fergus Murphy Set us up nicely for Italian lunch in the courtyard. John Tejada Cool. Thanks everybody for coming to hear me blab on about... [applause]

Juana Molina
Juana Molina first achieved fame in early ’90s Argentina with her sketch comedy show Juana Y Sus Hermanas. Despite this success, she left acting behind for music, releasing her debut album Rara in 1996. The daughter of actress Chunchuna Villafañe and renowned tango guitarist Horacio Molina, Juana moved to Los Angeles shortly after her career change. There she began to experiment with electronic instruments, incorporating them alongside her voice and guitar.
20 years and five albums later, Juana has become one of the most celebrated experimental musicians in Argentina, with fans both at home and abroad – including David Byrne who, after discovering her second album, invited her to open his American tour. At this public conversation in Buenos Aires, Molina talked about recording at home, discovering loop stations and her artistic philosophy.
Hosted by Tito del Aguila Hello. Good evening. We are on the Red Bull Music Academy lecture couch. Juana Molina What’s the lesson about? Tito del Aguila This night we will share with you, in this great place, a talk, a conversation, with a singer, a songwriter, an actress who has conquered the world from here, perhaps quietly and secretly. This round of applause is for Juana Molina. Juana Molina Thank you very much. Tito del Aguila Great. The album [listening] will come almost at the end. I wonder if you saw
some of the... [gestures to video screen] Juana Molina It’s no longer there! Tito del Aguila I know. That’s odd. Then we can move on. I wanted to ask about the specifics of recording Halo. It was not recorded where you usually record your albums. Juana Molina Yes, it was after a year and a half I spent working at home with many technical problems, which Odín Schwartz helped me to fix. He solved many problems that came through. It was his idea to go record in a studio. “Come on, Juana, cut the crap, let’s go to a studio.” And I was like, “No, I like it here at home.” “Come on, let’s go to a studio.” So, things went on gradually... [brief applause] That was Odín applauding himself. So, at first I resisted the idea, because I’m used to working alone and entering some kind of tunnel, where I am some kind of guide and tourist of what is happening. Then I couldn’t get there, because every time I entered the tunnel something would break or... enough! So we went to the studio. Finally one day, testing some guitar gear at Eduardo Bergallo’s studio, we were playing really loud and I said, “Wouldn’t it be great if you could play this way?” So Bergallo and Odín
simultaneously said, “Let’s go to a studio!” So the deal was, I asked him to call Sonic Ranch, which was the place he proposed. I said, “OK, call and check if it’s possible.” And it was, so I decided to go into that terrifying experience of recording with other people next to me. Tito del Aguila We should tell our friends here that your studio is quite... Juana Molina Unequipped. Tito del Aguila Unequipped and isolated. You live in the suburbs. Your studio is actually in the center of your house, among your plants, so it was a change
also in this regard. Juana Molina We were surrounded by nature there too, a different kind of nature, which was a torrid desert. Skin, hair, everything gets really bad. After some days there you dream of bathtubs filled with oil. “Please, someone moisturize me.” But, beyond that, the studio was amazing, because we had it just for us. It was not from 8 AM to 2 PM. The door was opened, we stayed as much as we wanted, and the variety of instruments they offered was huge. We couldn’t get to try them all because it would have taken all three weeks. So during the first days we chose equipment, we chose the stuff we would work with. It was a bit hard for me at first – assistants were checking their mobiles and I thought, “Why do I need people here while I try to come up with an idea?” Finally I managed to withdraw from it all and started to enter the “studio” mode, which is completely different, and something different happened. Instead of going deep into the ideas that came up, I spread to the sides. I got a whole range of new ideas, in which I did not deepen, but I managed to store. We stored many timbres, new sounds, ideas... we recorded non-stop. We sometimes recorded a song for 40 minutes, so it was hard to edit it later, because you need to edit several 40-minute tracks then figure it out. It was a different experience, but I’m glad I did it, so I’m thankful for their idea. Tito del Aguila And for their persistence, right? Juana Molina Yes. Tito del Aguila And the process at the studio, preceded by the usual writing process at home, required long working days? What time do you feel is your best to work? Juana Molina At home? Tito del Aguila Yes, at home. Juana Molina When night falls. Something happens at night. It’s quiet. Birds go to sleep, so I don’t have birds singing in every song. Tito del Aguila How about dogs? Juana Molina There are fewer dogs too. There’s less of everything, so it works better for me. It works better for me acoustically and there’s also that quiet... well, it’s the night. The night atmosphere is different. Later on, once I’ve made progress in the process, I can work at any time. I’m really involved and hardly notice the time at all. But for the writing moment I like everyone to be asleep, that dreamlike thing, which is also the state I like to reach. Tito del Aguila I think we all know that dreamlike state by sharing your music. What is it like being in the studio and holding that feeling you’ve been working with? Is it like daydreaming? Is it much more mechanical? Juana Molina I always try to describe it in a different way, and the conclusion is quite the same, which is when I’m starting it’s like this here [points to CDJ decks on the table] with this play/pause button, tempo, on/off, fader, screen, whatever. Then as I go deeper, there’s suddenly a “bloop” – and I step like Alice through the studio. Then the abstract side of music appears. Although I am playing and I’m using equipment, it all disappears and images appear. The place is always quite dark. Some kind of shadows. That’s what I see, together with some doodles. And as I play, those doodles happen and I follow them. That’s why I talked about being guide and tourist. Because I’m playing it, but I feel I’m following the sound. I’m following orders from the sound. That’s why working at Sonic Ranch was so great. The textures that appeared there would not have appeared elsewhere. So, with new instruments, new ideas and arrangements, new album, all different. Tito del Aguila Was there any instrument that fascinated you so much you wish you could take it? Juana Molina Sure. That’s my usual mistake – wanting something and not doing it. That’s classic me. I wanted a
Moog
Prodigy, that was really [sings] “So, this love was born...” Really. It was something... “I love you.” “Me too,” it said. It loved me too, I know it did. Tito del Aguila It was mutual. Juana Molina It was beautiful. Tito del Aguila We will listen to it. Juana Molina So I quickly looked and there was one on sale. And I didn’t buy it! I didn’t buy it! Then Ernesto Romeo, who knows all about these things, told me, “If you had bought it, it would not have been the same. Because these are brothers. Watch out! It will be similar. It’ll be a relative. But it won’t be the same.” I think it’d have been quite good anyway. I feel really attracted to everything that produces bass sounds. And I strongly reject everything that produces treble sounds. So the mixing process is difficult, [makes incomprehensible bass gurgling sounds], because I can understand this sound but people cannot. Because it’s this, and another conversation like this one, and so on. Tito del Aguila The gullet. Juana Molina So I’m really enjoying it and the rest of the team says, “This is impossible to understand.” So they apply mid-range and treble, and I have to deal with it because… they are right. Tito del Aguila I can imagine. Is it difficult to mediate? Juana Molina Mediate? Tito del Aguila I mean, like a third party. Who balances the situation? Is it Odín? Juana Molina No, no. It’s an eternal dispute. I think they change it when I can’t see them. They just change it. Then I say, “Did you increase the mids?” “Just a tiny bit.” “Lower them.” And then it’s constantly like, [pointing to the corner] “Hey! Look!” Then they raise the mids. “But it needs boost.” “Leave it. Better too little than too much.” Tito del Aguila That’s what they say? Juana Molina No! That’s me! Better too little than too much if I’m not that sure. Tito del Aguila Eventually the final mix comes. What is that moment like? Juana Molina After ending this album, I decided – and I hope I can keep my promise – that next time I record an album I’ll leave it for a month at least. I’ll leave it macerating. Then I’ll listen to it. Then everything’s clear. After working so, so much, you are sometimes haunted by a sound and lose the overall perspective. These are just details. But I’d like to deal with them keeping a cool head. We have our breaks. Eduardo says, “OK. Let’s stop for an hour, grab a bite, rest our ears.” But your mind’s still there. An hour is not enough. It takes longer. Tito del Aguila What would be the ideal situation to listen to an album like Halo? Juana Molina Headphones... Tito del Aguila Headphones. Juana Molina Good headphones, a good stereo... Many times I work with headphones. I do it specially when I need such volume to clearly hear what’s going on, and maybe the sound is not that great at home. We didn’t use headphones that much this time, because the sound was great at the studio. But you have to be in a very dry place. Glass, glass, glass… Then you have a... an idea... Tito del Aguila A clearer idea? Juana Molina I can’t find the word. [An audience member shouts] What? Tito del Aguila You got help. Juana Molina But I can’t hear it. Tito del Aguila OK, so the idea is good headphones. Juana Molina I wanted to do this lecture with headphones but it was quite complicated. I wanted everyone to have good headphones, and then I thought, where would they plug them in? There must be a way. I think it just takes time and money to plan it. Tito del Aguila Next time... now you know what we’ll do after Halo. Juana Molina We could tell everyone to bring their headphones, but they might have those mobile phone headphones with no bass sounds. Tito del Aguila Now there’s even wireless headphones… Juana Molina OK. Next time we’ll use wireless headphones. Tito del Aguila Deal. Juana Molina And I can knead the mix for you. [Mimes operating a mixing board] Tito del Aguila Speaking about discography, you said that Segundo, your 2001 album... Juana Molina 2000. Tito del Aguila 2000? Why do I read Wikipedia? Juana Molina Wikipedia says 2003. The English release was in 2003. Tito del Aguila That’s it. Juana Molina But they didn’t print “Copyright 2000”, so I have to deal with the consequences. Tito del Aguila Sources are essential. OK then, when was Segundo released? Juana Molina It was recorded in 98 and 99 and was released in 2000. Tito del Aguila And you once said that that process of recording for two years paved the way for you to know what you really wanted to do with music. Juana Molina Exactly. Because the experience usually was what I described earlier. I entered some kind of… For starters, I didn’t know I was making an album when I recorded Segundo. I was making a demo. In those days demos came before albums. I think some people still make demos. I worked really hard on each thing. And at some point I thought, “How will I manage to do it all again and get the same results? This is the album!” Then I started to despair because some songs were really badly recorded. I didn’t have a clue. It was all recorded at this volume [makes a tiny space between finger and thumb] with a [mimics white noise] whooshing sound, real crap. So I recorded several songs again, and the result was cold as ice. There was nothing there. So I chose to leave it badly recorded. At that time I hadn’t heard about equalizers, and that’s quite important in a recording. Tito del Aguila The process was just you at home... Juana Molina The process was [hold the] microphone, [press] record. Instrument, record. At home it was just [press] “rec” and is it recorded? Yes. Done. And so I went on. My daughter was very young, so I had to work at night. It was impossible to work when she was awake. So I stayed up working until the wee hours, and I eventually fell asleep recording some keyboards. Really! I’m not trying to look cool or have an anecdote. I realized I was falling asleep, but I kept on recording. So the next day, I listened to it and… ! Because when I fell asleep, it was me who fell asleep, so whatever had to happen actually happened, and there was no finger pointing at me saying, “What you’re doing is a piece of crap. That’s all you got?” Because this jury of censors which drags me through life telling me what to do, all of them were knocked out. Then things appeared and, listening to them the next day, the question was, “How did this happen?” Tito del Aguila The dreamlike state again, right? Working at some level of... Juana Molina Yes! I played like I was following orders from the instruments, from the sounds. They took me. Segundo is full of things, there is a lot of pitch bending, non-stop pitch bending. [Mimes bending the pitch control while asleep and snoring] Tito del Aguila That was when you fell on the pitch and went back. Juana Molina I’d suddenly say, “I have to go to bed,” and fall asleep. That was impossible to reproduce. That’s why I decided it would be the album and not the demo. And I think in that album – which is endless! It lasts 75 minutes – I think there lies the seeds of all that came later. Tito del Aguila So it was in that passage between dreams and nodding off where you also found the setting for your recordings. I mean, today it’s quite common to see a live performance with a loop station. Juana Molina Loop stations didn’t exist yet. They didn’t exist at all, worldwide, back then. It’s true! Delay pedals and many things existed, but when I started playing live, for Segundo and Tres cosas… with Tres cosas, which is from 2002, I started to play more seriously. So I had two options: I could either use a backing track, which was a bummer to me, I had already tried it and by the third show I wanted to kill myself. I was like, [mimics performing while lost in thought] “Did I close the fridge? I think I forgot to call Camila! No way! I have to call her when I get home.” It was all mechanical, just death all around. Then I started using sequences, which was a feature the keyboard offered. I could sequence some musical beds. So I sequenced some stuff, but it was the same. And one day everything broke, everything breaks around me usually. It happened just half an hour before the show. So at the sound check I said, “Let’s try this song without the sequence… Not too bad. Let’s try this one…” Anyway, the audience was like 12 people, not 10,000. I tried. “Let’s see if it works.” It was all in line with my experience. So besides that option, which would not work, I could hire a group of musicians who would have to play the same thing all the time. But I thought, “If they are good musicians they’ll get bored playing the same thing all the time. And that boredom will show. People will notice they don’t enjoy playing so I will feel uncomfortable.” I kept thinking what they would think, without asking anyone if they wanted to do it. Maybe somebody did! I never asked. I thought, “If they are good, they’ll want to play something else. And I will not. I will have to use a whip.” I was in conflict with the idea of “you do this, you do this” without making others feel bad. So I thought, “What I need is a tool that starts recording when I step on the pedal, and when I step on it again, loops that.” So I went to every store, international stores in New York, Tokyo, L.A., Paris, London. I had the phrase totally rehearsed. “Don’t you have a tool that starts recording when you push and when you push again stops and…?” And I waited. [In English] “I don’t think so.” So I’d leave, quite frustrated, but I still persevered. Then one day I entered a store in New York, it was by that street full of music stores. “Don’t you have a tool that…?” “We’ve just received a pedal which, I think, does what you’re describing, I think.” I couldn’t believe it. “Shall we try it?” “Sure.” She took a microphone and plugged it into the device. “Try it.” [Sings a lyric and pretends to loop her voice] “I cannot believe it!” “Yes, I think you can record it again and...” I was shocked. Tito del Aguila You took it immediately. Juana Molina I bought another one three days later. I couldn’t believe it! I had spent years looking for it! Years! Tito del Aguila Amazing. Juana Molina It was a miracle! It was a miracle! Besides, I might have suggested, “Hey, how are you? Listen, I’m Juana Molina. Juana... Molina. M-O...” But you need to be someone to ask for something. I didn’t think of asking some nerd to do it. He might have done it. I didn’t think of it. But that’s what I found, and I started to play immediately with those two, which were not synchronized. So I looped it all and just prayed. And I guess they didn’t offer such fidelity as they do now. Tito del Aguila Audio fidelity? Juana Molina I mean, response to the gesture. In fact you needed to play it a bit earlier. For instance, the first loop was like [beatboxes to demonstrate the incorrect loop] then it went fine. I never knew why the first loop went wrong and the second was OK. Then I had to learn that mistake in every song, so it’d turn out OK. And the other station, which looped other things, I sometimes had to turn it on and off, press play and stop during the whole song, so they would go together. When I started it was like, I wanted to record in the middle of a phrase. [Sings] “I wanna escape this mess falling down ...” Then I did [demonstrates her uncoordinated attempt at looping] I couldn’t separate foot, mouth, voice, head. It was all like, “Now!” From the waist there was nothing. There was nothing. So I practiced a lot. Then one thing led to another and I started to write that way too. But I already had the loop mode before the loop station. I didn’t invent the loop, I mean... I used to play for hours and it enveloped me like a mantra, and all the tapes I recorded when I was 18 or 20 are called Inventions. Invention 1, Invention 2, Invention 3, Invention 4, and so on. Tito del Aguila 90-minute tapes? Juana Molina 90-minute tapes. The same thing during 45 minutes. A guitar going [sings riff] . and I kept playing it over and over inside my head, I was afraid of losing something essential. So I recorded until the tape jumped out. Then my invention was over. Tito del Aguila And you listened to it. Juana Molina I did. Then I got a 4-track portable recorder, where songs lasted 45 minutes too. But those were not songs but inventions. Inventions Vol. 2, 3... All the songs in Rara came from those inventions. And those “invention“ tapes are much more like the albums I did later on than Rara. Tito del Aguila Because a producer participated in Rara. Juana Molina Right. And I was very insecure. I thought someone had to tell me how to make an album. Someone had to tell me, “This is how you make an album”, and I’d go, “OK.” Then I did the album as they told me to. But then, though the album sounds great and everything’s swell… Tito del Aguila The producer of Rara was Gustavo Santaolalla, who heard that Juana wanted to make an album… Juana Molina No! I sent him my demo, because I really liked one of his albums, called Santaolalla. It had nothing to do with my stuff, but I found it very authentic and powerful. When I knew he was here I wanted to meet him, and brought him three songs. And he wanted to produce the album. He said, “First of all, you need a band,” and I said, “I don’t have a band.” So he kind of led me to what was fashionable then, which was alternative rock. And the album is good, but it lacks that inner world that the others have. Tito del Aguila When you talked about loops – I’ll rewind over that matter – once I read you referred to the loop as a wheel, which obviously is not the real meaning, but I liked it because a wheel goes somewhere. Juana Molina Sure. They talk about loops as a matter of repetition. And I think repetition in a loop would be a loosened wheel, passing by the same place once and again. And what I enjoy is when that loop, which is a wheel, sets on the road and moves forward. So the wheel moves forward doing the same, but the landscape changes. And that modifies the wheel. You are in a loop, but above it other things happen, and you’re on a little horse, discovering worlds around you... I go with that wheel. Tito del Aguila That’s the trip where you are the guide. Juana Molina Exactly. Tito del Aguila This might be the moment for you to tell us about influences. You also have a theory about influences, right? Juana grew up in a very musical house. Not just because her father, Horacio Molina, is a well-known tango singer. Your mom, Chunchuna Villafañe, is an actress, but she is also super melomaniac. Juana Molina She is super melomaniac, even today. Tito del Aguila So she played records when you were a kid. Juana Molina They played music the entire day. The whole day there was some record sounding. Lots of jazz, bossa nova, some classical music, that was less than the rest but they played certain pieces, and what else? Of course they bought Beatles albums. Something funny happened to me with the Beatles. Our first album was Abbey Road. Sorry, it wasn’t Abbey Road, it was Sgt. Pepper['s Lonely Hearts Club Band]. So I used to listen to Sgt. Pepper, then – I don’t know the order, we’d need a Beatles expert. I knew those albums very well. Then at my cousins’ I saw Help, for example. “Great! Another Beatles album!” So I played it... “Wow, The Beatles really plummeted!” I thought that was what they did after. So I thought, “What you’re doing now is not good, guys.” And nobody told me, because being a kid you don’t ask. My cousins and I were eight or nine years old and they had the complete collection of the Beatles’ albums. I don’t really know those songs because I never had those albums. Not Help nor Rubber Soul, which is great. I did have the White Album. Is it before Sgt. Pepper? No. It’s previous. [Audience shouting] Is it? No! It’s subsequent! Tito del Aguila [To the audience] You’re worse than Wikipedia! Juana Molina That makes sense. It’s subsequent. So I had Sgt. Pepper, the White Album, Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road. We did not have Revolver. We didn’t have the best one. That one made me jealous of my cousins, because they had it and I thought, “This one is good.” But telling [my parents] to buy it didn’t cross my mind. I had to go to my cousins’ to listen to Revolver. Tito del Aguila Music would arrive home or you’d hear it there. Juana Molina It just didn’t cross my mind, buying a record, or asking for it. It was a different time too, when things came gradually. It was an album every three months. So for three months, six months or a year, I’d listen to a record which I really liked. When I was 12 my dad bought me Larks’ Tongues in Aspic by King Crimson, and that day I became somebody. Tito del Aguila That’s an influence. Juana Molina Sure! I’d take a speaker, put it here [mimes placing speaker by the side of her head], take the other speaker, put it here, I’d lie on the floor, set the needle... and die. I died listening to all that. We wanted to play an amazing part of that album here today, but it’s nowhere. Tito del Aguila Not on YouTube, nowhere. Juana Molina They kept it all for themselves. There’s nothing anywhere. That album is not online. I always tell this anecdote, because I think it’s amazing how perceptions and feelings work. There was a part of a song which started with some guitars. [Sings riff] It turned more and more dense, then suddenly a window with a curtain appeared, together with the shape of a couple. She was blaming him, whom we didn’t hear. And I heard [sings incomprehensibly, as if crying and arguing] Always at that part this lady appeared with all those problems. Tito del Aguila You heard and saw that. Juana Molina Sure. That part arrived together with the lady, the curtain, the window, the darkness, me outside, always the same. Years later, many years later, when CDs appeared, I immediately bought “Larks’ Tongues in Aspic” remastered. I bought it, put it on, and when it was time for the lady to appear, what appeared instead was [mimes playing guitar] Tito del Aguila A solo. Juana Molina Some gentleman playing a solo. I guess they thought, “This is not clear, it sounds like a lady arguing by a window. Let’s make clear it is a guitar.” They ruined the song for me. It just turned into, “Uh, it’s just a Fripp solo.” There was nothing interesting about it. I just listen to the vinyl of that album. Because there are all the paths, everything. Every time you listen is like when you take the bus... no matter the transportation, the point is you don’t have to drive, so you can watch. So let’s say you take the bus to school. You see the red awning, the green door, the store, that traffic light, a statue, and no matter if you make that trip 200 times a year, you will always see the red awning, the store, the statue... you don’t see the rest. As if we’d draw a path when listening or watching, and would always pay attention to the same things. Something will always catch you and make you listen. I like the music to be that, and instruments to be what that word indicates – a means to reach something general, which is music. So I don’t like it when you say, “Great bass!” “That’s some guitar!” “Spectacular keyboard!” I don’t like it when that happens. I like something to happen. I want the lady by the window, and other things to take me away from those guys there playing like assholes. [applause] Tito del Aguila It happens to everyone, they all see ladies and windows, or something like that, when they listen to Juana. We are heading towards Halo. But first I’d like to ask you about the live performance, being a shy person, right? Juana Molina Right. Tito del Aguila And how were those... Juana Molina I also have the theory that shyness is the other side of vanity. “Oh, no, I’m so ashamed!” “Why so ashamed? Go sing! Cut the crap!” Am I right? That’s how it is, I have to admit it. In my early years, once, I was playing at... I forget the name of this little pub, by Serrano Square. And there were people yelling, “Do the Korean impression!” I remember feeling so hot with the sweater I was wearing, but my clothes underneath were not OK. So I just kept sweating, drops falling from my head as people screamed, “Play some character, Juana!” And trying to balance it all I was like, “Well, this is the musical character.” And my fingers, all the time… [sings with wobbly voice, trembling fingers] I was terrified! And some kid, sitting in the first row like this [folds her arms] said, “Sing, Juana.” He spoke to me with such authority, so seriously, that he put me in my place. He slapped me. Do what you have to do and cut the crap. So I was like, “Oh, he’s right!” And I started singing. I was doing it a little better and also felt that someone cared – he was not asking me to play a character. I think there were eight of them here, and 10 over there, asking for characters –the Korean woman, the cosmetologist… Tito del Aguila And that voice helped you... Juana Molina He helped me. We became friends later on. Those are small slaps that put you in your place. People need someone to put them in place when they are out of place. Then once in Chicago I went on the stage and it was as if some kid had gone there to arrange some wire. Just the same. The place was crowded but not for me. I was opening, so I went on the stage and I saw there was no [audience] I was outraged. “I’m leaving. Fuck them all. What is this?”. And instead of leaving, I did “bam”, and I started with “Martín Fierro”, and being on a keyboard, something more distant, your fingers don’t shake so much, you lean on the keys so the keyboard sort of supports you. So I started. I entered that playing trip, the world disappeared and the show was great, leaving aside if people was listening. At some point it was like an insight. I thought, “There is nothing, nothing you can do to get these people’s attention. Nothing. So, do what you have to do. And that’s all.” Tito del Aguila And they will be there. Juana Molina No! I don’t know what will happen. After a few songs there was some kind of attention, but the main thing is that I managed to stop thinking what others would think. Like the joke about the jack, right? I’m sure nobody knows it, or many. The one about the jack. But I would have to say a curse word at the end! Audience member Tell it! Juana Molina It’s really long, but I’ll sum it up. Then you tell it properly. It’s about this guy whose tire goes flat. Now don’t start, “That one, huh?” I’ll tell it anyway. He’s just surrounded by darkness, right in the middle of The Pampas, absolutely nothing around him, with a flat tire. “Fuck it! I can’t believe it! What am I gonna do now?” He gets out the car and starts looking around. And over there, far, far away, he sees this tiny light. “Hey! That must be a house! I’m heading there! What if they are sleeping? Perhaps they are in trouble, or the light is on but they’re sleeping, or they’re doing something and I’ll interrupt them just to borrow a jack to lift the car this late... the fact is I need it, I can’t stay here all night.” So he keeps walking as he thinks about everything that will happen to him. “Maybe they are having some romantic action and I interrupt them. They will hate me!” And he keeps thinking as he approaches the house. He finally knocks and a man opens the door: “Hello, how can I help you?” “You know what? Stick the jack up your ass!” That’s what it was. Tito del Aguila We are almost… [Applause] Juana Molina It’s too long to work. Tito del Aguila We’re leaving. We’ll leave you all with the music. We’re finishing up. Juana Molina Are they making this gesture? [Twirls her finger] Tito del Aguila I saw a light passing by. Juana Molina They do that a lot on TV. Tito del Aguila Yes! You know about that. I saw a light. Juana Molina will soon be presenting Halo on May 17th in Niceto Club, but you will get to listen to it before that. Juana Molina Yes. You will not hear the whole album. I scammed you. It’s too long! First I’ll show a video, which some might have already seen. I think it’s awesome. Tito del Aguila But you won’t see it on YouTube. Juana Molina No, you will watch it here, on this beautiful screen. We hope we can watch it properly. And when we hear the album later, we won’t listen to that song. So I had my doubts, because there will be a song next to another one which is not the perfect match. It will not achieve the effect it had in the mix, when we said, “This song goes after this one. I’m not sure. Yes? No? It goes here!” That song won’t be there, so it will be kind of weird. And I’m not going to play either… [Responding to audience member] What? They don’t want it! It’s not my decision! It wasn’t me, it was the production. They said, “The album is too long, let’s play it shorter, because people are going to get fed up.” No idea how many songs they took out. We also took out the song we used in the promo. And there’s another one missing, right? There were three. Tito del Aguila We had to choose. The order came from above. Let’s give Juana Molina a big round of applause!

Kim Changwan
A musician since his early teens, Kim Changwan set off a revolution in Korean music in the early ’70s when he formed the band Sanullim with his brothers, Kim Chang-hoon and the late Kim Chang-ik. Together they explored a warm and fuzzy sound that deviated from the norms of Korean pop and rock, going deep into the same aesthetics that had defined Western garage and psych scenes a decade earlier. Crucially, Sanullim’s explorations were not driven by knowledge of their counterparts but by a desire to rebel and push against the strict norms of Korean society. With more than ten albums to their name between 1977 and 1984, Sanullim quickly cemented their place in Korean history. Following this success, Changwan further explored his creativity as a producer, film composer, actor and writer. He remains a beloved public figure and continues to write and perform as the leader of the Kim Changwan Band.
In this lecture at the Red Bull Music Academy Bass Camp Seoul 2017, Changwan sat down for a rare conversation that delved into the drive behind Sanullim’s music, his early electronic and production experiments and his desire to keep searching for meaning.
Hosted by DJ Soulscape Hello, nice to meet you. For everyone who is here today, we have invited someone who is very difficult to meet even once in a lifetime. I am honored to be here as the organizer of this event. I would like to thank Changwan for accepting the invitation and also the audience who have been here since the early morning. My name is DJ Soulscape and this is Mr. Kim Changwan. [applause] Kim Changwan Hello everyone. I’m happy to see you. DJ Soulscape Mr. Kim Changwan, I am sure all of you know him very well but let me give an official introduction. Sanullim was a band that was very important in the history of Korean music, not only for its fame but in terms of music history or the changes in musical style, or in dealing with very Korean elements or themes. Through the late ’70s and the ’80s, they put forth the definition of Korean rock. There are many other elements. We’ll cover them today. There are elements of post-rock, new wave, and even music with a very electronic approach so we have brought all that music here today. In a way, from my perspective, these are things that I would bring up with him and say, “Wow, you released this kind of album?” So these are the tracks that I would ask him about personally. Really, so many people here are musicians and producers, so there are many things that they can learn from Mr. Kim. First, let’s skip most of the typical questions or information we can find online, because searching online is very easy these days and you can look up most of the basic information. Of course if there are things we can go into more detail we’ll talk about it. People who are gathered here are from a wide age range so some people here might not know that Sanullim started with three brothers. The younger generation might know about you through the Kim Changwan Band. It would be great if you could tell us a little about the band’s early days. Kim Changwan It’s on record that we debuted in the winter of 1977, but it really started when I was freshman at college. Our origin goes back to 1971. I was 17 in 1971 and my brothers are all two years apart. So the second brother was 15 and the last one was 13. That was the beginning of Sanullim. But actually our world of music back then was too parochial and entirely consisted of stuff we learned in the elementary and middle school music classes. So Sanullim began without knowledge in music and that’s why it’s pointless trying to discover the musical disposition of our band because we didn’t really know music. There were also no one in our family, like our mother or father, who did music. However, I didn’t know what it was, but music fascinated me more than any other games could. So when we were 17, 15 and 13 years old we would drum spoon cases and play acoustic guitars and have such an exciting time. It was so interesting, how we would have so much fun playing this game everyday. So we never thought we would do some kind of music but it’s just that we were into playing music much more than any other game our peers would be into. DJ Soulscape This might be an inappropriate question. Have you ever thought that without your brothers, you wouldn’t have felt such a big fascination for music? Kim Changwan Yes, of course, now that I’m doing the Kim Changwan Band, I keep asking myself how it’s different from Sanullim. There are things that can’t be explained. Something the Kim Changwan Band can’t emulate. It might be something that only brothers can have. As Sanullim we crossed over to many different genres like electronic music that were difficult to do in the music industry at the time. In retrospect, we enjoyed these unknown things. We didn’t just try to express the things we were familiar with but enjoyed the unfamiliarity. Also, most of all, if there is one thing that Sanullim first challenged the established music scene with, it’s the form. That’s what we first rebelled against. At the time, lyrics were put on music according to a fixed form but that was like wearing uncomfortable clothes. I said this in an interview at the time, “If you are sad, just cry. Isn’t writing sad songs kind of hypocritical?” The frame of that fixed form. It was a rebellion against fixed form lyrics to start a song with, “Doesn’t have to be”. Having that fixed form made me want to destroy other values like aesthetic views. So we destroyed the lyrics first then destroyed the melody. We kept growing our ideas and kept on challenging. At the time, we gradually started challenging our set values and established orders. So first we threw off these uncomfortable clothes by throwing off the fixed form lyrics. Then we threw off the melodies. Then we started challenging those ideas that we should just put our head down, study and listen to the grown-ups. Actually we wrote so many songs but they all couldn’t pass the censorship. So the lyrics had to be changed or we had to use sarcasm. All the things we wanted to express openly are all submerged. But on the other hand having to submerge these metaphorical and subtle messages rather than explicitly expressing them became a shield that preserved our values for a long time. It became a shell and helped our true values survive until now. DJ Soulscape So in a way, you created a shield. Kim Changwan Yes, it became a shield. Also, it’s kind of awkward but if you are here in this hall to discover something you can use for your career, and I’ve been talking about fixed form and my experience starting, I’m not trying to give you guidance. I reject such things. So what I’m saying here today is something you must escape from. It shouldn’t be a goal for you. It is your choice but that’s what I think. Start off from where I am. Honestly, I don’t know a lot of things. I thought I would learn the answer a little by little throughout my life but I gave up a long time ago. I don’t even think it’s important to know the answers. Accepting that you don’t know much about the world is sometimes very comforting. The unknown world and the fact that we existed in this mystical world, this miracle, gives me that scent of life that I haven’t felt before. Once I know something for certain, I begin to doubt it. This is my habit. Even if I were happy, as soon as I realize that I’m happy, I doubt my happiness right away. Whenever I was certain of who I was, as soon as that thought hit me, I have always destroyed it. So today I stand before you, not as Kim Changwan who comes in a certain form or a meaning but as Kim Changwan who is newly formed with you. That’s my wish. Min Jun [Soulscape] is someone who always feels fresh. He is always changing and dynamic. He feels that way a lot. DJ Soulscape Thank you. So I actually thought that with the music I brought today, your music and the associated image that I got from listening to them as I was growing up and the image I had after actually studying it, and also what you have explained just now are all very different. Some of your more stereotyped work are the ones that are well known, and then there are your children’s music albums that we have grown up with, and we heard your folk hits, and also on TV or through media we see a certain one dimensional image of you and your band. But once I looked into your albums I found a sound that’s sometimes more rough or really urban, or albums by Hyunhee that you always describe as a “ghost’s wail.” Those elements, if we look and try to find another band who rejected and deconstructed sounds like you did, we can’t. Especially from the late ’70s to the late ’80s, the music scene pursued a specific type of popular music but they didn’t really go for something iconoclastic. I really cherish the idea of the so-called leftfield among DJs or electronic musicians. This radically progressive and outside-the-box approach to music is much needed. Because the equipment we use and the methods have become very standardized. Everyone has the same standard equipment. So it has become much more important to bring your personality and ideas. Something I felt while studying Changwan’s music over 20 years is that this deconstruction is something that’s very difficult to do as a band. In my opinion. Because in general, when you meet a friend or two and form a band, this radical thinking and deconstruction is difficult with another person. You can get into a lot of conflict. But I thought maybe as brothers you had a chemistry that let it happen? Kim Changwan That’s right. Certainly. I can’t just point to the brothers’ chemistry as the answer but it’s true that it’s there. Even as we brothers were doing music together, what’s important was the process of coming to an agreement. The kind where we were in a tacit agreement to deconstruct an established form. If it was between other people, during that process one’s ideas can change. That process can make you deviate musically. It can blur the theme although it might make the song popular, it will castrate the uniqueness. So the fact that we have gone through the trouble of doing music only between us brothers may have set the stage to do something provocative. Another important environment was that until the early ’70s or even the late ’70s, the main consumers of music were adults. The establishment. The kind of music that took the center stage was what we call old people music today. But our band’s music was continuously excluded from the scene and persecuted and censored by the ethics committee. So we were in this very bad environment to do music. But if we were acknowledged back then as “good music,” it would have sucked a lot of the enjoyment out of doing music for us. We were greatly persecuted and branded as fringe. That bolstered our youthful passion. It was euphoric. We kept hiding from their eyes and attacked the values that they held dear. That was the circumstance that allowed us to do music everyday with joy. Of course we were brothers and that kind of environment kept us close and became a fertile ground for us to keep our spirits up. It stimulated us. All these things would have ended if it were just us and them. But there was a bigger current. The old people music, the market and the consumers that mainly consisted of grown-ups was quickly eroding and the base was moving towards younger people. This transformation of consumers reached the college music scene, or the early ’80s ballads, or if we go a decade later into the ’90s even the elementary school students. This gigantic current has kept Sanullim’s music floating. If we did music for the establishment, something that fits their values, and was cheered instead of persecuted, we would have been ignored by the youths. But instead, thanks to the establishment that forced us to study in school and refused to recognize our music, we have become core to the tastes of young people. That has continued until today. DJ Soulscape Yes, that seems like a really important point. Kim Changwan So some would say that they are producing music in accordance to that value but that’s as difficult as planning social values. If one tries, they would put out slogans like, “The biggest strength is love,” or, “The biggest strength is honesty,” or, “It’s the youthful spirit.”. But whether these values will stick is a mystery. But there will be attempts that take a stab in the dark. Something you might want to try. So we might have a few lessons here. Like the fact that the establishment that hindered and refused to recognize us have given us fertile soil, the things that make you uncomfortable now or make you want to rebel against and resist could give you your biggest and most precious values when it comes to doing music and art. DJ Soulscape Since we are on the topic of resistance, it would be good to listen to a song. This is from Sanullim’s second album. “Spread the Silk in My Heart.” (music: Sanullim – “Spread the Silk in My Heart”) It takes 3 minutes to get to the vocal part. On the airwaves, this was the most loved song from the second album and of course there are songs like “Let’s Sing” and “What Will Happen to Me” but this is the song that most shocked people. Maybe, it’s the first memory of Sanullim for many. My uncle first played this for me when I was in elementary school. As soon as I heard it, I thought, “It’s scary, hope it ends soon.” Once the voice starts it’s good but that intro made me think, “What are they trying to do?” Curiously, that’s what got stuck in my memory. My grandmother didn’t let me touch the record player at the time because I might break it. I always waited for my uncle to come home from work and kept asking him to play that same song over and over. I was allowed to listen to this song because the adults had heard Sanullim’s children music album first so they thought they can play Sanullim for me. But after my grandmother heard me playing this song over and over she wondered if this song was appropriate for me. I think it was a kind of resistance for me. Having them tell me not to listen to it. Them asking me why I’m listening to it. I enjoyed that. Listening to something that is beyond the children’s music that everyone gets, something that is from the unknown that only I can understand. Something I want to understand. That kind of feeling might be something that you were trying to describe earlier. What I was most curious about was who came up with the idea to write a song with this kind of structure and whether one of the three brothers asked, “When do we finally start singing?” Also, I have heard a story from a producer who worked for a long time at KBS radio. He was asked to cut out the intro and play the song but as far as I know, the song was played in its entirety. The department head who I worked with told me that story with pride. He just went for it and played the whole thing. Kim Changwan People say Korean pop music is three minutes of art. When the record first came out, it played for the first time on CBS’s noon program. As soon as it came out, I went to a famous producer, Kim Jinsung. He said, “Oh, a new record came out. OK, I’ll play it as the last track quickly.” And then he played it. [laughs] So he played it and the beat goes. As it went his face turned dark. “When is the voice coming? When does the song start?” [laughter] And then while the intro was still going on, it went to time announcement. And then the radio stations requested that we cut the intro out and re-do the song. Before that we had the song “Already Now” from the first album and it had a lot of fuzz, which is a type of distortion effect. They thought it was all noise. So they asked us for a new record. They said that there was too much noise and asked us to bring them a record that’s in better condition. So we explained, “That’s the sound.” But they would say, “That’s the sound? No, it can’t be. The record must be defective.” DJ Soulscape At the time, to allow for this kind of recording and this kind of album to be published, there must have been a progressive minded label or a manufacturer? Kim Changwan Yes. These days, the music is too industrialized so it can be more difficult to make these kind of rebellious attempts. But I think that times are also changing. I can’t comment just from my hunch but there is a new generation coming up who admires the recklessness of youth. When that time comes, although Sanullim has been the symbol of change for that era, perhaps new experiments like that need to happen. DJ Soulscape Forever. It can’t stop at the current level. Musically too. Kim Changwan Of course. DJ Soulscape In that sense, if I were to ask you in terms of music. I have been playing the song, “Let’s Sing.” If you look at the beginning, there are fuzz and flanger effects. So you have these guitar sounds with a bunch of effects. The fact that you made music with this sound is impressive. It really makes me jump when I hear the intro. At the time, you created all these sounds using equipment and effects pedals and production methods all without a proper producer but just yourself. I’m curious about how you came to do that. Kim Changwan I don’t know. These days there are all kinds of effects but at the time there were only a few special sounds. But these sounds were night and day compared to the kind of regular guitar sound. It was such a different world so by just using the effects, we felt we could make a very different music and give a very different feel. But today there are too many effects. It’s like having a hard time choosing an item at a store when there are too many options. These pedal effects cancel each other out. The variety isn’t really important in stimulating the imagination of the listeners. We have been doing two-track recording since our first album and we only started multitrack recording on the seventh album. We had these equipment and things that were being developed, which gave us hope for a better sound. We thought doing multitrack recording would be great with editing and have many benefits. But turns out, it lacks in a few aspects, including sound itself. So recently although we had to use multitrack recording, because that’s how equipment are set up, as the Kim Changwan Band we have been using the same method we used with the two-track recording on a lot of our music. We’d rather do that recently. DJ Soulscape I heard that too in an interview so I brought the seventh album here today. When I listened I actually didn’t realize that this is a multitrack recording. (music: Sanullim – “Don't Go”) But after listening to the sound I could tell. All on separate mics. They are isolated and each vocal track seems to be in a different space. But at the same time I felt that you didn’t do multitrack to get a good take but to have more of an ensemble sound. So I think the song “Don’t Go” is the most prominent example of that. It utilized the strengths of multitrack recording while keeping the ensemble’s sound as is, even including the sound of clanking together between the bars. But like we discussed earlier, this might be possible because you were brothers in a band. I think that because the song doesn’t follow a certain musical form or convention. I’m also curious what you thought at the time so I... Kim Changwan But really after we did the multitrack recording, we compared our sound to foreign recordings since that’s all we could do. My sound was very, how should I say, thin. It wasn’t as effective as we hoped. There was much we had to overcome in terms of sound and recording engineering. These days recording technology is much improved but when we were releasing that music, I wasn’t a fan of it. DJ Soulscape But from what I heard from the engineers who did the mastering at Seoul studio and the people who pressed the record at the plant, much of the sound quality was lost in the process. Cutting out the sound arbitrarily during mastering or cutting the bass in order to jam more on the record. I heard that happened all the time. Kim Changwan Actually if you compare the sound from the master tape and after it’s pressed on vinyl there was a big difference. It was like you know the talkies? How there used to be a separate soundtrack that accompanied the movie reel. It sounded drawn out and compressed like that. It’s a very slightly pressed sound. It came out with a buzzing sound so we really hated the sound of vinyl. But today we listen to mp3s which have an even smaller bandwidth so the musical environment is really bad. So many people go to LP bars now. The sound is totally different. Even if you have a flood of equipment and music, what’s the point of it? There is actually that sensation that sound can deliver. How can we feel that listening to the music as we do today? (music: Sanullim – “Tales From a Faraway Land”) DJ Soulscape There are similarities between the music we have played today. In Korea we identify them as the music of Sanullim but outside, they would call it Korean psychedelic rock or Korean no wave punk. In a way, these are the kinds of music that didn’t exist in Korea but existed outside so they could be classified into categories. So in that sense, I think that the tracks that weren’t renowned in Korea are being recognized internationally. Were you in an environment where you could listen to psychedelic rock or punk music back then in Korea? Kim Changwan No. That’s very important. We didn’t know. If you look it up, the Sex Pistols and we debuted in the same year. At the time, musicians who were categorized as punk were banned from playing in Korea. They couldn’t even be introduced. So there was no punk subculture or punk musicians introduced to Korea. Of course, there were pirated copies floating around. DJ Soulscape As far as I know, even the pirated copies of the Sex Pistols were only distributed after 1980. Kim Changwan That’s probably right. Before that those were big taboos. We did music with psychedelic and punk elements out of ignorance, not because we knew something. We made those without even imagining that music like that already existed in the world. Albeit we did make them with the sole thought that it would pain the grown-ups when we released the songs. The music that pained the grown-ups was all barred from being imported. What’s this song right now? The title? “Tales from a Faraway Land.” This is a song I wrote after looking at the walls of Uijeongbu City Hospital. A song about death. This was taboo. Especially if a young kid sings about death, it would be considered degenerate. I’m sure you have heard this but there is a song called “Just the Two of Us.” The song goes, “If I had a sweet lover beside me, how great would that be?” This was considered pornographic. “Just the Two of Us” was censored for being too pornographic so I’m not exaggerating if I say that there was almost no music that young people could sing openly at the time. DJ Soulscape I heard this many times from people in the radio and TV. The original and unique lyrics in Sanullim’s music was a result of censorship that tried to catch them at every step. It developed its own color while taunting the censorship by straddling the line. So that’s what they think. What do you think of that? Kim Changwan I think they are putting us on too much of a pedestal. But this has happened. Censorship committee members were checking the music sheets. They would sometimes reject a song if it ended in a certain chord or didn’t end cleanly because that might have uncertain nuances. So I wondered what they would do if I did something different. I wrote a whole sheet of music without separating the bars. I just wrote at the top of the song that this song has no bars. DJ Soulscape You didn’t separate the measure? Kim Changwan No. No separation. If you sing it, it’s unmistakable that it’s four beats but I got rid of the measure. I was wondering what they would decide but it got passed. So I thought to myself, “Wow, that’s strange. This kind of sheet can pass.” So that happened. There was always a constant friction against the establishment. DJ Soulscape But this seems to be more than friction. This kind of environment was something incomprehensible to common sense so maybe you were pushed to the extremes of experimental music? I think that might be the case. Kim Changwan [laughs] We didn’t have that power. There was a great force. Now that the censorship is no more, it doesn’t really warrant a discussion. But there used to be a time when music was censored and even now in a way there might be another environment that controls us. I hope you will destroy those shameful devices [points to smartphone] with your own hands. DJ Soulscape Many of the people who gathered here including myself are music producers, although some of you are singers and rappers who take the center stage, these days the producers and beat makers are behind the scenes. So although you are making the music I’m sure there are many cases where the singer, the label or the management forces you to do a certain sound, whether you are aware or not. Although the nature is commercial rather than political, I feel that this kind of environment could be similar to the persecution in Mr. Kim Changwan’s time. Do you agree? Kim Changwan That’s a great comment. Back then when Elvis was the king, it was clear who was in charge in the music world. But the big artist is getting smaller and the supporting artists are becoming more prominent. Music itself too. What we have known as music is now deconstructed through different genres like rap and hip-hop. This is not so much that we are losing sight of the main component but we could actually be getting closer to the answer of the question, “What is music?” So if there comes a stage where there is no main artist, then that might be a place that’s closest to the essence of music than we have ever been. If we don’t doubt our understanding of music, then the music won’t reflect the current moment. It will be stuck in the museum. But I am sure that all these new experiments reflect the new environment for music. Also, we spoke a bit earlier about equipment, there are millions of samples on the computer. So anyone with a finger can make something like music. They can do that. So the current music environment feels like we are fully fed up to our necks but it’s also somewhat suffocating us. We don’t know what it is but it’s frustrating and I think many of you feel the desire to break out of it. I’m sure something will give. When I see you, I think everyone has an exit. DJ Soulscape No, we have no exit. Kim Changwan Also as I make more music, the less I know about it and the more I want to go back to the past. We sang, “Doesn’t have to be, feels like being on a cloud.” We pulled that unlikely melody out of thin air. I don’t know why I liked it. “Doesn’t have to be, feels like on a cloud.” That’s it. That’s the theme of “Likely Late Summer.” But it doesn’t really sound like a proper song, honestly. But why did I like that? What was I thinking when I pulled that out? I don’t remember anymore. We came too far from that music. So now we are trying to backtrack to that music but I forgot the password. DJ Soulscape When we look at the process of making music, we are trying to capture a moment. A moment that’s evaporating. So there are many random coincidences that factor in. Kim Changwan Oh, so it’s like making liquor. DJ Soulscape We always end with drinking. Kim Changwan We need to have some drinks here. It would be great to have some drinks here, wouldn’t it? [laughter] DJ Soulscape I think we are in a very dangerous territory now. Everyone here, you should be careful. We call drinking with Changwan 9 o’clock drinking. 9 o’clock. There are two meanings. One, that you will be drinking until the 9 AM news. And that if you drink with him and wake up the next day, the 9 PM news is on. Those two. You gotta be careful. Kim Changwan The story got twisted. The original meaning was that, you know, we usually gather for drinks after work around 6 or 7. So when you finish drinking and go home, you can catch the 9 pm news. That’s why we call it 9 o’clock news drinking. Really! DJ Soulscape Oh, so not the next day? Kim Changwan You don’t really know with just one drink. After two drinks you automatically say, “Come on, let’s go home.” Because everything is so tedious and you are getting drunk. So three drinks are a set. After the third, you are already home. Really. Everything is unappealing so you go home and watch the 9 o’clock news and you sleep. DJ Soulscape I think the boss is losing patience so we will move on now. He insisted that I avoid the topic of drinking but it happened. We will now listen to the first half of a Changwan song from ’84. It’s something I play often. Let’s listen til the first verse. (music: Hunyee – “I Don't Want My Sorrow To Be Seen”) While listening to this I really jumped. When I play this at a club, everyone loves it. By the way, you asked her to scream like that, right? Kim Changwan Of course I did. I did. but I didn’t know she would do it so not musically like that. DJ Soulscape But it was you who OK’d it. Kim Changwan Yes, that. DJ Soulscape Yes, because now we kind of joke about it but for me this scream is all I remember about the Korean music from 1984. Because there was no song with a scream like this before and after too. Well, there might be someone like Yunjeong from Pippi Band, but something like that didn’t exist before. Not just the part with the scream but there is a motorcycle sound mixed into it. It’s very different. Or how the synth riff comes on with guitar. People who are listening to this now will have much to discuss about because this is a special tune where synthwave, that is a fusion of synthesizer and new wave is mixed into post-punk. So from what I can tell, it wasn’t made with a certain genre in mind but really just a lot of, “Let’s use this here. Let’s put this sound there.” Kim Changwan If it weren’t would we do that? DJ Soulscape I’m curious. I notice from music back then that there are these kinds of notable sounds that catch my ear. There are a few in the song I’m about to play too. When people think of Sanullim’s music, they think it’s acoustic guitar music. But I disagree completely. You always use these odd sounds that no one else would use. Things that make you go, “You are using this sound?” There were many of those in 1984, ’85. Kim Changwan This was around ’84, ’85. There is something called musique concrète. I was completely filled with the desire to do music with those things instead of using instruments. At the time, I made some music by myself but I lost the tape. [plays bass riff] I can only remember this riff. I remember collecting various ambient sounds around us, like the noise of the Cheonggyecheon and combining them to make music. Even when I was producing Hyunhee’s album I wanted to do them personally. But there was no way. I wanted to add that kind of noise in the end little by little. DJ Soulscape The more I listened the more I discovered subtleties. Like the engine noise and effects like that. This is what you call musique concrète. It’s a type of sampling. Kim Changwan Yes. These days these musical inspirations are concretely expressed and there is equipment that makes it possible. Back then there was nothing. It was a long time before digital. So all the ideas would be only in our minds and it would be difficult to manifest them. I’m sure even back then the people who were doing contemporary music or studying it had tried many different things. But there was no opportunity for regular people to see such performance. So I tried to come up with something using my imagination in that studio. DJ Soulscape That’s what I’m discovering a lot these days. I don’t know if you remember but in the 1989 film, Happiness Does Not Come In Grades, there was this soundtrack. I’m not sure if you guys know, but I played this song on a radio somewhere in Europe. It wasn’t a song but just beats. Here. Listen. It’s about a minute long insert in the movie. (music: Interlude from Happiness Does Not Come In Grades OST) I have heard traces of techniques similar to yours in many places. Like here, the vocal sample is lowered in pitch or where you have added things in an off-rhythm layer. This stuff is not only found in this piece but in many different musical projects you worked on. I found quite a bit of them. So this might be a bit of a guided question but I wanted to ask, back then there existed the concept of this kind of sampling and there were attempts to make music using un-musical sounds but in Korea those probably weren’t accepted as serious music? So when we look at films or this kind of work there is quite a bit of that but like you said earlier, we don’t have tapes or records anymore. It’s a shame. I feel that it would’ve been great to have those. Kim Changwan You are right. We lost the tape. I don’t know what happened to it. This was something only I liked and something only I wanted to do. So it wasn’t a big deal. It’s good to hear it again. But back then it was something I just enjoyed alone. What was that again? The beat. DJ Soulscape Yes, off-beat. Two of them. Like they are being played separately. Kim Changwan I worked on that a lot without others knowing. That is randomly collecting sound and creating a loop using a tape. I made a loop with a tape and then played it backwards. Then you have a new beat. In whatever way. When you play music in a car and you go over a bridge, no matter what music it is, it will synchronize with the curve of the bridge. If it’s a quick song it fits with the changing scenery on the bridge. Whatever beat it is, it will fit. That’s what I experienced. If you listen to a slow song, as you drive, the music fits in with the beat of the bridge. So I thought that the beat is not something that’s created first but it can also occur later. Imagine we are sketching a nude drawing of a woman. We can draw lines along her outline but we can also draw by filling in the background. Same with the beats. Many people have a tendency to add on to the existing beats but we can also discover music from naturally occurring beats. We can make this kind of reversed effort. I had the desire to make music without a central element but what I ended up making was “Motorcycle Guitar Ride.” People were saying, “What kind of lyric is that?” There is a reason to why I wanted to make a song like that at the beginning. I would sing a song that starts like, [strums guitar] “There is a sadness…” Then the audience would listen. But I didn’t want to do that and wrote a song in reverse [strums guitar]. I wouldn’t tell them what kind of song it is [strums guitar]. It doesn’t announce itself as a type. It’s not the kind where I start and the audience would get it. What I’m saying is that I wanted to make music that’s not mine but the audience’s. If the song was logical, the audience would just follow my reasoning. So I got rid of logic. Let’s have the audience fill in the logic. Kind of like the AI today. So if I throw clues at the audience, they can make it theirs. So we ride the motorcycle using a guitar. I don’t know how we can ride a motorcycle using a guitar. But some people will fill in with their imagination. “Oh, this is that.” And, “Oh, how does that singer know that I broke up with a guitarist?” I mean if a woman came to the concert after a breakup, she might think that. I mean, have it as you will but I will not give you clues. So I wanted to avoid making a clear association. I only picked things that didn’t have any association with each other and connected them. That was my intention but I still ended up delivering a single message. It wasn’t supposed to be a uniform message. The message was, “This song is absurd. What kind of song is that?” So that’s how everyone took it. Nowadays when the song comes on people just think that it’s about playing the train game. They just take it as a dance tune. DJ Soulscape But before that too, now that you mention it, I think there were many lyrical attempts like that. Especially the song, “If I Confess, You’ll Be Totally Surprised.” The song’s lyrics are all about the moment. Nothing more or less. It departs from reasoning and sings, “If I confess now you will be surprised. Your eyes will widen. It will be round.” That’s all of it. So I think this was groundbreaking even compared to Sanullim’s previous lyrics. Also sound-wise too. Hold on, let’s listen to the beginning of the song and we’ll talk. (music: Sanullim – “If I Confess, You'll Be Totally Surprised”) Kim Changwan Back then when I sing a song like that, “If I Confess, You’ll Be Totally Surprised,” I was thinking about minimalism mostly. I thought, “I want to sing about shoelaces.” I want to sing about something very simple and just capture a moment. So after that song I repeated minimalism with “Hat and Spaghetti.” That song is just this [strums melody on guitar]. It starts with a drum and a stick. That’s the whole instrument part [strums melody on guitar]. The theme was “I want to see you.” That’s all of it. I wondered how I can express that single desire really strongly. There was a drumstick and you know, the sound of hitting the rim. I wanted to deliver a simple and clear message like that sound. So that’s where that music came from. DJ Soulscape Is there an event that made you pursue this tendency? I can see that clearly from ’85, ’86 and onward, especially the music we listened to, we can hear you trying to get a really minimal sound production using computer programs. Kim Changwan It was a criticism of rock music. I was imagining that rock music could express anything. But globally rock music was in a decline. I love rock and rock is good but I wondered, “What is something that rock can’t deliver?” I thought maybe I was thinking too fancy and rhetorical. I had to lose the rhetorical aspects of rock. So I started work on having that kind of sound and motifs. I wanted to depict a very simple thing. Not something epic or something with a historical rock narrative but an almost obvious truth. In the second album it’s obvious that I wanted to see the raindrops dripping off the awning. If my previous idea of rock was the desire to form a whole garden, through “If I Confess, You’ll Be Totally Surprised” and “Hat and Spaghetti” I wanted to show how now my desire was to watch just one single droplet off an awning. I wanted to show the beauty of that. So I made those musical attempts. DJ Soulscape Because of that I think this is very much in line with very Korean, short narratives used in electronic music. A capturing of a moment. I don’t know if it makes sense but for example, it’s like the early krautrock or Kraftwerk and how they changed the themes of music. Before, the songs would contain a consistent narrative of one’s emotions but now I think it’s a huge change in terms of music. So I wanted to ask you that. At the time these kinds of things weren’t really available in other places. So were there other fellow musicians who were making music with these tendencies? Kim Changwan No. I was always lonely. There was no one like Min Jun around me [laughs]. DJ Soulscape Also one person we can’t forget is Mr. Yeon Seokwon. He is the only person who helped you with the production. Kim Changwan Mr. Yeon Seokwon. Yes, that’s right. DJ Soulscape I want to hear about that time. I remember bringing the Sanullim Space Sound Disco album to you. Oh by the way, I don’t know if you guys know but the album cover was hand drawn by Changwan [holds cover up]. Like the early works, I only learned that after asking him. Kim Changwan This album art took 20, 30 days to do. I went over and drew one butterfly a day. Everyday. I don’t know how many there are total. DJ Soulscape So was it normal for you to draw the album cover yourself? Kim Changwan It became like that. I still draw whenever I get a chance. DJ Soulscape In a way, this is a remix album. This track, “Likely Late Summer,” was remixed by Yeon Seokwon with an interesting sound. I was personally curious how you came to record this album? Kim Changwan This wasn’t something I wanted to do. This is the first thing Seokwon did after returning from his schooling in the US. Back then Seok Won had a lot of interest in stuff like synth-pop so the album was an attempt within that context. We were wondering what it would be like to dress our music up differently. Like an American sound. So we just tried it. I actually have a natural dislike of disco beats and things like that. DJ Soulscape Despite that there is... Before we started talking today I played the song, “Don’t Go.” I first started playing that song about 10 something years ago. But now they are playing it on foreign radio channels. I don’t know if you know this about the song. (music: Sanullim – “Don't Go (86 version)”) Kim Changwan Yes, this is a song that I want to revive. DJ Soulscape Yes. It would be great if you can put it in your show repertoire. Kim Changwan I don’t know. That vocal track is charming. I don’t know if we can get a vocal like that. And now… [singing begins, Kim covers his ears] DJ Soulscape I picked the song but now that I listen to it, the vocal is very sexy. Kim Changwan I’m suffering here [laughs]. DJ Soulscape I think music like this is in a way a re-discovery. Sanullim with a groove. Sanullim with beats. They are not very known. The reason I asked so persistently is because I think your methodology, where you approach your interest in beats and musique concrète with minimalism, and the problems that the pioneers of techno, house and electronic musicians faced both come from the same place. Kim Changwan Yes, they are probably similar. To me this minimal and electronic sound was a rebellion against my rock music so it’s one of the faces of change. DJ Soulscape So that theme is something I really wanted to bring out to discuss. In Korea, especially with electronic music, there was no opportunity to be exposed to that but similar ideas were being born here. That’s a very important topic for us. Acknowledging that there was a rebellion against the patterns, the narratives of rock music and the formulaic Korean songs is very important in understanding Sanullim’s music for our generation. Kim Changwan Yes, you are right. I’m really surprised how you caught the subtext just by listening to the music. DJ Soulscape Probably because we are DJs. On top of the already known songs by Sanullim we hear other things. Like the one-minute long film insert, a short device. We hear that and we think, “Oh, I heard this technique somewhere else.” Someone will catch that and contextualize it. This is one of the biggest reasons why we are gathered here today. We are local musicians who are active in Korea and in Seoul. We have the Internet and we can access various media and all kinds of musical information. So we wonder what it is like when music is formed spontaneously without outside influence. When I look at your past interviews, the kind of pop music that you liked is nothing special. They are almost obvious. It’s not that you listened to anything special. You just listened to something we got on AFKN or the foreign stuff that everyone liked. But what kind of music you emulated is not the point. I would like to ask one more question. You have done a lot of different things, from the early days you have done TV commercials, acting, you have written books not just confined to topics of music. You have done a really wide range of activities. I’m curious how that might have influenced your music? Kim Changwan Well, let’s see… A few of my friends even call me a renaissance man I don’t know. Maybe I have the blood of a nomad. I heard that nomads consider it a shame to stop in the same spot twice. I don’t know how long I will keep leaving from my spot and from myself like a nomad. I don’t know that myself but I’m trying not to always stay in the same spot. I think I’ve blabbed on and on. DJ Soulscape We have a guitar. So maybe we can start taking some questions. If anyone has a question, don’t be shy and tell us. Yes. It would be good to have another microphone. Audience Member Hello. While you were talking about musique concrète, you said you went around collecting sound. Back then there probably wasn’t a field recorder in Korea. Was there something special you would bring to collect sound? Kim Changwan Oh, I just brought something like a cassette tape. Audience Member Really? Kim Changwan Yes. Audience Member So you just connected a microphone to a cassette tape? Kim Changwan Yes. Audience Member Oh, so you just took the recorded sound and edited them to make music? Kim Changwan That’s right. Back then one thing I treasured was the Altec Lansing eight-track mixer. It’s considered a legendary piece of equipment nowadays. It’s black and about this size. Maybe bigger. That and the TEAC eight-channel multi recorder. I did a lot of work with those. It was quarter inch. DJ Soulscape Do you mean the quarter inch reel tape? Kim Changwan Yes DJ Soulscape Now it reminds me. Where a lot of those experimental works you did found? There are a lot of in the TV and films you’ve worked on. Kim Changwan Yes, a few. DJ Soulscape Yes. It would be great to find more I think. Audience Member When you use sounds like that, do you use them thinking, “This sound will be received by the listeners like this?” Or do you just spontaneously decide in that moment as they would fit in the song and its structure? Kim Changwan It’s not written with staffs but instead I pen it like a drawing. And if you do arranging I’m sure you do this, I use my own symbols to do the work. Of course, when I’m creating beats I sometimes rely on coincidences too. And there are intended parts too. Audience Member When you are actually working, what is the ratio between the spontaneous and the non-spontaneous parts? Kim Changwan I don’t know. There isn’t that much, so I relied on coincidence. I edited a tape one time. I took the recording of a dog singing. I calculated how to do the measures with the dog sound and then I calculated what the pitch would be and then made all the notes. I took the tape and converted the distance between notes to the physical length on the tape. I cut them and put them together and made music using the analog method. So stuff like that cannot be done unless you intend it and design it. Audience Member Thank you. Audience Member It’s really an honor to meet you. While listening to your talk I have felt that there was a lot of effort to fight against the world. I felt that in your music. You have expressed it. I’m curious whether you still feel that way? Kim Changwan Yes, of course. But you described it as fighting against the world but really the biggest and constant motivation for me is the sense of wonder. When you feel moved. This miraculous place, this miraculous life, this discomfort. Back then when I was producing one thing I kept saying to my juniors was, “Even when it’s a terrible environment, it’s still an environment.” Right now. There is a sky. There is me. I am looking at the sky. As a habit, we take much of it for granted. It’s a given. But there is nothing that is a given. In a way, everything is for a moment. Each moment to moment, they are all miracles. I’m moved by these moments the same now as I was back then. Only thing I regret is that I left the room I used to be in musically. I mentioned this earlier. I want to go back to the room but maybe I forgot. I can’t imagine the room these days. So I don’t have the right key for the room. “Is this the right key? How about this one?” None of them will open it. So recently, I gave up on trying to return to the room and finding out what the rock spirit of Sanullim was and I decided to go on a journey. So I keep making new songs. Here is a notebook. I sing the Sanullim songs in the book again at home by myself. Then I’m reminded of the nuances and how I wrote these songs but again it doesn’t open the doors. After a while of singing, if feels like I’m listening to a radio. It sounds like songs that I used to listen to I’m no longer the person who wrote them but I’m singing it as if it was a song I heard from somewhere. So I’m now a guest. My songs have become something apart from me. It’s like the lost city of Atlantis to me. It’s like that. Audience Member Thank you. I had a few questions but you answered them all in one go. Kim Changwan Thank you. I was asked whether I’m still writing songs so maybe some of you have heard this recent stuff. [plays the guitar and sings / applause] Everyone thinks about time sooner or later but actually thinking about time itself might be a huge delusion. Same with songs, just considering and approaching a subject. It’s a big task. But we think that we are getting closer to the answer regarding time or thoughts or even ourselves. But I think you would understand if you have driven on a highway tired before. There is that moment when you wake up while driving. You jump in surprise. Realizing how far we are from ourselves is like that moment. We often think that we are in touch with ourselves but surprisingly there is a huge gap. There is no bigger and more foolish delusion than thinking about and discussing time like it’s an object that runs. Time rules over all of us and everything. Even now as I say that as I am putting these words together in my head, time is controlling us. But we delude ourselves thinking about time as something we can objectively perceive. If we expand a bit, space is the same. To experience the space is to pass through a great deal of time. But our senses might be too dull to feel that. Our senses are not sharp enough to allow it. Although there are expressions like, “Music is an art form of time,” that’s only a small part of music. Everything is narrow and everything is concealed. What you need to discover is “what?” That’s it. That, itself. That is letting go of myself and leaving behind the self-image, my sense of aesthetic. Escaping from all that. It’s that kind of attempt. But that is also surprisingly very pleasant. We earlier used the word, fight. That’s how we expressed it. It’s a great struggle too. A titanic struggle. But it’s a great joy too. It’s not an easy task differentiating those. Do you understand? OK. DJ Soulscape Anyone else with a question? Yes. Anything. Normal stuff is fine. Kim Changwan Lack of question is also an answer. Audience Member I’m sorry to ask so many questions. Like the song you just sang and the songs you released as Sanullim, you sing many notes like you are just speaking them. I’m curious what meaning or opinion you have on words you speak in terms of music. Kim Changwan What are words in music? Actually, Sanullim really has no musical base and has no reference. I heard young people say that. References come from musical knowledge. How could we have any references when we were completely ignorant? So if you ask what the music of Sanullim is, I really have nothing to say. So I always used to say that Sanullim is more literature than music. There were many people who commented on our lyrics saying that they were fresh and were new attempts. In truth, that helped bring non-musical elements into the realm of music. So in our perspective, we don’t really want to label it. [strums guitar] One of our songs that encapsulates this well is “If You Hit E-Major.” This song seems very musical but also seems literary but it’s really neither. Very unconstrained. It’s also intended to avoid labelling. I think it contains these ideas well. But even that word, “contains,” is too, really, a bit extreme. It might be more fitting to say that the song doesn’t contain. DJ Soulscape It’s got a frame if it contains. Kim Changwan That’s right. DJ Soulscape What do you think of the musical trait? For example, genre, style, stuff like that. There are many people who do genre-based music. For example, people who like a certain style or form of music. Kim Changwan There is that. Once you have a genre, it can be intoxicating. Once a genre is formed it’s like a hypnosis. If you are infatuated with country music, there is something hypnotic with that. Also other genres like blues can be hypnotic. You can really indulge in that. There is the same with metal. In that sense, it’s a personal choice. I sometimes get the temptation to be hypnotized as well. But every time I get close to falling in I get an urge to leave. So I leave and I leave. Audience Member Do you consciously try to get away from those temptations or is there something that pulls you away from it? Kim Changwan Every time I get that idea, I am reminded of an episode. Did I see it in a movie? A girl in puberty rebels against her father. He says, “Why are you wearing those clothes?” She replies, “What? I do it because I like it.” She talked back like that. So the father says to his daughter, “You are obsessing over that.” He scolds her. “You are obsessing over that.” But I don’t want to obsess over things like music. Once you obsess or fall in love, things become more difficult. Maybe I’m afraid of that. But there are times when I want to fall in. Sometimes I wanna lose myself completely in metal. Yes, hello. Nice to meet you. Audience Member Yes, nice to meet you. I want to ask you a question about the Sanullim song, “A Flower Blooming in the Mist.” I was wondering, that song, is so beautiful and the lyric is so simple, about nature, it’s almost like a fantasy scene about nature. So just wondering when you wrote that song, was it a fantasy about nature or about an experience in nature? And how important do you think nature, forests, mountains, is to musicians, even electronic musicians or band musicians, in your experience? Kim Changwan The environment isn’t important. I don’t have to have any natural environment. I don’t think. You can make it in a small room, it’s enough. All I need is my breath and sunlight. It’s enough. We don’t need big mountain or beautiful river. I don’t think so. OK? Just you and me, one beautiful girl, OK! That’s enough. Small mixer, microphone. That’s all. You can make any, “A Flower Blooming in the Mist.” Audience Member So do you mean like, is this lyric almost symbolic? Not exactly about nature but about the feeling of a natural situation in life? Kim Changwan No. Symbolic. I don’t like to travel. I hate the journey. I don’t want to go overseas. Audience Member How about to the countryside? Kim Changwan The countryside smells. I don’t like it. [laughter] When I go on a tour? I never leave my hotel room. I keep the doors and curtains closed. I just sleep. DJ Soulscape But you walk around searching for Korean cold noodles. Kim Changwan Oh, I go looking for Korean cold noodles. [laughter] DJ Soulscape Yes, anyway. We have a cool city guy, Mr. Kim Changwan today. Thank you for your questions. Is there anyone else? Kim Changwan I don’t really want to go there but I think I can write songs even in jail. Maybe I will write better songs. But please don’t send me there. [laughter] DJ Soulscape Yes, we have been speaking with the eternal traveler Kim Changwan. How do you feel? Kim Changwan I will sing a song praising life. It’s a song praising life but it’s not an upbeat song. Listen. [plays the guitar and sings / applause] DJ Soulscape Thank you. I have asked you, kind of jokingly, to come and just sing us just one song. And to have you actually come and sing, it’s an honor but I feel bad too. It feels like it’s bad manners to just get you to come here and sing. Anyway. Apart from wanting to bring you here today, I was worried. I didn’t want to present you and Sanullim like an artifact in a museum. I’m one of the people who knows you best and I’m a huge fan. I wanted to bring these young 20-, 30-something producers and musicians and have them meet someone with an even more expansive, open and unconstrained outlook. So that they could learn about the nomadic spirit. That’s why I brought you here. I didn’t want to discuss your hit tracks and your band’s history. There were some hard questions too. You have given us a lot of great answers and it’s been great. Did you guys have a great time? Kim Changwan Thank you. DJ Soulscape Also, next time, if we do the 9 o’clock drinking, it’d be great to see all of you there. [laughter] Personally, what I very much want to pursue for the next five or 10 years is to re-discover the music of Sanullim and Kim Changwan through remix projects with Korean producers and musicians associated with Red Bull and RBMA. To do that I have invited Changwan and laid the groundwork. I also asked him to share his ideas on electronic music and musical concepts that overlaps with the kind of music we do so we can discuss that. I’m very thankful. Let’s give a round of applause for Mr. Kim Changwan. [applause] Kim Changwan Thank you everyone. When I was around 15, I went to the Joongang Middle and High School that was in Gahoe-dong. That’s First Gye-dong. From there to city hall I walked after school. I was a sophomore in middle school. As I walked I ran into adults. It was during daytime. I walked and asked every adult I ran into, whoever was walking by, I asked, “Why do you live? Sir, Why do you live?” I kept asking the same question. “Why do you live?” “Excuse me, why do you live?” They all said, “You will know when you grow up,” or, “Why don’t you just go back to studying?” Those were all the answers I got. After that about 20 years later when I became an adult I suddenly remembered that day. I was in my mid 30s. How should I answer that? If a kid like that asked me, I want to give an answer. But it looked like I would answer the same. “Stop thinking useless thoughts and just focus on studying.” I was ashamed of growing up to be like this. So what’s the answer? I really couldn’t find the answer. How should I answer that kid? Then I found an exit. I needed to run away from the kid. If there is a kid like that, best to run. How will I run away? “Life isn’t an opportunity to get answers but it’s an opportunity to ask questions.” That was my exit. So I thought, “That’s what I would say if a kid asks.” But I still haven’t met a kid who asked me that question. But those words are still valid for me. I constantly ask myself, “Why do you live?” To myself. And I try to give an answer but I’m only filled with questions. I really don’t have any answers. And a question that I kept inside from many years ago is, “Why is green, green?” Why is green, green? Why green? Is it the chlorophyll? Why is green, green? I still couldn’t find the answer. I might not find it until I die. Why is green, green? Green. Why is it? Recently I’m thinking, maybe everything is ultimately humanities. Again, even that question is too hard so I cut it down and down and down and down and then it goes to, “Why does everyone look like this? Why do things sound like this?” So the questions are condensed down to that recently. I don’t know yet. I hope you help me find it together. [applause]

Hanin Elias
Hanin Elias was born in Germany and spent part of her childhood in Syria. After her family moved to Berlin, she ran away from home and found her voice in the city’s then bustling punk and hardcore underground, and in 1992 she formed Atari Teenage Riot with fellow Berliners Alec Empire and MC Carl Crack. Fusing punk and techno aesthetics, which they termed digital hardcore, the band expressed anarchist and anti-fascist ideals, attracting controversy as well as industry interest. Using an advance from Phonogram Records, they set up their own Digital Hardcore Recordings, and in 1996 the Beastie Boys’ Grand Royal label licensed their debut album Delete Yourself!, leading to stage dates with the likes of Wu-Tang Clan and Nine Inch Nails. In 1999, Elias left the band and over the next decade focused on solo work and her own label, Fatal Recordings, which championed female and female-identifying artists. She released her first solo album, Get It Back, in 2011, and continues to collaborate with both musicians and filmmakers.
In this public talk as part of the 2018 CTM Festival in Berlin, and held at the Red Bull Music Studios, Elias retraced her steps from punk squats to festival stages and onwards to a lasting independent career.
Hosted by Hanna Bächer Please welcome Hanin Elias. [Applause] Hanin Elias Thank you. Hanna Bächer While we were watching this video, you said, “This was me running up and down dunes for hours.” Which country’s dunes were those? Hanin Elias This was in the Sahara, in Morocco. Actually, I wanted to represent the situation in Syria and Iraq, with the people that are fleeing from ISIS. So, I represented actually a woman that is escaping from this and coming here as a refugee, so I hope that’s clear. Actually I had the idea of sitting on a camel and trying to hit someone with a bow – a terrorist guy – and he will transform into a squirrel. But [laughs] the guys who made the video said it’s maybe it’s too intense and could cause trouble. Hanna Bächer I can totally imagine it now. [Laughter] What is your connection to Syria? Hanin Elias My father is Syrian, from Damascus, and my mother German. I grew up in Syria as well, and went there to kindergarten, as a child. Then my father decided that we’d move to Germany, and then I grew up in Germany with my three brothers. But we always went there to visit family members, so I have a very tight relationship to Syria still. I also went there last year, in April, and the year before, in September, to see what the situation is like, because the media here doesn’t really represent the full picture of what’s happening in Syria. Hanna Bächer These years that you spent as a child in Germany after you came back from Damascus, you spent in West Germany, right? Hanin Elias Yes. Hanna Bächer How was your experience of being a half-Syrian child in Germany? Did people make you feel foreign? Hanin Elias My mom, she’s from Western Germany and that was a very small village that I grew up in, and I was the only one with a foreign name, for example, so people started making fun of my name and pronouncing it in a very ugly way. But I got used to it, and I think what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Hanna Bächer What is your own favorite way of pronouncing your name? Hanin Elias Kha-neen. There are three H in the Arabic language, one is “ha”, the other is kha, and the other is Kha. And mine is the second, Hanin. It means “yearning” and “nostalgia” in Arabic. If English people or German people say Hahhnin, or Hannin, it’s like raping my name [laughs] Hanna Bächer I apologize for introducing you the wrong way. Hanin Elias No, it’s fine. Hanna Bächer Specifically, because I’m called Hanna and then people say Hannah and that also upsets me. Hanin Elias See, we have similar names… Hanna Bächer So, I imagine you as a teenager in smaller West Germany. Hanin Elias No, I was years old when I came to Berlin with my parents. So, only in my childhood I was living Germany. Western Germany. Hanna Bächer That must have been the early ’80’s. When did you first start experiencing Berlin as a cultural city? When did you get in touch with its music scene, then? Hanin Elias That was pretty early because my father always took me to Ku’Damm and I saw punks and I always said to my dad, “I want to look like them,” And he said “No! Don’t!” In the early time, I was also interested in music, especially in the ’80s, when I was ten, 11 years old, I already had an Ideal tape, and I really liked the new wave, Gothic kind of music, which was... And at 15, I ran away from home, because my father started oppressing me, and he wanted me to stay home all the time – because I was becoming a woman, his Arabic roots came out, all of a sudden, and he was treating me differently to my three brothers. Then I started the Riot, and ran away and lived with punks in squats, and made music, because my parents didn’t want to send me money and support my lifestyle. I actually had to beg people at the U-bahn for money, and I always had this thing that I was like, “Hey, can you give me a Deutsche mark, because there’s only one Deutsche mark missing until I can buy myself a ghetto blaster!” So people gave me... “Oh yeah, of course I want to help his girl to get a ghetto blaster.” So, I survived like this. Then I was singing with my tape recorder at the U-Bahn to Madonna’s “Get Into the Groove,” like some kind of strange opera, noisy stuff, singing very loud. Then I got discovered by a friend, Captain Space Sex. He saw me singing at the U-Bahn and he said, “You’re so crazy… Let’s form a band together.” And that was with already my late 15s. Hanna Bächer Late 15s… Hanin Elias Yeah, I was nearly 16. Then we started making music with tape machines and scratching with broken tape recorders, and we didn’t have lots of money so we just improvised with broken electronic devices. It was fun, it was like a psychedelic, breakbeat, noise, guitar thing. Hanna Bächer You’re describing this almost in a joyous way, but was it tough living in squats? Did it scare you? Did it upset you? Or was it overall a time where you felt safe? Hanin Elias No, I felt really free, because my dad was trying to, how do you say, house arrest? I got house arrest all the time, because I did something so my father said, “Oh, now you stay two weeks in the house and you can’t go out with your friends…” So, I always escaped through the cellar and out of my window. I was unstoppable at that time. I really wanted to go out and I wanted to be free, and it felt good to be living in squats, but it was hard sometimes. One day, we slept with eight people in the squat, and it was winter, and there was a toilet outside of the apartment. So, I needed to pee urgently, but I didn’t want to get up, so I peed in an orange juice bottle that was standing next to me and in the morning the girl next to me was like, “Oh my God, I’m so thirsty,” and you can imagine what happened. I didn’t say anything, and she didn’t realize, so until today she doesn’t know what she actually drank. It’s horrible. But we had fun times, we had horrible times, it was weird and… Also I lived in a squat called Rauhaus. Hanna Bächer Where was that? Hanin Elias That was at the Bethanien, it’s called now the Bethanien. My door was broken in, so people could just come in and go up. I couldn’t lock it. So people came, and said, “Hey, have you seen my rat? My rat just escaped,” and stuff like that. That was the late ’80s in Berlin – it was pretty cool, actually. We made music, we lived in squats. But I never dressed really like a punk, I always had a ’70’s kind of dressing style, people always... The punks were also very square, they were like “Oh, look how you look, you look like a secretary or some kind of...” So I never felt 100% punk, because they are also very square. Hanna Bächer So, when the wall came down, you weren’t 18 yet, or you were just about? Hanin Elias Before that, a propos wall, there was the Lenné-Dreieck and we were squatting there. Hanna Bächer What is the Lenné-Dreieck? Hanin Elias Lenné-Dreieck now is the Potsdamer Platz. People were protesting there, and building their own houses, and having tents and everything. We stayed there for weeks, and then the police came. It was right next to the wall back in those days. Now it’s the Potsdamer Platz. You can’t even imagine how it looked, back in the days. And then police came to free the country from us, and we were protesting against the autobahn that was planned there. Then we got sprayed with lots of… Hanna Bächer Tear gas. Hanin Elias Tear gas, and water, it was very strong and horrible. So we climbed over the wall. The East Berlin [officials] welcomed us and gave us cheese bread and coffee and let us out, and towels of course to dry, and then we went back, so we were, actually, as I can recall, the only people who fled over the wall, but into East Berlin. It was crazy times. Hanna Bächer Was that your only contact with the East German police? I mean that sounds like such a unique incident. Hanin Elias It is a unique incident. If you go on YouTube there’s very rare material from VHS still that shows the situation, how people really climbed over the wall into the East and then came out later on – it was really funny. I mean it’s a unique experience to climb over the wall in the other direction. Totally… Hanna Bächer And during all this time, sort of your main creative outlet for yourself was music or were you involved in any sort of performance, dance, making clothes, etc.? Hanin Elias Making clothes? Not so much, no… I always liked to write my lyrics and my thoughts and, back in those days, my English wasn’t that good. But, yeah, I always liked to express myself through music and lyrics very much. Hanna Bächer I’m asking because you just said that you look different, and I think, even for people who have never heard your music or can’t consciously remember your music, a lot of people know your look. And, but that just came... you always had a specific kind of style and just developed it from there? I mean it’s also very… Hanin Elias I think I liked it simple. I like just simple dresses and no chi-chi stuff, because it’s timeless, I think. And I always like the style of the ’40s and ’50s, which I mean it’s not very punk rock, but, I think punk is a state of mind and not a look. Hanna Bächer So, from performing in sort of like open stations, I assume there were venues and squirts as well? What were early venues that you played at? Hanin Elias Early venues would be places like IMA, like after the wall came down there were lots of places in Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg, like… Hanna Bächer IMA was a squat too, right? Hanin Elias IMA was a total squat, yeah. What’s the other name of the places… I have… I can’t even recall the names. Hanna Bächer Long-gone Mitte middle squats... Hanin Elias Exactly. Hanna Bächer Places with no names at all… Hanin Elias I mean, and back in the days we didn’t had internet. There were just flyers made and spread, but the parties were so crowded. And nowadays you have Facebook and all the event pages, and then sometimes it’s so much that you don’t even want to go out, because there’s so much choice and you can’t decide where you go. Then it was all mouth to mouth, and people went into squatted, closed U-Bahn stations and had a party there just with ghetto blasters… Hanna Bächer U-Bahn stations that were closed because of the way that the city geography shifted after the wall came down? Hanin Elias Exactly. Yeah. Hanna Bächer And did you have any possibility back then to record, or was it most that you like... The broken machines... The two of you… Hanin Elias Yeah, we had an 8-track with Captain Space Sex, and we recorded, but it was sounding really bad. I mean there was no mastering or anything. It sounded very low-fi and we also made theater plays. And our band was called . And I was dressed in, like space kind of suits, and we looked like we were from another planet, basically. Very funny look. Hanna Bächer It must have been during that time that you first met Alec Empire, right? Hanin Elias Yeah, I met a friend of him at a dance marathon of Radio4, so I was like dancing to early techno stuff and tried to win the dance marathon, because you could win some money, and I always needed some money back in the day. I thought I could do it and I like to dance. Then this guy just talked to me and said, “Hey. Let’s hang out.” And, through him, I met Alec. And then Alec and me started talking about music and he asked me if I can sing a song with him for his band Die Kinder, which was this old punk band with... And I sang “Identity” with them. That’s how it started, actually, and then we decided to form a band. I mean he said he recruited the band members but it didn’t felt like that for me. So for me it was like, “Okay. We’re going to form a band and let’s see what’s happening.” And then it was him and me and we also played at the Tekknozid festivals, we had several projects... Hanna Bächer People who don’t know the Tekknozid festivals… Hanin Elias Tekknozid festival was one of the first techno festivals. Like Tanith and people like that – we really admired his hard style of DJing techno stuff, and also we like breakbeats, and we had this performance at Tekknozid instrumental mostly, and we had the music developed. First we had breakbeats with him playing the Gibson guitar and me singing whatever came into my mind. Then it developed slowly that we had a strategy, and we wanted to become political with the music that we did. Hanna Bächer This urge to become political was one… I mean it sounds like you had been political in the years before, as well. Was there anything specific that happened that triggered you and Alec saying, “We’re going to be political in our music”? Hanin Elias Yeah, we saw after the wall came down it was not only fun and love and peace and unity. I mean the new unity that developed was like a German unity. Then, all of a sudden, the new scapegoat was foreigners and people who were in refugee camps, and these camps were all of a sudden set on fire, and you heard more and more of these stories that people were set on fire... Refugees, and so that was a negative aspect of the German unity. And, I always was political and that I really didn’t just want to make music for fun, because I always had this mission inside of me that I want to change things. And, so, yeah. I ran away from my Dad and told him, “F--- you.” I mean, now we get along very well. He accepts me the way I am, sorry Daddy. I was always like against something. I had this very strong feeling of justice and wanted to make things right. Hanna Bächer There was at the same time a kind of scene going on in Berlin that was not so much about conflict, but about unity and love, etc. The early years of the Love Parade, or maybe the early years were more angry, so were you opposed to that… Hanin Elias Not at the beginning. At the beginning it was a cool energy, but I always thought, but it’s so boring. There are not really vocals in there. There is not really a message in there. It just feels like everyone’s doing the same marching thing, and tries to forget all the stress at work, and just letting go of things, and it was empty after a while. So, I thought “Hey, why not,” and Alec, of course, too… We were like, “OK, let’s have lyrics. Let’s have a message and use the same equipment, but make if more dirty and not as clean,” because the direction was more and more getting the sound very clear and very clean. The nice thing about the beginning of the techno era was the dirtiness. The dirtiness of the places, you know, some of it was dripping from the roofs. We were all standing in water, but because of the dancing you felt warm and, you know, it was kind of rotten and that energy was very cool and punk rock. So… Hanna Bächer We should maybe… Hanin Elias Yeah. Play something. (video: Atari Teenage Riot – “Kids Are United”) Hanna Bächer You had a lot of fun. Hanin Elias Yeah, we did. And this was actually filmed in the club that we owned. It was the Suicide Club. Hanna Bächer Wait. You owned Suicide? Hanin Elias With a friend, yeah, Roland Braun, back in the days, yeah. And Ralf Brendeler. Ralf Brendeler took over the club later on and turned it into Suicide Circus and he has now this techno club. But in the beginning it was our club, and we had the Bass Terror parties, and we wanted to have all, like DHR [Digital Hardcore Recordings] sounds there. And yeah, it was cool. So yeah, as you can see, we used guitars, which pissed off the techno scene. And the whole crossover thing wasn’t very welcome in Germany. And also the messages. So, there was a divide. We liked some of the stuff they did, but they were like totally conformist about their music. People in the States were very open minded, and so we were more successful overseas than actually in Germany and Berlin. Hanna Bächer Because as this video says, that was already, when you were already signed to Grand Royal… Hanin Elias Oh, that was, was it? Hanna Bächer Well, I think it’s how the video was sort of tagged, but maybe the recording was before that. But what happened is that you got signed by a really big label in the US. How did the years before that unfold? So, from you meeting Alec Empire, and then him recruiting you… Hanin Elias Recruiting me, exactly. Hanna Bächer The band! Hanin Elias Yeah. So we started making this kind of stuff with guitar samples, and then we had Carl. Carl was there already as well. Hanna Bächer Carl Crack? Your co-frontman. Hanin Elias Carl Crack, yeah, our MC. And yeah, we had shows in Berlin and in German clubs, very underground. And then a friend of ours, Philipp Virus, who also made this video and most of our videos, had a sister who was with an American guy. And she was in the music scene, and she’s now married to J Mascis from Dinosaur Jr. And so the Beastie Boys discovered us through her and through Philipp. So, and they wanted to sign us. And then we toured in the States and had success over there. Hanna Bächer And in Japan? Hanin Elias And Japan, and we toured the Big Day Out, and we toured with Wu Tang Clan, Rage Against the Machine, people like that. That was fun times. Hanna Bächer I mean, what you said earlier, the political angle that you had or the political message that was a lot about how Germany evolved, or the problems that occurred in Germany after the reunification. How did you feel like that translated to an international audience? Hanin Elias I don’t know. I mean, we had lots of lyrics that are about starting a riot and anti-government, and also “Death of a President (D.I.Y.)” and if you listen to the lyrics now, it’s like prophetic. Everything that we were singing about, the whole terror thing wasn’t happening back in the days. That was in the ’90s. But it’s happening now, it all came true. So it’s kind of… We foresaw the future in a way, and lots of people didn’t only project it on the German cause, because it was happening globally and worldwide. The dangers were all there for people to see. I mean, there wasn’t the possibility to check everything on the internet like nowadays, but yeah, if you would have your sensors out, you could already feel that it was going into a direction of yeah, monopolies and lobbying and bankers taking over. Politicians trying to have the economy stoked up at the cost of foreign countries and stuff like that. So, millions of people were protesting against the Iraq War, but it didn’t change anything. So that was like panicking us, you know… We wanted to speak to the people and wake them up. And we also used the right frequencies for that, because mostly people get very… “Relax, watch TV, don’t worry.” Everything was like that. And our frequencies were like, “WAKE UP!” Like in this film Network, you know? Have you seen it? It’s a cool film from the ’70s. You should all watch it. Hanna Bächer Alright, everyone, cool film from the ’70s. Hanin Elias It is. Hanna Bächer Watch it. Hanin Elias Network. Hanna Bächer I haven’t seen it, unfortunately. So, you had a vision of more justice and equality for the world. But how... Hanin Elias Yeah, but also to get the people away from this passiveness. Hanna Bächer Yeah. Hanin Elias Yeah. Hanna Bächer How much justice and equality was in Atari Teenage Riot? Hanin Elias Yeah, well... It started very well. And then after a while, yeah, it didn’t feel like an equal band situation anymore. So, I decided to leave and do my own thing after Carl Crack committed suicide. And he committed suicide a few weeks before September 11 happened. Yeah. And that was the end of an era. Hanna Bächer And at this point it had been you, Alec, Carl, and Nic Endo in the band? Hanin Elias And Nic Endo, exactly. She joined later and took over the singing part now. Hanna Bächer But you did not leave because of Carl’s death, you left because this… Hanin Elias Oh, that was one, that was one reason why I left. Because I thought, “It’s not going to be the same anymore.” But, also, there were tensions, you know? I was pregnant twice during the whole Atari thing, so I was mostly in the tour bus with a big belly and in most of the video clips of Atari I was pregnant. I had my two kids who are now 20 and 17 while I was with Atari Teenage Riot. And you can imagine that it was very exhausting as well to always jump and scream and, I mean, it’s great but… I remember we were on tour with Nine Inch Nails, and Trent Reznor told me, “Hey, Hanin, I know you are in the seventh month now, why don’t you give birth to your child at my house and then we can continue the tour?” I’m like, “Alright. What are you talking about?” And I knew that he had this... His, the door was from the Charles Manson massacre when they killed Sharon Tate. And he bought this door at an auction and had it built into his house, so I was like, “Hmm, no, maybe it’s not a good omen.” You know, who knows what this guy... You know. You never know. People are crazy. And so I decided not to do it, which was a good idea, because it was a very difficult birth. And yeah, it was always like that. People seemed to ignore that I need special treatment in a way, you know. And it wasn’t appreciated that I was pregnant, and also I got discriminated against – “Oh, yeah, you’re getting fatter and fatter, it’s not so cool,” you know, so I felt like, “Shit, it feels like I’m in this commercial band that I never wanted to be in,” and guys just treated me just like, I guess, Kylie Minogue is getting treated from her label. People, when they tell, “Oh now you need to change your look, you can’t go on like this.” So it was kind of the same. And yeah, I didn’t feel good any more. And, also I had signed some contracts in a hurry that actually made sure that I wasn’t a part of the band any more, and that Alec was the only one that was deciding what’s happening. So, it didn’t feel like a democracy or something at all. And yeah, I decided to leave. Hanna Bächer So there’s no GEMA millions that are pouring in each time someone plays “Deutschland Has Gotta Die”? Hanin Elias No! Not at all. Hanna Bächer You get ten cents? Hanin Elias Something like that. Not even ten cents. Hanna Bächer But did you co-own Digital Hardcore Recordings, DHR, the label? Hanin Elias No, I had a sub-label. I had a sub-label for Atari recordings, but I didn’t own it. So later on, I re-formed the label, outside of DHR and called it Fatal Recordings. Hanna Bächer Let’s maybe listen to a track, Future Noir, which is your record that came out in 2004, after that was already… Hanin Elias My solo stuff, yeah. (music: Hanin Elias – “Future Noir”) Hanin Elias [Speaking German] Hanna Bächer Should we switch back to English? Hanin Elias Okay, sorry. You chose a very sad song of mine, but that was really a phase of my life when I was really down. I found this guy TweakerRay who came and jumped on stage when I was playing in Hamburg, for my solo stuff. Then later on, we talked and he played me his demo tape. And I found his music so beautiful that I asked him, “Hey, don’t you want to produce my next album? And we can sit together and write songs together...” And we did. With him, I produced Future Noir album… Hanna Bächer That song also had Thurston Moore on guitar, right? Hanin Elias Exactly, Thurston Moore I met also through Philip Virus’s sister, and I went to Amherst, where J Mascis and Thurston Moore lived as neighbors. I hung out with J. Mascis and Thurston Moore, and we jammed. That’s how the Thurston Moore guitar came onto the song. Hanna Bächer And this came out on your own label… Hanin Elias Yes... Hanna Bächer On Fatal… Hanin Elias Yes… Hanna Bächer where you were only releasing female-identifying artists. Hanin Elias Yeah, or guys who identified with female people, being what they are. Hanna Bächer Allies. Hanin Elias Exactly, because at first I thought only female musicians were doing electronic music their way, and not as dogmatic as the guys, talking about equipment all the time, and being very important. I formed this label, Fatal Recordings, and I had great bands. Girls were just sending me tons of stuff. Very different, crazy sounds, and lots of energy. It was very inspirational. But it wasn’t a commercial success at the end. The Future Noir album was the most important album for me to break free from DHR, and from the bondage contract, and this song actually represents that I was actually put on ice, because I couldn’t find another label, and because I was still under contract with them, which was prolonged for longer even. I could only get it out through my own label. Hanna Bächer How did you survive these years in a financial way after Atari? Hanin Elias I had a husband, luckily, who was selling architectural antiques. He also had his own business. He was collecting furniture after the wall came down. People threw stuff out and put it in front of their houses, and he just collected everything. And by now, he’s one of the most important collectors from these architectural antiques, like old tiles and doors and stuff like that. Even people like George Clooney and Tom Cruise go to him when they make a film in Germany, to get these old, original architectural antiques. Hanna Bächer But you were also involved in running a gallery, is that right? Hanin Elias Yes, Gallery Elias. We had special pieces from the architectural antiques that were too good to just sell them off and [my husband] had an old pig farm that he transformed into a warehouse for his stuff, then we had this gallery. Hanna Bächer How did you like to be in that scene, in the art world, compared to your teenage years in squats? Hanin Elias It wasn’t really a scene of art lovers, it was more a scene of people who like nostalgic stuff, because it was these old rotten things, and it had more to do with my time as a new-wave goth. It was like these beautiful graveyard figures, for example, and I could totally identify with these nostalgic pieces. I love that. Hanna Bächer Fatal Recordings, being this mostly-female-artist label, and you having had given birth in the ’90s as a musician… Were there many women you could talk to about this experience? Hanin Elias No… Hanna Bächer In Germany? Hanin Elias I was only 24 when I had my son, and everyone else was too busy with themselves, and they weren’t interested in kids. I didn’t really have friends, especially from the music scene, who could identify with that. Hanna Bächer It feels like there’s quite some, specifically from Berlin, groups of women who are only releasing music by female artists, or who are from networks such as Female Pressure. And I’m talking about labels such as Monika. Were you in touch with them at all? Hanin Elias No, not really. That came later that they were interested. And I think I’m also on a compellation on Female Pressure, but not really directly in contact. We had our own scene, and it was an international scene. Bands like Phallus Über Alles, Kunst, Lolita Storm, people from all over the world actually sent us stuff, and we organized a concert for them to play. Jessie Evans, for example, she moved to Berlin because of that. We had our own scene. Hanna Bächer And in this scene, there were quite, at least to me it always felt like there were a few younger musicians who did their thing, knowing that someone like you had done things before, such as Gina D’Orio, for example… Hanin Elias Yeah, yeah… Hanna Bächer Who must have been a friend at that time? Hanin Elias Yes, we were touring together. We were in the tour bus all the time, making jokes and fun. Gina and Patrick had this band EC8OR, so they were on DHR. It’s cool. Hanna Bächer After you did the gallery, and then you did the Future Noir album, your life moved away from music, but also geographically away from Europe, right? What happened? Hanin Elias In this gallery, I sold this Pan, like a nature god of bronze. I had some money to take a trip to French Polynesia, which I always wanted to see, because I read this book about kahuna magic and some weird stuff, so I got interested in French Polynesia. I flew there alone, left the kids and my husband, landed on this island, this beautiful island, , and when I landed I though, “Oh my God, this is my home.” I felt like I’m at a place where I can totally relate to. It was humid. It was sensual. The colors were like… All of a sudden, somebody had switched on technicolor in my life of gray Berlin sky. The sea was so amazingly turquoise and blue, and shades of green and gold. It was so beautiful. In the last week of my stay there, I fell in love with some fisherman on the island. Then when I came back to Berlin, I told my husband, “I’m so sorry, but I totally fell in love and I think I have to, after 11 years of marriage, have to go there and live there.” But he was very cool about it. He said, “Thank you for the 11 years you spent with me.” He was also open minded and we’re still like best friends. I mean, so I took the kids to the island and moved there with that fisherman, who was also a policeman on the island. They had only like five policemen on the island from the Tahitian Police and they had these sexy uniforms, like short pants and then the tattoo would stick out. They didn’t have guns or anything. The Tahitian policeman were only responsible for the Tahitian people, because they hate the French, the Gendarmes. So, they didn’t want to have any business with them. If there is something happening in French Polynesia, like family arguing or whatever, then only the Polynesian police goes then to takes care of it. So, I moved in with him. He had a self-built house of little… It was fun. Living in this improvised house. You couldn’t lock the doors and we had a chicken in the cupboard, like laying eggs. So every morning, you could look, “OK, we have some fresh eggs. The chicken was there.” Was so cute. Yeah. For me, it was really nice because I always lived in this aggressive kind of environment, like always being against things. Hanna Bächer Yeah. We have quite a few videos of you screaming, “Fuck the police.” Hanin Elias Yeah. Hanna Bächer On trucks. Hanin Elias I was so angry, so anti… And I think it was very soothing and calming. It totally changed me to live on the island and to have this relaxed lifestyle. It was also important for the kids. I mean, the kids were kind of hyperactive a little bit, because they are city kids. And they always need entertainment and GameBoy, and everything. After a while, we didn’t have any television whenever it was raining, and then the kids just calmed down. They were becoming more happy with having a plastic bag and sliding down the mud hills and playing with marbles and going fishing. It totally turned them into very patient, quiet, calm, nice human beings. Which they still profit from, now that they’re back in Berlin. Yeah. It was a big change of life, and I went fishing with a spear gun and hunting for my breakfast, planting vanilla and papaya and uru. You know uru, it’s the breadfruit that caused the mutiny on the Bounty back in the days? And that’s very delicious stuff too. Yeah. And I love Polynesian people. They have this kind of like rudeness… Very honest. They look at you, but they really, really look at you. So, I learned French there, and this guy I was with only spoke Tahitian and a little bit of French. So, in the beginning, it was like a Tarzan and Jane situation. But it was great. After five years, I came back and that was a very horrible time, because I had to start from zero again. But yeah. Hanna Bächer But your journey kind of went through at least in a creative way through Latin America and so, I think… Hanin Elias Yes. Hanna Bächer Chile, specifically, and Argentina… Because when you were living in French Polynesia, you were collaborating with lots of Latin American artists. Hanin Elias So, I had some fans in Chile who listened to our music when they were 12. Now they were older and they were like, “Hanin, you can’t stop making music. You’re on this island now – is everything over? You have to continue making music. Please don’t stop. Please come to Chile, we’ll send you a ticket and organize a tour for you.” And I’m like, “What? OK.” So, I decided to go to Chile, play some shows and also record some tracks with this guy, Diego Sagredo. He organized also some other trips like gigs in Argentina and Brazil and Peru. That was cool. So I started making music again and made some songs for the Get it Back album. Hanna Bächer Should we listen to “Get It Back,” maybe – the track. (music: Hanin Elias – “Get It Back”) Hanin Elias “Get It Back,” that’s a song I made with Marcel Zürcher… Hanna Bächer Your partner in Fantome… Hanin Elias Exactly. So, with Marcel – who was, first, my drummer, then my guitarist for the live stuff – I made this track which also, yeah… It’s a collaboration. I love collaborations, because then other people give other ideas, and he comes from an industrial background. You don’t hear that in the stuff we make together, not at all, I think. Hanna Bächer This is sort of picking up where you left a bit with Atari… Hanin Elias Some songs, yeah. The influence is there, but it’s more danceable, this kind of like hip-hop direction. But I’m not a hip-hopper, so something else came out of it. Hanna Bächer But where do you nowadays find the anger to perform such lyrics? Or is a very different kind of anger than- Hanin Elias I mean, I’m angry every day when I look at what’s happening in the political world and that’s where I always got my anger from. I think I got this from my father. He was always watching TV and shouting at the television. And I always found that very annoying, but now I took over the part. It’s horrible, what’s happening politically. The foreign politics of the US and the western countries and the NATO countries are just like… You can’t just be calm or you’re… You’ve had too much Kool-Aid if you’re calm, which I didn’t. Hanna Bächer You made an anthem for Syria called “Kraken?” Hanin Elias Yeah. Hanna Bächer And you’re also involved in a film called Kraken, which is going to come out sort of in a few months. Kind of soon by a guy called Christopher Kanal. I still don’t really understand how the anthem for Syria that you made is related to this movie filmed in Iceland. Hanin Elias Yeah. Hanna Bächer Of the same name. Hanin Elias The movie was filmed in Iceland and Christopher Kanal asked me to make film music, before he asked me to play a role in the movie. So, Romain and me, Romain Frequency, we’re also known as Electrosexual, we make the song but when I was making the song and we knew it’s for the film, I also thought this melancholic vibe also represents my sadness for Syria. So, it’s kind of like a double song. It fits very well with the Kraken film. Has this icy feeling of elves, but on the other side it’s also this melancholic feeling I have when I think of Syria, the Syria from my childhood. So, why not use it in a double sense? Hanna Bächer All right. We’re going to listen to a minute of your “Kraken” anthem for Syria and then if there are any questions in the room, please feel free to ask… (music: Hanin Elias feat. Electrosexual – “Kraken (Anthem for Syria)”) Hanna Bächer So this is “Kraken,” out on your newest EP, right? Hanin Elias Yes, a whole new EP. And there’s also a song, the main song of the EP, “Hold Me.” In the video, a guy who I met while shooting the film Kraken in Iceland and he made camera for this film and he offered me to make a video. And because Tomas Lemarquis, the actor who also played in Blade Runner and X-Men and Icebreaker owed him something, he plays in my video and runs around naked in the snow, which was really funny, I think, and cool. Hanna Bächer I suggest we watch that video in the very end, before that piece if there are any questions. Hanin Elias Oh yeah, ask me. Please, don’t be shy. Ask me anything. Hanna Bächer You said earlier, you went back to Syria after 18 years, right? And have dabbled a bit in journalism so you’ve interviewed a few people. Hanin Elias Yes, it was a spontaneous thing actually that I started interviewing people with my phone, and because I wanted to. It was very media thing about Syrian people in Aleppo and Aleppo was burning, so I have family in Aleppo. They always told me different stories and they lived in west Aleppo, so it’s what people here would call the government-held area, or the regime area. My family is from the Christian minority. They live in west Aleppo and they always got targeted by mortar shells and other shellings. They saw people dying every day, but nobody ever reported about them. I went there I talked to people, I even offered to go on a talk show to talk about the other side of the story, which is actually the bigger part of the population, who lives in the other areas. Since Aleppo now is liberated, as I say it, because now 800,000 people came back to that area in east Aleppo where everybody here was reporting that “Aleppo was burning,” and stuff like that, but now people are coming back, but nobody reports about that. It’s a very difficult situation and I wanted to go there to see for myself, because I didn’t see anyone in the media reporting about this properly and it was very biased and one-sided. Of course that’s a geopolitical move, and I don’t support that.

Jan Delay
Throughout a career that began more than 25 years ago, Jan Delay has kept his hometown of Hamburg close. From his beginnings as a would-be hip-hop entrepreneur and budding rapper to his current status as a fixture of the German pop landscape, Delay has remained honest, approachable and straightforward, much like his city. Best known to a certain generation as one of the artists who helped amplify Germany’s rap boom, he has since proved adept at reinvention while retaining the DIY flair of his early years surrounded by punk and hip-hop dreamers.
In this public conversation as part of the Red Bull Music Academy 20th Anniversary tour in Germany, Delay retraced the steps that took him from the bedroom to the stage alongside the Absolute Beginners and onwards into reggae, funk and pop.
Hosted by Davide Bortot My name is Davide. I have the pleasure of welcoming you here in the name of the Red Bull Music Academy. The Red Bull Music Academy has been around for exactly 20 years today. It all began in a warehouse in Berlin Friedrichshain. Which was quite different at the time. Very different. Some warehouses actually carried merchandise back then. But in this one there were musicians from all over the world. Thirty of them. They came together to make music and to talk about music. To exchange ideas. And that was really the whole idea of the Red Bull Music Academy from the start. To bring musicians of different genres and cultures together and to inspire them. And the idea was always to celebrate the music we all love. I’m assuming you all love it too, otherwise you wouldn’t be here. And that is exactly what we want to do today. A lot has happened in 20 years. But one idea has always stayed the same. It was always about the music and people that really made a difference. In certain genres, in their cultures and in their scene. And we have invited someone like that today. He internalized the vibe of this city and then shaped it like few others have. He is the founder of important institutions like International Music Entertainment, LMS - Last Man Standing, or La Boom, for example,
or Hype Magazine. And several other institutions we will talk about in a moment. So please give a very warm welcome to Eizi Eiz, Jan Delay. [Jan Delay steps on stage] Athletic. Not bad. Jan Delay Hello. Davide Bortot It’s good to have you here. I was just joking about important institutions like International Music Entertainment. What is International Music Entertainment? Jan Delay That was my first attempt to do something when I was 13. Something that had to do with hip-hop and where I could maybe make a buck or two. We came up with a tape music copy service. We were still working with a typewriter. Basically we came up with an analog version of Napster. We listed hip-hop albums that you could order from us for a German mark. And then we would transfer them to tape. And we had one client. And he never received his order. Davide Bortot When you say “we” who do you mean? Jan Delay That was the legendary Farbinger, Fab 5 Finger, Torch’s cousin whom I met playing basketball when I was 12. He was also the reason I was one of the lucky few who had the chance to listen to great German rap for the first time, listening to the demo of Advanced Chemistry. Davide Bortot Where did this desire come from? When you’re 13 you’re usually doing this and that. Playing football... Jan Delay Basketball. Basketball. Yeah, Football was totally lame then. Davide Bortot But where did this desire come from? Where did the love for hip-hop and its culture came from that made you want to be involved and get something started? Jan Delay That’s difficult, I’m not sure. It just takes a hold of you when you’re at this age, when you are so susceptible to be influenced for the rest of your life. And where you’re full of energy and the desire to do something. When you discover something then it really takes a hold of you, when you realize it’s not just Public Enemy and LL Cool J, but that graffiti, as an art form, is part of it, and that there is a dance that is part of it. And that people are doing it all by themselves, bringing out their own records. And that it’s all real. Then it kind of knocks you off your feet. And you realize you can do this too. Without piano or guitar lessons. You can just go for it. And that’s how you start with stuff like International Music Entertainment. So you learn from your flops and we went on to start a magazine. And through the family connections of Torch we were able to interview people. Being only 13 years old we changed our voices on the phone. We weren’t allowed to go to any jams at 13. We were like, “Yes, hello.” Trying to make our voices sound deeper and older while interviewing hip-hop people. But you just do all that. And eventually you get something back. And then you are 14 or 15 and you are allowed to go to the jams. And then you realize, it’s all already there. This is gonna sound old, but of course there were no cellphones and no internet. Which means it had to spread in a different way. And you were aware of much less that was going on that you could learn and grow from and you could exchange much less with other people. But when you went to these jams you said, “Wow. Something like this is going on in all the big cities. And they are on a similar level as us, or even higher.” And you exchange thoughts, it’s just the best. And it was very intense and full of energy and it just hits you and you can’t shake it off anymore. Davide Bortot This combination of different elements. This idea of doing things yourself. What defined hip-hop back then and still does? Do you remember when you first became aware of this and understood it? Was there a moment when you understood, “This is what hip-hop is made of?” Jan Delay I think in the beginning you’re just thinking, “Wow!” These heavy beats and how cool everyone is and what awesome sneakers they’re wearing. And that’s the music and how it gets you. That was when I was ten. And when I was 12 I saw Beatstreet. It aired on GDR 1, so the GDR introduced me to the real hip-hop, the real hip-hop culture. And we taped it. Casper did, Tropf. So you could watch it again and again. There were already some pieces around, but you hadn’t made the connection yet, that it was part of the music. Even if you thought it was cool on its own. And in Beatstreet you see what it means, how it fits together and where it comes from. That was like an awakening. And I think we went outside right after watching Beatstreet and sprayed our first piece. With cans from the appliance store. No, even worse. From the drug store. Davide Bortot Stolen? Jan Delay No, of course not. No, no. Later we stole them. But the photos were all stolen. But I think we really paid for those first ones. Like 7.95 Deutschmarks. Davide Bortot You mentioned Tropf. Later there was a whole group of people, you were a big part of bringing these people into the limelight, who you are still working with today. Tropf is still mixing your concerts. And he co-produces your records. Jan Delay I make records with him and we share a studio. Davide Bortot You had already met the people you would later form a band with. How did you meet them? How did you meet Denyo? How did you meet Samy Deluxe? Jan Delay OK, I’ll try to break it down. Dennis, Sam and I all come from the same zip code and a radius of 200 meters in Eppendorf. I’m from Heinstreet. You are from here so you know. The people on the internet don’t, they’re out of luck. I could see down into Sam’s apartment from mine. It was on the side street. And Dennis was living on the next crossroad behind me. And I met Dennis on my school yard. On the corner where you could play basketball. We were 12 or 13. Later I switched to his school. But I already knew him then. Sam was always around, we grew up together. I knew his face. But then one day I saw him from my balcony listening to his Walkman and walking down the street like this. So I knew he listened to rap too. You could see it from his clothes too. Every school had three to five people who listened to hip-hop back then and you could tell from the clothes. So I saw him walking around. And then during one our first jams, in Itzehoe I think, I mean one of our first perfomances in a jam, I saw him in the first or second row. And then we started talking when we ran into each other on the street. Through Jochen, DJ Dynamite, whom I knew from basketball. He played for Billstedt and Fabi and I for BCJ. I got more of a connection with him because he started the band No Nonsense, that later became Dynamite Deluxe. Tropf I knew since I was 11 or 12 from school. And then the three of us became sort of a group together. And I managed Dynamite Deluxe in the early days. From the point on when they weren’t called No Nonsense anymore. Until I made Bambule, then it all became a bit much. I’m not a manager, I’m a musician. So others continued that. We founded Eimsbush [label] together and I released their demo. So eventually more people kept coming together, either through the hip-hop connection or through school. Davide Bortot But before all this started. You grew up in a household where music was a big deal. Jan Delay Yes. The three of us are from the 250 meter radius, from the heart of Eppendorf. But all from parents who had nothing to do with Eppendorf. We had no money. I don’t want to whine about it, but it affects you. The two of them even more so because of the colour of their skin. Going to school as an unusual person in Eppendorf around all those people who had so much money, it motivates you. Maybe you are a little more ambitious as if you had grown up among equals. And if you add the identification with hip-hop, because those people were all broke too, then it goes “click” all the more. Davide Bortot Now I have to talk like a grandfather. Today it’s hard to imagine that hip-hop was something subversive. Today it’s just the pop music people or young people are listening to. What did the others listen to back then? And did they make fun of you for the music or the clothes? Jan Delay Well.. I don’t know. Probably. But you didn’t take those people seriously, for what they were or what they represented. As someone from Hamburg, especially as a hip-hopper you have a certain confidence. Or what others might consider to be arrogance.
Which isn’t the case at all. But you are so full of energy, so convinced at that point that if someone comes along and calls you out, you don’t really care. Whoever it is, is making a fool of himself and it doesn’t bother you. It’s just how things are. You were just proud of what you represented. Of being an outsider, a freak. But still very confident of yourself and really into what you are doing. So it was always cool. So I’m not carrying any grudges I could talk about. Davide Bortot You just talked about your first piece, or how you went out to spray for the first time. Do you remember the first time you made music? Or whatever you considered music back then? Jan Delay Music or rap? Davide Bortot Both. Music. Jan Delay I was always around music. My dad made music and not being allowed to go to one of his shows was the worst thing ever. Because I had to go to bed. So it was always around me. I was lucky that my parents had an amazing record collection and amazing taste. So it was always there. And the first thing I discovered and bought for myself was Udo Lindenberg. Because I only knew music in English or with no lyrics. So I didn’t understand anything. And the German stuff I knew was like German folk music. And then Udo came along. And he spoke to me. He made great music, it had a groove. Which was the most important thing to me. And he had something special. And he spoke to me in German like a normal person would talk. He said things like, “Shit.” As a six year old I thought that was great. So that was the first record I bought. I loved Nena too. But I think I just had a crush on her. And then Prince came. Pop music in general. I always listened to the charts and recorded them and tried to sell the tapes. No, just kidding. Madonna was the greatest thing in the third grade. And at the same time I started making some music of my own. I got a bass drum and an old snare drum and I built a drum set out of them. I found out much later, like ten years ago that they were actually from Udo. Because where I come from, Eppendorf, there was a bar called Uncle Pö and Udo basically grew up there. And the sister of a friend of my mother was dating Udo. And at some point the drums became outdated, he was drummer too, so I got his drum set without knowing it had been his. But it was some kind of a full circle. Anyway, I was drumming around to Madonna. Then Prince came at the same time. As God. That was about it as far as music goes. And then hip-hop finally arrived, with Run D.M.C. I heard “Walk This Way” on the radio in France. And from then on all that other music was kind of forgotten. Because I was so into hip-hop. Davide Bortot You were supposed to be the DJ of the Beginners originally? Jan Delay Yes. Because Dennis and Martin were rapping in English. And I thought that was cool. And it didn’t even sound that embarrassing. But I knew if I did it would be terrible and I didn’t want to. I don’t think in English, I don’t dream in English and I don’t talk English. When you rap it should be honest. And you should be able to say what you want to say. And I said, “Let’s do it in German.” I knew they were doing it in France with IAM and NTM in French. I knew through our magazine that that was happening. That it was possible. So I tried to convince them. But they didn’t want to, because they thought it would be embarrassing. And then I had this demo from Advanced Chemistry, with a freestyle on it. Just a drum computer beat and everybody did a few lines. “Heidelberg” was on it and another song. And they heard it and loved it. So we decided to do it in German. At that point I thought I would be the DJ and make beats. My father was a musician and part of a band. He and a colleague had bought the first affordable sampler. I don’t want to get too nerdy. But MIDI came out at some point. A computer that controls your keyboard and is capable of producing drums. But this sampler didn’t have MIDI yet. So you had to play the loops one by one with your fingers and then copy it to tape. And copy it again. So it was a lot of work. But it was also fun and it was what I wanted to do. Make beats and scratch a little. With like a coin taped to the needle. Davide Bortot You made a demo, as you did back then. You couldn’t upload it to Soundcloud as you would today. You had to distribute it among people more directly. What did you have to do to get it out there? Jan Delay We didn’t do anything, because somehow we thought that it really wasn’t that good.
But we had great intensity. Especially live. And somehow that came across even in this terrible demo. A friend of ours was doing an internship at Groove City. Still the number one hip-hop record store in Hamburg. Applause! It’s still around today. Ale Dumbsky, drummer of Die Goldene Zitronen, was there. They had just made a little money with a tape copy service. No, with a record Kampfstern Mallorca dockt an and “Der Tag, an dem Thomas Anders starb.” He formed a label with the money and he still lived in a squat at Buttstreet and he was really into hip-hop. And he thought this was the next big thing. Not in the sense that you can make money with it. But in the sense that this was going to be what punk rock had once been or wanted to be. Everyone is doing it themselves. And they can unleash their energy and do something great with it. He wanted to make a German rap compilation. Kill the nation with a groove. The first German rap compilation was called Krauts With Attitude. It had the German colors on the cover. It was terrible. Even worse for him as a punk rocker. So he wanted to take it in a different direction And we as poster boys were perfect for that. With our song “Keine,” a song against the police. Anyway, our buddy started talking to him at the record store and he listened to the demo. So they called us and we were really excited. He said we should record in Knochenhaus in Altona, a former parking lot of a department store, you could record there. So we went there and met Matze. And then things started. They thought the sampler was great so they told us to make an EP. I still think the music is terrible when I hear it today. The raps are awful. The beats are pretty cool though and it has an energy to it. So… Yeah. Davide Bortot There is a magic to a group or a crew that comes together, especially in rap. Like Wu-Tang where everyone has their own role or N.W.A. And I always thought your combination was very special. Especially with the four core members, Denyo, Platin Martin, you and DJ Mad. How would you describe the dynamic that you had? That you had in the early day and still have today. Even without Martin who left the group in ’97, ’98. How would you describe the dynamic between these characters? Jan Delay That’s hard to answer. Because it was really different in those days then it is today. You can’t really compare it. If we are talking about a time up to Bambule, Martin is still on two of those tracks. He quit the group during the making of that album. Back then we made beats at my place. Or at Martins. Even though that was difficult because his sampler was even smaller than mine. He got it from a newspaper subscription. No joke. He convinced his parents to subscribe to this newspaper so that he could get this little sampler. Davide Bortot What newspaper was this? Weapons and Dogs? Jan Delay Yes, Weapons and Dogs. It was this big with little buttons. And it had a three or four second sampler. And he always put the microphone in a garbage can for better sound. But it just sounded like shit. But he insisted. So it was even more complicated at his place than at mine. At my place we attached the microphone that someone brought along to a lamp. We had a four-track recorder. You always had to bring it. So you could record raps over a song. We didn’t have a compressor or anything like that.
The day I heard a delay or an echo effect on my snare drum or my vocals for the first time it blew me away, like hearing rap or Run D.M.C. for the first time. We didn’t have anything. It was like I said in the song. All we had was a pen, paper and talent. That was it. But you work so hard, you have an incredible energy. I don’t even know how we managed it all. We had to be at school early in the mornings or later sometimes. But somehow you have to manage that and on the weekends we were always at jams. From here to Munich it took like nine hours or something by train. Or to some little villages for jams and back home on Sunday and then back to school the next day. On holidays we went on some kind of tour. But you just do it. And you get the things you need. You work extra to afford the stuff you need, like a sampler or an MK2. We even published records while we went to school. And gave “real concerts.” I mean, we didn’t have much of an audience, but you still got a 100 bucks out of it. So you could buy the next thing and you started to exchange with other people in other cities and so on. So our knowledge grew and we accumulated equipment and we got better and better. And… What was the question again? Davide Bortot I forgot. I asked it like eleven minutes ago. Jan Delay When was that? When did we get started? We recorded our first demo on the 23rd of November 1991. Yes, for real. I remember because we recorded a song for a friend and it was his birthday the next day. So that’s why I remember the date. We started in ’91. I was 15, Dennis was 14 and Martin 16. Still recording with the keyboard. That was with the first sampler. Then we bought the first real sampler with MIDI in ’92. Martin got one too. DJ Mad got one too. And then it began with the arguments. Who has the best sampler? That’s what we were talking about, the dynamic. It caused an intense dynamic between us. Because everybody had their new sampler and we started to check out all the different beats. It was great. Not just in our band but with bands we were friends with too. Other bands came into the mix. DJ Dynamite, Main Concept from Munich. We did a lot with them, still do. And then everyone brings something to the table. These old records all contain beats from everyone. [to audience member] Sorry, what? Cocaine in the Coke? OK, I guess he just wanted to say that. Davide Bortot You mentioned Matthias and Ale who came from the punk scene. You were on a label that came from the punk scene. You were on the road with these bands. Is that something that distinguished you from other hip-hop bands or activists at the time? Jan Delay Growing up in Hamburg you’re already socialized differently and you are a lot more conscious about political issues and a tendency to protest. That reveals itself in the people around you and their music. Also the people I knew who made music played in hardcore bands. In our generation punk was gone. It was more American hardcore. It was shortly before crossover. Anyway, you already have a connection to the left and to punk rock and a culture of protest. I think that’s why our opinions, lyrics and especially our energy went in that direction. It was the same with punk rock, the bands from Hamburg were overly intellectual in their content. The fun punk was being made somewhere else. And that was the reason that many of these punk bands or Hamburger Schule bands saw something in us and supported us so much. We went on this first tour, “Etwas besseres als die Nation,” through East Germany in ’92 or ’93 when things were still going rough over there. And the left from Hamburg wanted to show some presence. So they all went there with bands from Hamburg. It was one bus full of bands. And two busses full with anti-fascist activists with shields and clubs and everything. The leader was Daniel Richter. If anyone recalls the name. A well-known painter from Hamburg. That’s how we went to the east. And basically said, “Here we are, what’s up?” We did come to slight disagreements with the locals. Here and there. They always brought us, the 15-year-old Beginners, to safety first. We had to get out of there. In Dresden or Leipzig. It was cool. They taught us a lot. Also about the business aspect of managing yourself in the music world. To do your own bookings, release your own records. They organised gigs for us or helped us with connections or whatever. We got a lot of support from them. That continued even when rap music from Hamburg got really big at the end of ’90s. We didn’t hang out at Flora so much anymore but still at the Dub Café. We also went to Ahoi, a bar located on Hafenstraße. They had a hip-hop night once a week. It was curated by Erik and all the writers from Hamburg met there, meaning the sprayers who made music and beats. After a while this moved to a bar called Pudel. So it always stayed within a certain group of people, who inspired themselves Davide Bortot We’re still talking about the first half of the ’90s. You’re still going to school but you’re already performing at concerts, going to jams, meeting other bands and so on. And the whole thing is growing and in other cities too. Did you already know this would be what you would do with your life? Did you make some kind of a decision during this time? Jan Delay I knew this was what I wanted to do with my life. But I didn’t think of it in terms of making a living with it. You didn’t think about that. That was blasphemy. Cora E said, “I live for hip-hop but I don’t live from hip-hop.” And that was the key sentence. It was a time where you didn’t have any examples that it was possible. Majors, pop music and charts were the enemies. You didn’t want anything to do with these things. You wanted to make your own decisions and certainly never wanted to perform on playback shows. And there weren’t any examples of it being possible without major labels. That changed with Fettes Brot and Freundeskreis. And Fünf Sterne Deluxe. I would say those were the first who made it possible. And you believed them when they told you about their experience. Then we realized how far we had come with the indie thing. We had released our first record, Flashnizm, our first LP. Our first real tour as headliners. That was the level we had reached. We were all finishing school at that time. We are still here, we are still getting better. These other bands, Freundeskreis and Fettes Brot, had shown that is was possible. Should we try? Or do we go on like this and slowly drift into oblivion. And we decided we wanted to try. We really improved so much in that one year. Especially in terms of rapping and beat making. And then we made Bambule. We didn’t expect it to take off like that, only in our dreams. I would have never thought that it had so much substance that you could live off it until today. And it’s not something I aspired to. It just kind of happened. And thankfully what you are doing keeps inspiring you to do new and different things. And ideally things actually work out. And so it happened. We did another record and I recorded a Jan Delay record. And apparently, enough people enjoy it, so you are able to make a living off it and focus on your work. That was the most important thing with our record Bambule. So that we are able to stay in the studio as long as we want and need. All of our records before sounded like shit. Because it had to be done quickly, since we had no money. We wrote, recorded and mixed Flashnizm in one month. Like I said in that song. It was really like that. And I was doing my community service on the side. And that’s how the album sounded. And we didn’t want that anymore. That’s why we wanted that major deal. We wanted the money to be able to afford the studio time as long as we needed to. That’s how you have the chance to produce something of quality. You teach yourself and you’re learning by doing. And if it’s successful you can do that on the next record too and so on. And then you can grow even bigger. And you think you’re good enough to perform in a big venue. That finally worked out and you just feel really thankful and really happy. But you weren’t following a plan. One thing just led to another. Davide Bortot Flashnizm, the record you were talking about, came out in ’96. I think you recorded it in ’95. And it’s not as bad as he always says. You can hear a lot of different influences on it. You were really trying things out. Dub, reggae, bossa nova. Bambule sounds completely different. Bambule might have been shaped by these experiences but it is a rap album. When and how did this change come about? Because we are talking about a period of two years. Jan Delay It came after Flashnizm. Flashnizm was done long before it came out. We had a Kraftwerk sample on it and everyone was afraid of releasing it and getting into trouble. We tried to solve that for a long time but it didn’t work. To get the rights for a Kraftwerk sample is a challenge in its own right. Especially as a small punk rock label from Hamburg. It took about nine months, so it came out about a year later. In that time we were already working on the next thing. It was ’96. We were done with school and had all day to make beats. There were even more beatmakers. And we triggered and motivated each other to become better and there was such good music coming from the US in those days. You had the time to think about it, to listen and to work all day on nothing else. And the exchange with Samy and Dynamite got much more intense in those days. Everything just clicked all of a sudden. We really made a huge leap in terms of beatmaking, flow and rap in those days. And we managed to let the language roll and understood why certain words had sounded like shit when we rapped “Bruttosozialprodukt.” Some things you just can’t rap. Unless you’re Hafti. Then it sounds great. Davide Bortot Bruttosozialprodukt. Jan Delay He can do it all somehow. That’s how we learned. Learning by doing. So we really made an incredible leap in that year by doing it on a daily basis. Like Sam. He also made an incredible leap that year. Becoming the rap god he now is. He quit school. Like he says in his songs, “Quit school, to record tracks with Jochen.” He freestyled all day every day on the microphone and if you do that for a year then you become what he became. You can hear it too when you listen to the old demos of No Nonsense. “Funky jam and everyone goes mad,” “Funky jam and everyone grooves to the beat.” That was a Samy Deluxe chorus before that phase. Then one year later, he became kind of a rap machine and then he starts going like, “Pure poison, show for the ears, dissembled hits of dynamite deluxe.” And you can’t believe that this happened in a year. Everyone made a leap like that in that year. Well, FAB was always really good. Everyone except FAB and Stieber Twins. Dendemann came to Hamburg. That definitely gave us a lot of input from a very different point of view.
We had a lot to do with rappers from Stuttgart. We really liked that they were much more evolved with their own parties and their own clubs. They had clubs where they only played hip-hop. In Hamburg we had clubs where they played hip-hop once a week. They had hip-hop clubs and they made that happen. Davide Bortot Which one? Jan Delay There were so many! On Reeperbahn you can put them in chronological order because one always replaced another. Before my time, like the generation of DJ Mad, Torch and the first hardcore graffiti generation of Hamburg, there was the Molotow Club on Reeperbahn, Defcon 5, where DJ Marius No. 1 and I think Coolmann played. Then my generation, we were four or five years younger. That started 1990 at the Tempelhof. Molotow had hip-hop downstairs and then came Power House. That was almost a hip-hop club. It used to be a gym for pimps. They build a club there. That was actually the best hip-hop club. I think that was 1995. At the same time we had Molotow like I said. At the end of the ’90s there was the Pudel. And that was the top spot. We were always there. In the Schanze neighborhood they renovated the Schlachthof and had the 33 1/3 Club every Friday. Great hip-hop club. We were there all the time. Those were the clubs until 2000 or so. Davide Bortot When did you record Bambule? Jan Delay Were you even interested in that? Davide Bortot About the clubs? Jan Delay [points to audience] He wanted to know. Anything to add? [laughs] Davide Bortot I thought it was interesting. But the clubs were important for you right? Your sound was very club-like somehow. Jan Delay Yes. That’s something we had in common with Stuttgart. A dream that our music could accomplish. We knew we weren’t there yet, like Primo for example, but that our own music would be played in clubs at some point. That was important to us because we all liked to go to clubs or were DJs. A big part of our lives happened there. Some of us earned a living there. That why it was important to us in Hamburg, just like in Stuttgart, that it sounds good. And I’m glad we were pushed to feel that way by our city and our sound because we had a real advantage there over other areas in Germany. Davide Bortot And now your music gets played in clubs and you’re embarrassed? Jan Delay Yeah. But that’s a different story. That’s a Hamburg thing too. But secretly you do feel happy and proud about. Davide Bortot In that whole Bambule time. In the unlikely case that someone here doesn’t know what Bambule is, Bambule was an album by the band Absolute Beginner from 1998. It shaped a big hip-hop boom in Germany. When did you know this was going to be a really good album? Was there a moment when you realized this could be something special? Jan Delay You mean before it came out, right? No, not really. What I do remember is that you always think it’s awesome the night you mix it. The next morning not so much. And the next evening it’s even worse. But this was the first time I didn’t feel that way. It was still awesome the next evening and even three evenings after that. And that a lot of people were talking to me about it. Telling me it was awesome. What stuck with me was that Bo said... I gave him some songs on Mini-Disc because he was begging me for them Davide Bortot Begging, not battling? Jan Delay Yes, he was asking for them. And he told me he was listening to it all the time and he couldn’t put his finger on what it was but that it was awesome. And that really stuck with me. And I thought, “Maybe it is really good.” Davide Bortot A Nardwuar question. Jan Delay What? Davide Bortot A Nardwuar question. Jan Delay What is that? Davide Bortot He is that interviewer. Jan Delay Ah yes. With the buzzer. Davide Bortot Yes. Exactly. Breakdance school. Someone once told me, I think it was Falk, that with Bambule you had the goal to make an album like Thriller. An album consisting only of singles. Is that true? Jan Delay That’s true. But it had nothing to do with Thriller. We wanted... Davide Bortot Like that is how you do it. Jan Delay Exactly. No, our goal was that every song on the album… When you work with a major label they want a single, we wanted every song to be good enough by our own standards that the label could pick any song to be a single. And we would be fine with it. And not be ashamed. At the time we didn’t know that you could be ashamed of the music video too. But that was our goal. And that’s why we worked on the album for so long. Doing things over and over again. Because that was very important to us. That we end up with 12 songs we all felt were good enough to be a single. I can bear hearing that one on the radio. Davide Bortot What video are you ashamed of? Jan Delay “Liebes Lied” of course. Davide Bortot When you look at the video today… Jan Delay Yes? This is stressing me out. Davide Bortot [laughs] I mean it was created somehow. You sat there and filmed it. Jan Delay Are you laughing because you’re thinking of the video? OK. Good. Davide Bortot Did you realize as you were shooting it that it might not be so cool? Jan Delay I’m not sure. We have to ask Dennis. I do remember how me and Dennis arrived at the set. Someone brought us to the studio. We arrived at this huge hall and there were like a 100 people doing something. And we looked at each other like, “What is going on here? All these people are working for us? Are they all making something that is going to have our name on it?” That was a real slap in the face. Not in a bad way. It was just a big moment. [addresses audience] Excuse me? It was this place in Jenfeld. Studio 662 or something as they were called back then. We were really impressed by all this. And kind of just did what we were told so when someone passed you a poorly fitting smoking [jacket] you put it on. Because it wouldn’t look so good to wear baggy pants in this theatre. So you just do it. So... What Mad had told us, and I think he was a little overwhelmed too by how much hip-hop would actually be in this video. In that moment we didn’t realize that it wasn’t really there anymore. We thought a lot more would come into it to make it cool in the end. And not like it actually turned out. And then we saw the result and thought, “At least the colors look good.” Davide Bortot Let’s talk about the positive aspects of that record and that time. The record came out and you went on tour with it. Jan Delay Yes. Davide Bortot When did you realize the dimension of it all? With Flashnizm you were performing at youth clubs. And then you release this record. Back then it wasn’t normal for a rap album to top the charts, that was something very special when it reached the charts. And suddenly there were big venues, fans, screaming girls and so on. When did you realize what was happening? And how did you cope with it? Jan Delay The good thing is that from putting microphones in garbage cans up to this point it always went step by step. And that caused everything to grow organically. It gives you a healthy sense of confidence. It isn’t the same as in one of these casting shows where people get in an elevator and go to the top in two weeks. And then they are up there and can’t cope with it. So we arrived at that point with a solid foundation. We didn’t expect it to happen like that. But we had seen what happened to Fettes Brot and Freundeskreis, so we knew what was possible. From the moment we finished the record to the point where it became a big hit things kept on growing step by step. You’re at a party and someone from MTV comes up to you to tell you how fantastic the album is, and wants to high five you like this. And you’re like, “OK, awesome.”
And you realize these kind of people like the album. And the boss of MCA Records, who signed us, he has the craziest voice I ever heard, that I ever heard, it was exactly the opposite of mine, his secretary told us you could hear the album playing in his office all day. It was the only thing he was listening to. So we thought, “OK, nice!” Tony Cottura, from Booya Family, who ruled pop music back then, told us that “Rock On” was a great beat. “Rock On” came out a little earlier. Those are moments where you realize something is happening. Or the first time a commercial for our single was on, like on the displays of the train stations. They didn’t have a time display yet but there was this really bad pixelated commercial screen and there it said, “Rock On” by Absolute Beginner is coming out. Those things were adding up and right before the record came out we were invited to a VIVA party because VIVA was turning so-and-so many years old, probably like six months old. And all the people who were in the charts back then were there. All these Young Deenays, or Down Low or whatever they were all called. Or Modern Talking. So that whole other world. Blümchen and who knows. And these people were coming up to us and saying how great it is what we are doing. Suddenly this other side likes us too. So something could really happen here. And then the record came out. Back then MTV was broadcast out of London, and so were the German MTV shows. So we flew to London and hosted the daily chart show there, suddenly we were a part of that world. I turn on MTV and someone calls to tell them he is listening to Bambule by the Beginner. And then we started the tour in January, in 1999. And in Düsseldorf 3,000 people came to the E-Werk. We had never experienced that. At a concert with just us, performing. At that point we knew it was something big. And the next day we all had our first cellphones. Someone called and told me to go and buy Bravo Magazine. And we had our first Bravo poster in that issue. And at that point we realized something had happened. Davide Bortot What really impressed me back then as a fan, here was this record, it was in the charts and you were a band, but around that there were a thousand other things. You were doing all this other stuff and there were all the other bands, Eimsbush, etc… All these different styles. Why was it so important to you to not just be Beginner but to do all this stuff as well? How did this band thing become kind of a movement? Jan Delay I think that just happened. And one thing had nothing to do with the other. It was the same with Sam, or Dynamite Deluxe as he was called back in the days. Their record came out through a major label with their own deal, just like Beginner had their own deal. It was a pretty banal reason, really. I was the manager of Dynamite Deluxe and we recorded the demo at Martin’s house with four songs, or maybe eight songs, and no record label wanted it. But our homies said how good it was. So we thought we would do it ourselves. We were hanging out in Eimsbüttel, which we called Eimsbush. Alright, then we will name the label like that. A colleague who was a writer, a graffiti artist, made the logo. Somebody else who wasn’t making music but wanted to do something would handle the business. And there were other homies, who were also making music, so we will release something on the label too. And so the whole thing becomes sort of a platform and since the bands received more and more recognition, the label of course did too. So there was a real demand and you start making t-shirts, etc… But that was also a point when I realized, “I want to make music! I want to do Beginner. I can’t do it all at once.” And it’s not my thing. It had to be 100% and it wasn’t. So I kept out of the daily business. Davide Bortot But aside from the Eimsbush label. There was this group of people doing things together. There was a crew. The time is well documented and you have talked about it before, but just to be clear, what and who exactly were the Mongo Clique? Jan Delay That all happened around the time during Bambule. At the end of ’96, beginning of ’97. ’97 probably. It was a group of people. The center of it was the Basement, which was also in Eimsbüttel, in the backyard at Schlump. Never paid any rent. The landlord was a great guy. He had a few strokes so he wasn’t totally there anymore. But he had a whole backlot that he only rented to artists. So people were practicing piano and rehearsing operas. And in the basement there were Tropf, Sam and Tim Beam. They moved in and that was were Sam freestyled all day. So there were a lot of people hanging out there. A lot of graffiti artists like Die Dreizehner... So, sort of a gang was formed. We hung around with people like FAB, even when FAB broke up, the members still hung out there. Ferris moved to Hamburg. He was always in the Basement because there was weed. And Dendemann came to Hamburg. He hung around there a lot. I think those were the bands. That was when the freestyle tape came out on Eimsbush. That documents that time. And Bo of course. I completely forgot. Bo was there everyday rapping and freestyling with Sam. The freestyle tape is basically the essence of that year. Casper and I had the great task of listening to like 100 hours of tape and eventually cutting and editing the tapes. What was the question again? What is the Mongo Clique? Davide Bortot Who was part of the Mongo Clique? Jan Delay We were all hanging out in the basement. And unfortunately the word Mongo kind of established itself from some people from Eppendorf. Bo said, “We are the Mongos. I mean look at us.” And everyone agreed. We were the Mongos. Then one day Bo and I came here to the Mercado in Ottensen. It’s still around, the place where you can make t-shirts. Respect to that woman. Because all the kids who came afterwards and wanted that sweater didn’t get it. We also picked the font. That awesome font with the drips. We picked the ugliest font, because we were the Mongo Clique. Although Mongo and ugliness have nothing to do with each other. And that’s no joke. It was an outsider thing. Whatever. Anyway, we went there to make these sweaters for everyone. And that’s when we basically decided who was in the clique. Because we had to make these sweaters. We wrote the persons name on the back. And on the front we put this beautiful Mongo Clique logo. That was in 1997. And if I’m not mistaken it was Bo and me, Sam and Jochen, AKA Dynamite and Tropf. A few people from Dreizehner, the graffiti crew. Ferris got one. Schnabel. One person joined later. That was Dendemann. We gave him his sweater half a year later. And that was the Mongo Clique. Davide Bortot Is it true that when the hype about Hamburg eventually started to come to an end, when it was kind of over, is it true that one of these sweaters was burned on stage? Or is that just a legend? Jan Delay What? Davide Bortot It’s a rumor that’s still going around. Yes, that you wanted to demonstrate that this time was over. So you burned a sweater at Flash Festival. Jan Delay No. Maybe some people from Berlin burned a Mongo Clique sweater. But not us. Davide Bortot But this time was over for you at some point right? You wanted to do something new. How did you experience that time? Jan Delay At a certain point there was just a total overkill of German rap. 1999 was the very best time and then there was that legendary month of April. So 19 years ago exactly. When Eins Zwo, Massive Töne, Freundeskreis and some others were all in the Top 10. The first five chart ranks were great German rap albums. That was pretty crazy. And the Flash Festival in Hamburg in 1999 was the absolute peak and the best concert ever and after that it was over. Everyone was there. Really. Everyone. It was an incredible night. It was sold out of course. The whole park was full of people. After that things started to go downhill. I mean it went up commercially but it wasn’t fun for us anymore. Because every label was signing random rap guys. Anyone with a baseball cap got a record deal. And there was just so much bad music coming out. The banks were offering hip-hop bank accounts. Like, “Yo, phat!” It was all just bad, ridiculous and at the same time you had to defend yourself for being in the charts and for selling out. And all that hate and dissing coming from Berlin. It got really annoying. To the point where I thought, “Fuck it. This is not for me.” And I had done that reggae song, the Nena cover. “That’s not hip-hop.” So I thought, “OK, I’m not doing hip-hop.” And I recorded a reggae album instead. Davide Bortot How did you make that reggae album? I mean, it is a different kind of music and a different approach pragmatically as an artist. How did you approach that album? Jan Delay I learned to make music through hip-hop. And when I made any other record, a reggae or a funk record, I always approached it like a hip-hop album. Not with sheet music but with a sampler. And with a few ideas and a small chunk of pot. No... I mean that you.. In this case we always played with musicians and bands and you don’t have to write down the notes, you can just sing it to the others or let someone else suggest something or use the musicians like a sample and loop them. That’s how I made that reggae album. We had already found each other before. It was the live band from the Flashnizm Beginners tour. Ali the bass player is still my bass player in Disko No. 1 and still the best bass player in the world. And we had the Sam Ragga Band and I made the record with the core members, the Jan Delay record and a few beats that I produced that we mixed in the Basement. We did the live music stuff at Matze’s place in Neuenfelde. It was sampled from these musicians. Like the roots reggae stuff like “Vergiftet.” Everything that was done with instruments was looped, sampled and arranged the way I made rap music. Davide Bortot Your next album Mercedes Dance came out five years later in 2006. So it took quite a while. And I remember when you played the album for me. Before it was released you were unsure what would come of it, right? The third Beginners album Blast Action Heroes came out in 2003 and you toured and it was really successful and the Beginners were well established. But you as a solo artist, making yet another style of music that was even less connected to hip-hop, even though of course the influence was still there… Is it just my memory, or was it really unclear to you that you could have a career as a solo artist? Jan Delay No. It was a little bit like with Bambule, when you don’t really know and you dream of it maybe, but you don’t know and you don’t want to assume anything because it happens so often that you or others look forward to something and then it doesn’t happen and you are all the more down. So, no. And it was a really difficult time for making the album. I wanted to give up several times so, yeah. Your impression was right on that record... I was little bit fed up with German rap. Once again. Maybe not fed up, but I needed a break from it. If you spend one, two or three years intensely dealing with German rap and in that process listen to everything that German rap has to offer then you have enough of it at some point and you want to do something different, and I wanted to do a mix of different things. I wanted to make an album for clubs. I thought there were really good rap albums from Germany. And songs that could be played in clubs. But there wasn’t anything playing that you could define as urban. Just a combination of different and good musical directions that you could play in a club and I felt like making funk music. And I felt like having an awesome band. I was DJing a lot at the time. And I wanted a band that could play these club sounds. So I found the people based on that. And I made the beats based on that. They were still mostly programmed and not played. Unlike the album after that. It was exhausting, because it didn’t always turn out the way I wanted it. There weren’t really any successful examples I could listen to. I wanted beats and the intensity of beats. But I also wanted the funkiness and liveliness of funk. And it’s very hard to combine programmed music with live music. Especially if you haven’t done it before and nobody else has either, really. That almost made me quit. I was close to abandoning the project once. But thankfully I ended up doing it with Matze’s and Tropf’s help. So when I finished it I was exhausted and couldn’t really judge what I had. Davide Bortot You’ve been making music for 27 years now. Absurd. Sorry. That’s a very long time. And I don’t have the feeling you’re going to quit anytime soon. It’s your thing and you’re living it. Was there ever a moment in all these years where you thought, “Fuck this. I’m going to do something different”? Or how did you manage to maintain that fire and that passion? And maintain that energy through all those years? Jan Delay I think I kept the passion and the fire because for the last 27 years I drank a can of Red Bull every day. [laughs] No! I was waiting for the Red Bull gag. It wasn’t planned. It just came. No, get away with that. I think it tastes really bad. Davide Bortot Now that we have settled that, what else do you do, to keep the passion? Jan Delay But I really do think the Red Bull Music Academy is a good thing! Even though I don’t like the taste of Red Bull, it’s still a good thing Davide Bortot We have ten minutes. Jan Delay Ten minutes to talk about Red Bull! Davide Bortot Let’s focus on important things. Jan Delay Yes. Fire and passion. I’m sure there were moments when… Not that I thought, “I’m quitting music, fuck you all.” But I just thought, “Fuck you all.” No, there was that moment that I mentioned earlier. The hip-hop overkill and all the dissing. Where I thought, “That sucks, I don’t want that. Fuck you guys.” I suggested that to Dennis and Mad, I told them... During the Flash Festival 2000, at the Millerntor Stadium, in front of 19,000 people, “Let’s roll out a banner after the show that just says, That was all, you c--ts.” The c--ts part was just a suggestion. Just to roll out a banner saying, “That’s all!” And they said, “Sure, why not?” I mean you have to imagine we were together all the time for three years. And we experienced really great things, but also really shitty things, and when you haven’t had time to really reflect, like, in the moment... The shitty part is hard to ignore. I mean, it was clear that we would continue to make music in some form. Just something different maybe. So they said, “Sure.” But then Mad called us two days later and said, “We can’t do that.” So we all got together and he made a passionate speech about why we had to go on. And we said, “Yes! You’re right! We’re gonna do two solo albums and then we continue together.” So there were moments of quitting. But I never wanted to quit music entirely. But before Mercedes Dance, after Blast Action Heroes, there was a sense of resignation because the music market had collapsed back then. I couldn’t, either as Absolute Beginners or as Jan Delay, I didn’t have, like, a live show that could fill concert halls and that I could live off. We depended on the money that the records made. And that really collapsed in 2003 or 2004, illegal downloads were really popular then. Before that began to check itself Blast Action Heroes wasn’t exactly Thriller. I mean sales-wise. Or Bad. You have to re-orient yourself or see what else you can do if you want to work with music. I was a little worried at the time. Because I didn’t expect things to develop so well later on with Jan Delay or with the Beginners. Davide Bortot When you make music today... What is the biggest difference to how you were making music 27, 26 or 23 years ago? Is there something you learned or changed in all those years? And what is your mode today? In contrast to how it used to be. Jan Delay That’s difficult. I learned and experienced so much, of course, you can imagine, in 27 years, so it’s impossible to compare. You learn and experience so many things that you become a lot calmer, much more relaxed about things, but that makes you more susceptible to laziness in certain areas. Especially like technical things, I let it slide there a little bit and stopped nerding around so much, I stopped wanting to be able to join the conversation. Is that how you say it? The world is changing at such speed that if you want to stay on top of that stuff, that alone can fill a lifetime. I realized I wanted to focus on good lyrics and on being a good entertainer putting on a good show, making good songs and good records and… Let other people get into the technical stuff and then I just ask them if I need their help. That’s a real change. 27 years ago I was so… I had such a desire to control things. I wanted to be able to do it all by myself. I had to do it all by myself. I don’t feel that way anymore. Today you do what you do best. And everyone involved does what they do best. And that gets the best results. And everyone is satisfied and happy. Davide Bortot I know you don’t really like to be in this role of an uncle, but since the Red Bull Music Academy is all about learning and new experiences and I know a lot of people are watching that make music themselves, what would you say – from today’s standpoint as someone who has experienced a lot – what is the most important thing to keep in mind for someone who thinks, “It would be cool to make music”? Jan Delay [pauses] You mean it in the sense that making music would be cool if I’m on YouTube and I’m earning money with it and not like, I want to learn to play the clarinet? Davide Bortot No. That’s all. Jan Delay I think those are two very different things. Davide Bortot I meant the process of making music. I don’t know about the clarinet, but “I want to make beats.” I mean, just making music. Jan Delay And not wanting to be a star? Davide Bortot I think there is a lot of information already on how to be a star, but what do you think is the most important thing when you just want to make music? What could you tell people who still have a long road ahead of them? Jan Delay If they just want to make music, that’s easy. Just do it. That’s great. Because there is no wrong or right. That’s the great thing about music. What I consider wrong might be just right for someone else. And vice-versa. That’s art. You should just do it. If you have that voice and feel like it. Just do it. No matter what it sounds like. [someone walks in front of stage] That’s M. Hey M. What’s up? What did I want to say? There is no right or wrong and it doesn’t matter how it might sound to others, if you like it yourself, or even if you don’t like it, but if you enjoy the process, then you should do it. It’s great and you learn so much. I think especially with kids, and leading educators agree, that music helps you to evolve and stimulates creativity. It helps you, as stupid as this may sound, to become a better person to understand and learn better techniques, to get smarter. Learning an instrument helps a child to develop social skills too, to be among other kids. Sounds stupid, but it is really true. And you should just do it if you have the desire. You should even do it if you don’t have the desire. Everyone should make music. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin should make music. The world would be a much better place. Davide Bortot Thank you! We have five minutes left. We have to stop on time, because they are showing a film afterwards. But as the tradition has it here the audience can ask a few questions. We have five minutes, maybe we can do three questions. But they have to be really good. Jan Delay No shit! Davide Bortot Hold on. We need a microphone! We need a microphone, so the people at home can hear the question. Jan Delay I’m a professional. Is there anyone but him? Otherwise I’ll ask him. There are enough. In the back, I think over here, was the first question Davide Bortot Wait. Wait. Microphone. Jan Delay Yes, that’s good. Audience Member Is there ever going to be another La Boom album? Jan Delay Somebody asked me that at a traffic light in Berlin yesterday. That’s one of these things. It’s really fun, but it’s so time-consuming, and the balance between time and effort and the final result, there are things that Tropf and I want to do just as badly, but these things usually lead to a Jan Delay or Beginners album. A lot more people benefit from those, so we usually go with that, but if we would check our computers now, and looked at all the stuff we discarded over the last 20 years and we would lock ourselves in for two months... Yeah, but we have kids too. Davide Bortot So that’s a yes. Next year a new La Boom album? Jan Delay Then we might actually do it. We both feel like doing another. It’s not like that’s not the case. Who knows? Davide Bortot Any other questions? There! Just ask the question and then Jan can repeat it. Audience Member Which German artist you haven’t worked with would you like to collaborate? Jan Delay Rio Reiser. And Falco. That’s true, Falco isn’t German. But… There are a few. But I wanted to call them myself and not talk about it publicly. [question from audience] Oh, yes, but like I said before… Davide Bortot Dude, I thought you were a pro? Jan Delay Oh, yes. She wanted to know if I have had a plan B. And she thought our little talk was great. There wasn’t a plan B. But there was always a plan A. Of what I wanted to do later. I did study for three days once. I studied business with DJ Dynamite for like a day and half. Because you didn’t need good grades to get in. After one and a half days we just got up and left. I studied music until the end of the semester. At that point it was clear it would have something to do with music. I don’t know. Running a label or something, or becoming a manager, because at that point I assumed that there was making music and then there was making money and that it was difficult to combine the two, but by managing bands, it might be possible. I also wanted to be a cook once. But then I realized how early you have to get up for that. Davide Bortot One more question. Over there. Audience member Hello. You said earlier that the Mongo Clique clothing were only made for the actual members. But there was that bootleg online shop for a really long time. It just went offline. Jan Delay There were already bootlegs before the internet. They were selling them at the train station in Hanover. We tried to do something about it a few times. Because we weren’t happy about it. Not because we wanted a piece of the action, but because we didn’t want random people walking around in our sweaters. We tried to stop it. But they were shady guys, they just changed locations or just founded another fake company. After a while you just got tired of it. And the lawyers were very expensive. So we just let them be. Yes, that would have been a waste. Davide Bortot Ok, we can do one more . Jan Delay Maybe a good question that rounds up the evening. [laughs] Audience member OK, I think I got one. The three most famous Beginners albums are pretty clear– Jan Delay OK, not that question! [laughs] Audience member Advanced Chemistry and… How do you explain the extreme difference between the albums? They are all so different. Jan Delay You mean beginning with Bambule? OK. It always has something to do with the time they were made in. Bambule... No that’s too nerdy, they are just how we were at that point in time. That’s how they sound, I think. Bambule is Bambule and Advanced Chemistry is Bambule at 40. And the stuff in between is not that good. We made those because we wanted to make another album together. We weren’t so attentive to quality. So there is some stuff on there that should not be on there. Too much ego and too little help. We wanted to do it all on our own. There are some good songs on it. But also some not-so-good songs. Come on. Now a really good last question Davide Bortot There’s another question. A very determined raised hand. Audience member Yes, hello. We have heard that there are a lot of things you are embarrassed about. What is the most embarrassing thing? In those 27 years? Jan Delay Well, definitely that music video for “Liebes Lied.” There was another situation. It happened at MTV Open, Hip-Hop Open in Stuttgart. With the reggae album. And the first bands started at around 10 and around seven, when I started, the show was broadcast live, so I’m at this hip-hop festival with my reggae music and everyone I know is watching at home and then it’s starting, and I see my drummer fidgeting around and he tells me Hartmut’s click isn’t working. Click is a sound that is played in your ear that sets the tempo, and I knew if he didn’t have a click we had a serious problem, and it was live. Like, “We have to start, we have to start.” And he just couldn’t fix it. And they pressured us to start. And he started counting and already his tempo is too slow and I’m going onstage thinking, “Everybody can hear it, everybody can tell.” Reggae is slow as it is, but it just kept getting slower and I was singing like… Looking back at him, that was very embarrassing too. Because it was live on television. Otherwise I would have been relaxed about it. Davide Bortot But we have to end on a positive note. Jan Delay I think that was great. Davide Bortot OK then, another question. Jan Delay But I thought they had to watch a film here. Davide Bortot Yes. What’s playing anyways? Nevermind. Very last question. There in the center. Audience member What happened to the Werder Bremen (football team) anthem? Jan Delay It’s done. Yes. It’s done. I have to shoot a video. And Spotify. I have to take care of all that shit. Especially the video, and it’s turning out to be very complicated because
the DFL [German Football League] owns all the rights. So if you want to shoot during a game or use footage it’s basically impossible. I don’t know if I should be saying this, I love the German Football League! Davide Bortot In reality he is hoping Bremen will qualify for the European Cup and that’s when he will finish the song. Jan Delay But the song is done and it’s great, and it will be released for the first game of the new season. But as people from Hamburg, you don’t really care, do you? Davide Bortot But everything else was really interesting. So a big round of applause for Jan Delay! [applause]

Jlin
Jerrilynn Patton, better known as Jlin, is proof that geography has no bearing on success in the internet era. Born and raised in Gary, Indiana, a city notorious for extreme violence and poverty alike, Patton is now one of electronic music’s leading artists.
While her soundscapes are rooted in footwork’s blistering rhythms, they also reimagine the parameters of the genre. After discovering footwork while majoring in math at Purdue University, Patton began ditching classes to study music from genre pioneers like RP Boo and DJ Rashad. As she developed as a producer, she befriended Boo and Rashad on MySpace and, in 2011, her track “Erotic Heat” caught the attention of Planet Mu founder Mike Paradinas, who included it on the label’s Bangs & Works, Vol. 2 compilation. Not convinced that her music would sustain her financially, Patton worked at a local steel mill while she composed her universally-acclaimed 2015 debut, Dark Energy. Her sophomore release, Black Origami, received even greater praise for its bold deployment of punishing percussion and rhythms from around the world. While she’s already expanded the limits of footwork and forged a path for women in the still male-dominated world of electronic music, Patton has continued to chart new territory with Autobiography, a score for her collaboration with renowned British choreographer Wayne McGregor.
In her lecture at RBMA Berlin 2018, Jlin talked about her roots, mental health and the importance of mistakes in order to stay true to yourself as an artist.
Hosted by Chal Ravens On the couch with me now is an artist of a most unusual kind. She has released an EP and two albums, soon to be three, since 2015. Jlin Yes. Chal Ravens And writers like myself still don’t really have a clue what to call what she does. She is inarguably one of the most distinct voices in electronic music right now. Let’s welcome Jlin. Jlin Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you guys for coming. Chal Ravens I think we’re going to start with a track. We’re going to start with the track that was really the track that launched you. It’s called “Erotic Heat”, and it was on a compilation called Bangs & Works Volume Two which, along with Volume One, was pretty instrumental in exposing people to footwork outside of Chicago, it came out on Planet Mu in 2011. Jlin Right, right, right. (music: Jlin – “Erotic Heat”) Jlin Thank you. Thank you. Chal Ravens It’s a strong start, really. So that record was on a Chicago footwork compilation, but you have spent most of the last three years trying to explain to people that you don’t make footwork. Jlin Yeah. Chal Ravens One word that you have used to describe your music previously is naked. Jlin Yes. Naked, vulnerable, because when I create, that’s the space that I’m creating from, I’m creating from a very vulnerable state, from the core of my being, and then presenting it into the rest of you guys to hear. It is very naked and it’s raw and that’s why I described it as naked like that, yeah. Chal Ravens Especially with dance music, with electronic music, there can be such an urge to categorize and put things in genres and sub-genres. Jlin Right, for sure. Oh yeah. [Laughs] Chal Ravens And you were, perhaps, always aware that you didn’t want to end up in that? Jlin Yeah. I created from a space where, like I said, I’m just creating. I love to compose music. A lot of times, I do understand when a journalist is writing or you have writers and people interviewing you, for reference purposes, you’ll put something into a category. I definitely get that, but then what I started to realize is that writers would just start repeating what they heard another publication say. And so I got tired of hearing “Jlin, steel mill, and footwork” in the same... It just got aggravating. So I literally, one day, I tweeted out and said, “Please, somebody write something different.” Because I get tired of hearing this. I’m so much more than that. Then when Black Origami came out, that really was an album that started to challenge the writer. This actually told me, was the journalist even actually really listening? Because at that point, it really got to the point where it was like, were are you actually listening or did you just hear a publication say “Jlin footwork” and then you just started repeating it? It became like Chinese telephones after a while. I was just like, Jesus. I mean, is this what we’ve come to with writing? Chal Ravens We love to repeat each other. Just recycle that stuff. Jlin It just, you know. So I ended up having to really explain myself. The worst thing that’s ever happened to me, journalism-wise, is when I had a journalist come up to me and he wanted to interview me. It was a Skype call and he’s like, “So your name is Jlin?” And I’m like, “Yes.” And he’s like, “So what do you do? You rap?” And I say, “Oh, this interview’s over.” So I ran back and I told my label, “You guys, hey, please make sure the person at least knows what I do because this isn’t cool.” It’s not cool. It’s already bad enough I’m getting pigeonholed. Now I have to deal with somebody who doesn’t even know what it is that I do? I said, “I can’t do that.” We can’t work like that, you know? Yeah. Chal Ravens So you don’t rap? Jlin No, I don’t rap. [Laughs] Chal Ravens Scratch that out. So let’s just go back to “Erotic Heat,” that came out in 2011. Jlin Yeah, yeah. Chal Ravens Did you make it a little bit before that, I guess? Jlin Yeah. I made it actually before that. I made “Erotic Heat” at the end of... I think it was actually right at the end of 2009, early 2010. Chal Ravens Could you sort of set the scene for us in terms of where you were when you made it? Jlin I was actually terrified when I made it because it had... I was working on making footwork tracks, but then I remember it was a turning point in my career when I had sampled Teena Marie’s “Portuguese Love.” Like I always do, I had my mom come in and sit on the end of my bed. I do this to this day, and she listens to the track I made. She’s always the first person to listen. And so what happened was I had done this track where I sample Teena Marie, and she’s like, “It sounds good, but what do you sound like? I know what Teena Marie sounds like, but what do you sound like?” And I was like, you know, that’s a hell of a good question. What do I sound like? I didn’t know myself. So that’s when “Erotic Heat” came out. Now, the thing about it was at that time, because I was thinking that I was so embedded into footwork, I’m like, this isn’t going to be acceptable because it doesn’t even sound like a footwork track. And I was scared to put it out, but then I remember putting it on Facebookm where you could upload videos. And I put it up there and I got such a response to it. One of the responses was Mike Paradinas, who said, “I have to have this on this compilation. It is imperative that this is on there. This has to be on this compilation.” So that’s how it started. Chal Ravens And when you say it didn’t sound like footwork, I mean specifically, it’s the lack of samples? Jlin It was the lack of, no, it was the way that I was... Because there are samples in it, but it was the way that it was... Chicago footwork has such a distinct sound. You know it when you hear it. There’s the repetitiveness of the way that the track is moving. Most tracks are usually at 160, it was like a solid tempo of 160. And so it’s like you know it when you hear it. “Erotic Heat” was just so all over the place. It was just like, well, where does this go into this type of a thing? Yeah. Chal Ravens And another thing separating you from the footwork thing – you’re not from Chicago? Jlin No, I’m not from Chicago. I’m from Indiana. A lot of people think that I’m from Chicago because, you know, but I’m not. I’m from Indiana, I’m an hour outside. Chal Ravens A town called Gary? Jlin Yeah, I’m from Gary. Chal Ravens Not the only prominent musician from Gary, Indiana. Jlin No. Chal Ravens Anyone? Michael Jackson? Jlin Right, yeah. Chal Ravens Freddie Gibbs also. Jlin Yeah, Freddie Gibbs as well, yeah. Chal Ravens Can you just tell us, what’s Gary like? Jlin Gary, it’s an industrial town. As a matter of fact, I worked in the steel mill myself for four years. It’s an industrial town, small town, I think a population of... it’s gone down tremendously. I think it’s about maybe 80,000 now. So it’s just a small town. For me, obviously, it’s always been home for me. I was born and raised there. I still live in the same house that I grew up in. I’m still at home. So when people ask me what do I do, I usually just tell them I’m a professional bum. That’s always been home for me. I love home and I just love being there when I’m not on the road. Chal Ravens So what happened was that Rick Owens, the fashion designer, used that track in his fashion show a few years later. Yeah? Jlin Yeah, in 2013. Chal Ravens And that kicked off a pretty hectic period for you. Jlin Yeah. Rick Owens got the train started. Chal Ravens So just to be clear, what were you doing in that period between 2011 and 2014? You were just making tracks? Jlin Yeah, I was just... I have to compose like I have to breathe. I just love doing it. So during that time, yeah, I was working. I had just started working at the steel mill in 2012. I just got hired, so I was working. I had just crossed my probation period at the job, and so I was working on that. And then all of a sudden, Rick Owens just came out of nowhere and hit my label up. And then my label introduced us, and then he told me what he wanted me to do. It hadn’t dawned on me who he was until, I think I was getting off midnights at work, and I laid down and I thought about. And I was like, wait a minute, Rick Owens, Adidas Rick Owens? I was like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa.” So I went to look it up and it turns out I’m like, “Oh my God, yeah, this is that same guy.” So I was like, yeah. As fast as the moment came that I was excited was as fast as it left, because I was like, I want to put the work into this. And I told him – because he wanted me to remix it, and I was like, “I’m not remixing ‘Erotic Heat’. I’ll remake it though,” and so I did. There’s a 13-minute version of Erotic Heat. If you come to the 4D show, you’ll hear it because that’s the last track I’m closing with. Chal Ravens So after that point you kind of blew up – because by the end of 2015, your debut album had come out, which was in many, many end of year lists. I think it was The Wire’s number one album of that year. Your track, “Expand”, was the New York Times’ number eight track of that year. Jlin I was at work when that happened. Chal Ravens You were at work? Jlin I was at work, like I had everybody calling me, and I was at work. I was literally ... My mom’s like, “You’re in the New York Times and you’re number eight.” I think I was right under Missy Elliott’s “I’m Better,” if I’m not mistaken. Chal Ravens That makes sense. Jlin Then I think I was in between her and Madonna, between those. It was the craziest thing. It was like, wow, I couldn’t... And Holly was in Mexico, and I had to call her and tell her. Chal Ravens Right, the track is a collaboration with Holly Herndon. Jlin Yeah. So I called Holly from work and I’m like, “Yo, we’re in the New York Times,” and she’s like, “Shut up.” And I’m like, “No, I’m serious.” She’s like, “Send me the link right now.” So I’m like, “OK.” So I sent it to her and she was like, “That’s bizarre.” Because that was an experiment for us. We literally did that track as an experiment. That’s how we met. She heard “Erotic Heat” and she’s like, “Hey, I’m gonna just shoot you some stems and you just do what you want to do with them.” And next thing I know, “Expand” came out. And we were just doing it for fun. We didn’t know it would go to the extent that it did. Chal Ravens So the album is Dark Energy. I’m not going to play that track. We might come back to some Holly Herndon. I’m gonna play my personal favorite. Why not? Jlin [Looking at CDJs] Oh boy. Chal Ravens This is called “Guantanamo.” ‘Cause I thought we should just go hard. (music: Jlin – “Guantanamo”) Jlin [Laughs] I’m sorry, but every time you guys clap, I laugh because for me, it’s so nice. First of all, let me just say thank you guys for coming. It’s so nice when a person appreciates your work, and I’m happy that you guys took the time out today to come and see me have this chat. I just wanted to tell you guys thank you first before we go any further. Thank you, guys. Chal Ravens Maybe we were worried that you’d be in a bit food coma. So, “Guantanamo.” Jlin Yeah. Like if you go to sleep, I will not judge you because these are comfy couches. So I will not judge you at all. I see some of y’all got your shoes off, and I think that’s really smart. If it were me up here and I could be back there at the same time, I’d be asleep. So I’m just saying firsthand. Chal Ravens So, I said at the beginning that us copycat writers are really struggling to think of some good words. I mean, obviously footwork is the kind of basic root here somewhere, but quite often I think your tracks just feel like they’re just kind of sui generis. They come out of nowhere. I guess comparisons are rarely invoked for you, but at the same time, everybody listens to music growing up. What did you like when you were a kid? Jlin When I was a kid, I loved Sade. I love Sade. Yeah. Sade is my favorite artist in the world. So that’s what I grew up listening to. I grew up listening to Phoebe Snow and Phyllis Hyman, and Anita Baker, Rachelle Ferrell. It’s so funny because when I went and got to my high school years, I hit the whole Evanescence [thing] and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. It was just such a ... Chal Ravens I think we’re the same age. Jlin Yeah. I know it’s probably funny, but I thought Britney Spears’ “Toxic” song was the shit when I first heard it. Yeah. It was like, “That’s my jam.” Chal Ravens Did you play any instruments? Jlin No. I had exactly two piano lessons, but then I later discovered that math and music are exactly the same. And that’s something that Herbie Hancock
talks about quite a bit. And so I discovered they really are exactly the same. Even when I’m sitting down to write music now, it’s when I can’t figure something out or if I’m trying to... I’ve just kind of learned that they’re the same language, but I think I had to grow into that. It’s just one of those things. That was more of a learning experience over time. Chal Ravens And you studied maths? Jlin Yeah, at least that’s how it started. And then later, I had dropped out and instead of going to a class like I was supposed to be doing, I used to go to the library and make music. And that’s how this all actually got started. But the weird thing is before I would start making music, I used to go to my university early in the morning, at like 6 o’clock in the morning, and I would just work out calculus problems on the board when nobody was there. I used to just do this, do this for at least maybe three or four hours. And then I would go to the library and do music for the rest of the day, which was really weird. I don’t know what was going on at that time in my head. Chal Ravens So over time you’ve kind of branched away from the footwork connection. But I’m interested in when you first encountered it, what was your relationship with Chicago footwork then? Jlin I was four when I first heard it. I was four years old and I’d never heard anything like it. So you know, when you hear something that you feel is amazing and you never heard anything like it, you’re trying to find more of it, as much as you can. That became something I used to listen to all the time. And then when I was in high school, we ended up doing the talent show that had, it was actually a footwork routine, a dance routine. We didn’t end up doing the routine though, but I just never forgot that sound. It just stuck with me. It was one of those things. It stood out because I had never heard anything like it before. Yeah. Chal Ravens And then did you start getting involved and going to Chicago, dancing? Jlin No. [Laughs] Chal Ravens No? So you were always actually… Jlin You know what’s so funny? This is the saddest thing ever, and I know people are going to be like, “J, that is an abomination.” But I have never been to Chicago footwork battle ever. And they’re like, “But you live right in Indiana. There is no excuse for that.” And I’m like, “Actually there is.” I used to work like 96 hours a week. So when I was working in the steel mill, I used to work around the clock. And so it was just, I never really... It’s not that I didn’t want to, I just never... My timing was just so crazy. But it’s funny though, because I had a lot of Chicago footworkers that actually performed with me at the Pitchfork show. When we were in Chicago, they were on the show with me the same time, which I was very honored by because that was such a last minute thing. When that happened a lot of people were like, “Was that planned?” I’m like, “No, it wasn’t.” I was honored that they would be willing to do that for my show. Chal Ravens Are there particular footwork producers who you feel more inline with? It doesn’t all sound the same, obviously. Jlin Yeah. For sure. You have the pioneers. You have RP Boo, you have Rashad, you have Clent, you have Traxman, and Deeon. You have all these different producers, and all the guys that pioneered. I honestly have to say, the person that I felt the most in connection with, even though he’s passed away now, was probably Rashad. Because Rashad had no limitation on what he would do or what he would try musically. I really liked that he never stayed in a box. He was trailblazing up until he passed away. It was amazing to witness, actually. Chal Ravens Footwork obviously can be a very functional music. Footwork itself is a dance, but I think with your music, and thinking of your story, often it provides quite a personal listening experience. I listen to it on headphones, it’s a very one-on-one relationship in some ways. I wanted to ask you if there’s any particular music that you have had that very personal communion with, that very one-on-one relationship? Jlin Yes, recently Philip Glass. I know that’s probably like... I just heard the reactions from the audience when I said Philip Glass, I’m sure they were like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa. We just did a 180.” If you guys ever get a chance, if you haven’t done it already, one of the most genius albums I’ve ever heard was Philip Glass’ for the movie The Hours. That is a classic. I was just blown away, honestly. Another person who I feel like I can really connect with as well, musically, when I hear their music – and her personality as well – is Eartha Kitt. I really feel that I can definitely connect. I always said if I can make my music dance like Eartha Kitt, I think I’d be batting a thousand. Chal Ravens I wanted play a little bit of a track, one of the few tracks that you’ve ever explicitly cited as an influence, and it’s a Sade track. I might not play all of it, but let’s just hear a little bit of this Sade track, and you can say why it might be your favorite. Jlin Oh. (music: Sade – “Love Is Stronger Than Pride”) Chal Ravens We should probably clap for Sade. I was thinking I should just play half of that, but where would you even stop that track? Jlin I was about to say, I probably would have cried if you stopped in the middle. Chal Ravens Yeah, so would I. Tell me why that track might speak to you. Jlin Because for me that track is so complex in so many ways, and there’s such a beauty to it, to its complexity. To me, if you’re not somebody that listens to... you could listen to one type of a genre... I think Sade is so ahead of her time. From her first album in ‘84, Diamond Life, to now – she was 10 years ahead when she started. I feel like she’s a classic. She is such a standalone. I really, musically, for me, I try to also emulate that, being a standalone. Having that own identity. You know Sade when you hear Sade. You can hear a riff or 30 seconds of a song, and you know that’s Sade, and I try to emulate the same thing, which is not easy. It’s so easy to be trendy, it’s hard as hell to be authentic though. That’s what a lot of artists... That separates an artist who’s a classic from an artist that’s just gonna fall off as a trend, who just has their 15 minutes of fame. Unfortunately, on the radio now, you’re listening to five artists and out of five different artists, four songs probably have the same producer. Which, to me, it’s a state of hypnosis now. I don’t even know what’s new anymore. When people ask me about different artists and they’re like, “Have you heard this?” Or “Have you heard that?” I’m like, “No,” because it’s kind of hard listening to the same thing. Even when I’m in a club setting or a festival setting, and I’m walking in, and I’ve heard the same four on the floor beat for the past... it’s been five artists who’ve played, and four of them have played that same rhythm. Then I’ll come in and I’ll play behind them, and they’re like, “This was so amazing. You were the best artist in the show.” It’s like, no, not necessarily, it’s just that you’ve been sitting here listening to the same thing for the last six hours. It’s like, “Where do we stop?” That’s what I love, artists who are innovative and they’re not being trendy because it takes audacity to be authentic. It’s an audacity, it’s a boldness, it’s a willingness to be humiliated to do that. A lot of artists don’t understand that. When I’m up there playing, or I create something, I’m not just creating. That’s what I mean when I say my music is naked, because I am creating from the core. I’m not trying to be trendy. I’m not doing this for you to tell me, “Jlin, this was great.” I’m don’t this because that’s who I am as a person. Chal Ravens Let’s get into some specifics. Tell me a little bit about how you tried to find the authenticity, and break away from the sounds that you’re already hearing – something about what it is that is unique about what you do. Jlin When my mom posed the question to me, and said, “What do you sound like?”, that made me wonder. That was that wonder, what do I sound like? Where do I fit in to this whole grand scheme of music, of whatever? It was just like, what is my sound? When I created “Erotic Heat” I was like, “Man, I’ve never heard anything like it.” It was new for me. I was just like, “OK,” and then, I just kinda rolled with it. It grew on me. It’s not that I discovered a sound, it was more like I took a journey into the sound and we embraced each other. I embraced it, and it’s ever-evolving. That’s the thing, it’s not just one thing, which is why, with the ballet, with Autobiography, it’s so different, so many different skills of how it sounds because all of that is me. I think duality is really important. Versatility is really important, I think, in anything you do. Having the duality, to me, is a nice touch because when you are versatile as an artist it says, “I can do more than one thing. I can do more than two things. I can do three things.” However many things you can do. I can tie this in with that thing. That’s why me and Wayne McGregor work so well together, because it’s just like, he tells me his vision, and then I can just tie it in together. It’s like being a chameleon. I like being that chameleon, I have to say. Chal Ravens Wayne McGregor is the choreographer of Autobiography, which is your new ballet score. We’ll get to that. Can you just describe your studio setup for us? Jlin Yeah. My studio setup is very... actually, I’m about to demolish it when I go back home because I’m tired of it. [Laughs] My studio set up consists of – I have my laptop, and I have Genelec speakers, the 8020s. I have two Ableton Push 2s, I have the Maschine. I had the Akai Pro but I gave it away to a friend. I use Kontakt, I’m sure you guys are well aware of Kontakt, and the new one coming out and all that. I’m a Native Instruments [user], I’m an Ableton user. I use FL Studio. I use Reason 5 and 6. Whatever mood I’m in is just what I use. Predominantly though, I use FL Studio, but I will definitely go into Reason 5 and 6. That’s kinda how my setup is right now. Like I said, I’m gonna go and destroy the whole thing when I go home. Chal Ravens The first album... Let’s not misread this. The title is Dark Energy. Jlin Yes, because everybody kept calling it Dark Matter for the longest. [Laughs] Chal Ravens Not Dark Matter. In an old interview, you once said that you “create from a place that is the belly of the beast”, but I don’t want to misread what Dark Energy means in this kind of scenario. Tell me a bit about that because I think, again, it can be easy to get into the tortured genius myth... Jlin No, that’s not what that means at all. The belly of the beast, what that means is that I create from a space that is uncomfortable. When I say that I don’t mean that I’m in a tortured space. That means that I’m being forced to create from my core, and a lot of people, I have found, won’t do that. I won’t use MIDI patterns from myself or from an old track. I refuse to. People are like, “Do you use loops, or do you use your own MIDI?” I’m like, “Absolutely not.” Every time I create a track it is a new sequence for me, because every track is its own entity, and they’re all standalone. I’m not gonna go borrow from [one track] and put it in “Guantanamo.” That’s just ridiculous. When I create from the belly of the beast, that means that I am like a diamond. The diamond, before it becomes a diamond, you see this piece of coal, nobody pays attention to it. It’s just a piece of coal. Then all of a sudden it goes under this tremendous amount of pressure, and the pressure is not necessarily a bad thing. It’s just that in society, unfortunately in the society that we live in, when you say pressure, you think it’s bad. It’s not necessarily. Actually, for me, that pressure makes me a better person, it makes me a better artist. It’s a personal thing as well as a professional thing because I can’t even address the profession musically unless I address me personally. That’s what I mean when I say creating from the belly of the beast, having to face things about myself that I don’t like. Having to deal with me personally before I can create musically. I don’t create unless I do address those things. I go, and I will detox for months at a time, so that I can create. All of that is important to me, and that’s what I mean when I say creating from the belly of the beast. Creating from a space that is uncomfortable, but makes you a better person. Chal Ravens When you say detox, what do you mean by that? Jlin When I was creating the score for Autobiography, I went vegan for three months and I only drank water and I only ate fruit and vegetables. That’s all I did. I had to detox because I knew I didn’t wanna be... I wanted to be as toxin-free as I could while I was creating that. I’m gonna do the same thing when I create my third album. I think that process just works for me a lot better. Chal Ravens Let’s just rewind. A second ago you said about not reusing patterns from different tracks. It would be a good moment to talk about the 4D show that you’re putting on, because you were explaining to me before about quite the amount of work that it takes. Can you tell me what you were saying about what’s in a track? Jlin Yeah. I actually showed this on Instagram because sometimes, I don’t know if you guys know, I do these little Instagram Live things sometimes where I’m actually creating. I pulled up a track and I think it had... how many patterns? It had about 647 patterns, and there were about 900 or so sequences. All of my tracks are like that. The thing about it is, when I say that, if you listen to my work it doesn’t sound unbelievable because all of my stuff is so layered. I go through and make every last one of those sequences from scratch. I don’t go in and MIDI myself, and say, “Okay, I’m gonna snatch this MIDI, that MIDI, that MIDI, that MIDI.” No. That’s why it takes me so long to make a song. From start to finish it’s all freshly made. Chal Ravens And it’s intuitive, just as you’re going through that? Jlin Yeah. It is. It’s like a writer when they start a [novel]. What is their first sentence? As soon as I find that first sentence I can continue writing until I put the period on the end of it. Yeah. Chal Ravens For this 4D sound show, you’re having to go through all of these [sequences]. Jlin Yes. I had to break each one of those tracks down, which was... [laughs]. The thing about it was, I did it in three days, which realistically I should have probably done it in three weeks, but I did it in three days which was quite hectic. The reason I did it like that, my schedule is so hectic. Last year and this year was just ridiculous. Like I told you, I was on the road last year for 10 and a half months. Yeah. Chal Ravens This is why your 96-hour weeks built some stamina… Jlin Yeah. Chal Ravens We’re gonna hear one of the tracks that you did with Holly Herndon. Which one would you prefer? Jlin I like “1%.” Chal Ravens This is “1%” with Jlin and Holly Herndon. (music: Jlin & Holly Herndon – "1%") Jlin I forgot I liked that track. Chal Ravens Holly Herndon is another artist who, I guess, is quite concerned with breaking free of genre in some ways. She collaborates in quite conceptual ways. She uses technology. She’s very cutting edge with technology. You’ve known her for ages. Jlin Yeah. Me and Holly, that’s my sister right there. That’s the homey. Chal Ravens How did you find each other, and when was that? Jlin I had just finished “Erotic Heat” and she hit me up. She was like, “Hi, I normally don’t introduce myself to people, but my name is Holly Herndon and I just wanna tell you [...] I love this track,” and we just started like that. We kept in communication, and next thing I knew she’s like, “Hey, you know what. I’m just gonna shoot you some stems.” That’s when “Expand” came along. Chal Ravens “Expand” being New York Times’ number eight track of 2015. Jlin Yes. That came along. Chal Ravens Casual. Jlin I’m just joking. Yeah. That came into play. A lot of people don’t know, me and Holly were actually trying to go to Mills College together. We were trying to go, and she actually ended up going. I didn’t, but we were both trying to do that at the time. I think we just took a chance on each other. “Expand”, when we did that track, it was just one of those things where it was like, “Hey, I trust you, you trust me, let’s just work it out.” Chal Ravens What did you do? Just send files back and forth? Jlin Yeah, she literally just shot me a whole thing of files, and she was like, “I know you gonna think I’m weird, but I’mma just shoot you all of my stems.” It was a lot of stuff, it was actually so funny. Chal Ravens She picked the right person to deal with a lot of stems, right? Jlin Yeah, she definitely picked the right person. For sure. Yeah, then when we did “1%” it was basically... that actually was the weirdest thing, how that happened, because I was at her house, and sometimes when I’m here in Berlin me and Holly will go live on Instagram. People tend to freak out because usually I’m by myself. The last time we did it we both had on hoodies, and people were like, “Yo, is that Holly Herndon?” I’m like, “Yeah.” I was on my way out the door geared to go back to my hotel, and she’s like, “Hey, I’mma shoot you some stems. Do what you want with them.” I’m like, “Yeah, OK. I’ll put them on the album,” and then it actually really did come into play. So yeah, we just do that. Chal Ravens As someone who works on their own a lot, how important is it for you to have someone who knows you that well, and you can collaborate with still? Jlin It’s really important. Holly being one of the people who, if I could have a track with her on every album I probably would. I probably would. Holly’s one of my favorite artists, for sure. Not just because she’s my friend, but also because she’s such a conceptual [artist] and her usage of technology is just so genius. In such a way that only Holly can do, and nobody else can emulate what it is that she does. Sometimes it gets so intense that it’s like, I think even she gets confused sometimes because it’s just like, “Oh, shit, I didn’t mean for this to happen, but it sounds great.” Those are always happy moments for an artist, for sure. Chal Ravens Sometime around that point you were studying engineering. Jlin Yeah, I was in architectural engineering. I minored in math. Chal Ravens It kind of seems too obvious, but there’s something about architectural engineering that maps on, pretty strongly, with this. Like you were saying, maths and music ... Maths people are often music people in a certain way. How does that actually work when you’re in the studio? Do you find that you get lost in detail? How do you keep control of big picture? Jlin The big picture? You can get lost, but usually when I’m at the point where I get lost, I’m like, “OK, that’s it. I’m going to the movies. I need to go do something. I need to watch Scooby Doo. I need to do something.” That’s been my wind-down lately. I literally have bought every Scooby Doo episode from 1970 to 1973 because those were the best editions. When my mom was finishing high school. That is the way I unwind now. I literally watch Scooby Doo episodes, and I’m not afraid to say it. If you have a cartoon that you like to watch, I think you should watch it. Don’t be ashamed, guys. Chal Ravens This is a really straightforward question, but how long does it take you to make a track? Jlin Jesus Christ. “Guantanamo” was eight months. Eight months, with two different versions. The first version I absolutely hated. The second version, which is the one that you guys have, it took months to make that. That first overture track on Autobiography, which is the first track to the score, it took me a day and a half. It just depends on, honestly, what mood I’m in. When I created the track “Black Origami” it became an overwhelming thing. I have to walk out of the room many times so I can take a deep breath, and then come back and do it. I don’t know. For whatever reason, that track just made me overwhelmed. It’s just a moody thing, I think. Chal Ravens We’re gonna hear a track from Free Fall, which is the EP between the two albums, and we’ll explain why in a second. (music: Jlin – “BuZilla”) Jlin Oh boy. Chal Ravens I just want to quite quickly mention RP Boo at this juncture. This track is… Jlin That was dedicated to him. Chal Ravens It’s called “BuZilla”? Jlin Yeah. Chal Ravens It’s a tribute to a pivotal footwork track? Jlin Yeah. I’ve never heard anybody do a dedication track to an artist. Boo was definitely one of those people because he was definitely, at the time, in my life – still pretty much so, just very heavily at that time. For sure, I used to talk to him every day. Not just because of the help he gave me but also I loved the way he would put samples together. I specifically remember telling him I need the samples that he used in his track called “Release.” And then I needed the... I forgot the other track. It was two different tracks that I was like, “I need those samples ‘cause I wanna make this track.” He didn’t even know I was doing it. When he heard it, he was like, “Shut up. I had no idea you were doing that and that’s why you needed that stuff,” and his vocals... I just put it together and actually ended up being something... people were like, “What? That’s crazy! What?” Chal Ravens Tthe track that it’s attributed to is usually known as “The Godzilla Track.” Jlin Right. Chal Ravens It’s a track by RP Boo that is actually wrongly credited. Jlin It was initially wrongly credited, yeah, but it’s actually his track. Chal Ravens It is his track. Obviously it’s a Godzilla movie sample, but I believe he actually got it from the… Jlin That actually, I had to go really look for that sample because that was the original Godzilla sample. It was really hard for me. It took me three weeks to find it – the track was done, I just needed that Godzilla sample though. Chal Ravens ’Cause he just took his from the Pharoahe Monch track, which is much more convenient. I wanted to speak to you a bit about RP Boo ’cause like you say, he was a mentor to you, but I’m very wary of that framing of the young female artist with a male mentor, which can easily get a bit recycled by journalists. I know that he was quite instrumental in bringing you into the next stage, particularly with DJing? Jlin No. What happened was, as some of you guys may not know, when I was creating music I actually didn’t know how to perform at all. We won’t even talk about that phase, but I didn’t know how to perform, so I actually went to his house. I had one lesson of him teaching me how to DJ on the 1200s, actually. I figured out that this was nothing but a thing of timing and it was just a matter of my emotion catching up with my thinking. I went home and I bought the Numark Pro mixer, I think Pro 2 at the time. I went and got it and I was just practising, practising, practising. I just couldn’t get it for the life of me. And then he introduced me to this beautiful thing called cue points. From that point when he was like, “Yeah, you just set your cues and then that way you know where to come in, and then eventually you’re gonna get to a point where you don’t even need the cue points ‘cause you know your sounds so well. When I did get to that point, I was like, “Oh, wow! This is really easy.” What happened was, MUTEK festival in Montreal had a show and they were like, “Well, I know you DJ but this is really a show where you play live.” I was like, “OK.” They were like, “Well, do you wanna do it?” I’m like, “Well, I don’t know how to play live.” They were like, “But do you wanna learn?” I was like, “Yeah, OK!” I basically agreed to a show before I even knew how to play live, which I didn’t used to talk about, but it’s OK now! I agreed to a show and I didn’t even know how to do it. Then I got introduced to Ben Casey from Ableton. Ben took me under his wing. Immediately I said, “Ben, this is where I’m at. I gotta learn how to do this show. I got three weeks to learn how to perform live. Can you help me?” He’s like, “Oh, absolutely.” We would get on Skype call for a whole week and literally he showed me everything that I needed to do and we broke down my tracks and everything. It’s been a joyride ever since! [Laughs] Chal Ravens Three weeks to learn it. Jlin Yes. Everything in my life is like that – it seems like I have to learn it in three weeks, and they’re like, “Oh yeah, by the way, you have two hours to learn how to do this.” And it’s like, this is insane. But yes, way my life works. Chal Ravens I just wanna add that I can completely corroborate this story because, a while back I interviewed RP Boo and asked him this question. He said that he basically showed you the controller and you’re like, “OK, right, yeah.” You went away and three weeks later you came back and he was like, “You’re ready.” Jlin I called him. What happened is I called him on the phone and I was like, “I want you to listen to this.” We were talking about something totally different, had nothing to do... we were talking just like our normal conversations. I was blending while were talking and he’s like, “Do you realize that we went through 10 songs and you haven’t missed a beat?” He’s like, “You got it. You know how to DJ now. Go.” Chal Ravens So you didn’t need him. Jlin He literally was just like, “OK, go. You got it.” He said, “You absolutely had it.” I really appreciate him for that. To this day he’s always... if I need him he’s always there. Chal Ravens Do you feel like you’re in a position now where it’s your turn to be mentoring? Jlin I’m too silly to mentor anybody. Honestly, I’m serious. If you’ve ever seen me on Instagram live, I’m probably one of the silliest people I know. I will sit there and explain something in production and then go from doing that to talking about how Cancers are crybabies. I’m so silly! But no, honestly though, when a person does need something or if you ask me something, I will definitely explain it to you as much as I can. But as far as me actually mentoring somebody, I think I still have some growing up to do myself before I can go and sit down and say, “I’m gonna mentor this person.” Plus, I think if I mentor you, you gotta be crazy as hell anyway because I’m pretty crazy, I have to say. Chal Ravens Let’s play a track from Black Origami. I’ve got two here. Do you want “Holy Child,” or do you want “Kyanite”? Jlin Let’s do, “Holy Child.” Chal Ravens This is a collaboration… Jlin With me and William Basinski. Chal Ravens Maybe tee this up a bit, because William Basinski is not the first person you might think of to collaborate with. Jlin No [laughs]. Me and William met in LA at the Broad Museum. We had a show together, we just didn’t realize it at the time. I met him and I didn’t realize he was a legend at the time. When you’re young and you’re silly and you don’t research these things. I never look at the lineup. I’m like Serena Williams, when she plays, she never looks at who she’s playing – I never look at the lineup. I’ve also missed some great artists because of that too, because I haven’t looked. Chal Ravens He’s an ambient artist. Jlin He’s an ambient artist, so we’re what people would consider as far as the East is from the West. We met each other and I came down to watch him play. He played outside at this museum in LA and I was blown away. What I didn’t realize is that when it was time for me to play, he came up to watch my show. After I finished playing, he was the first person I saw after I played. He comes up to me, he grabs me and he hugs me and he says, “You know we’re gonna work together, right?” I was like, “What?” I remember telling my label, “Yeah, I met William Basinski and we’re gonna work together,” and they were like, “What?!” I’m like, “Yeah.” They’re like, “William wants to work with you?” and I’m like, “Yeah.” I didn’t understand at the time, but from my understanding it’s not something he does. It was an honor to have had that happen for sure. Chal Ravens Let’s just hear it first. Jlin OK. (music: Jlin – “Holy Child”) Jlin Thank you. I like that track ’cause I can hear the growth from what I was doing back then up until that point. “Holy Child” was a pivotal point for me just that I can hear, personally, myself. That and “Nyakinyua Rise,” those were two very pivotal points for me musically ‘cause I could hear the growth from Dark Energy until then. Chal Ravens How did you find common ground with William Basinski? What were you both doing? Jlin How we found common ground is, I think, out of all the collaborations that I have done up until this point, every last person who has collaborated with me has never micro-managed me. Because, I think they realize... not just with me but with anybody you work with, when you approach somebody I think you will get the best work out of that person if you don’t micro-manage them. They never micro-managed me. Like Holly, he gave me some stems and was like, “Go. I just wanna see what you can do.” He had no idea that it would come back sounding like that though. When I sent it to him, I remember he said, “I’m gonna listen to it.” I text him, I said, “OK, I sent you the track.” And he said, “I’ll let you know what I think.” I said, “Yeah, please do so.” I was sitting there for four minutes nervous as hell. The longest four minutes of my life. I remember he sent me this text back and it was in all caps: “CALL ME RIGHT NOW.” I was like, “Oh shit.” I called him and he was like, “This is one of the most epic things I’ve ever heard.” When he said that to me, I don’t know what I thought. I don’t know if I thought he started speaking another language or what happened, but I couldn’t believe that he liked it, ‘cause I loved it when I was done with it. But he was like, “This is amazing.” He was like, “This is why I trust you to do this,” he said, “because I wouldn’t just hand my work to anybody, but I really trusted you to deliver just like you did.” Chal Ravens Can you break down a bit more about how your style evolved on this album? The percussion in particular. Jlin The percussion in particular. I’m known for my percussion and the way that I use percussion. One of the reasons is I use percussion from all over – I use Indian percussion, I use African percussion, I use Brazilian percussion. Now I’m gonna start incorporating Persian percussion. I use taiko drums. I love percussion from all over the world. That is where the evolution of when my sound really started evolving, because I stopped using just certain things. I started going all over the diaspora, percussion-wise. That’s where I could hear the evolution of my sound starting to take shape where I could hear and say, “Ah, OK. Now I hear me now.” Even that is gonna evolve. That’s the whole beauty of it. I feel like if you ever wanna know if you’re doing it right, are you evolving, can you hear your growth? Because that is what’s important. Because if you can’t hear your growth, then you been sitting in the same spot for the last two albums or five years or whatever. It might be time to come out of your comfort zone. Chal Ravens Your next album is this ballet score, Autobiography. Jlin Well, it’s not really my third album but it’s the... Chal Ravens The next on the list. Jlin Yeah, yeah. Chal Ravens It’s out this month, right? Later this month? Jlin Yeah, on the 28th of this month, actually. Chal Ravens Plug. Jlin Plug! [Laughs] Chal Ravens It’s a score for ballet by Wayne McGregor, who is a very acclaimed choreographer and dancer. It was quite funny – I remember now that there’s this show on the radio in the UK called Desert Island Discs... it probably gets syndicated to other places. It’s on Radio 4 and it's maybe for older people having their breakfast on a Friday morning. He picked a Jlin tune as one of the tunes that he would not be without on a desert island. I loved the idea of my 80-year-old auntie playing Desert Island Discs on in the morning and turning off immediately. Can you tell us a bit about the ballet itself, Autobiography? Jlin Yeah. The autobiography is not your typical autobiography. It’s actually based on Wayne’s entire genome code, basically. He had got his entire reading back from a... I think the professor was from Harvard University, if I’m not mistaken. That’s what the ballet’s based on. That’s one of the most intimate things that you can... just that fact that he trusted me to do that. That’s such an intimate thing, your reading of your code of who you are as a being. Let me just start by saying that that’s a very intimate thing and I didn’t take it lightly. He actually had me read this book called... I can never think of the author’s name, but it’s called The Gene. I read it, and when I read it a lot of it made me feel different things. It made me understand why we’re in the state we’re in now for the most part, as far as society goes. With Wayne, it made me see him in a different light. When I first met him initially in downtown Chicago, we met face-to-face and we were talking. This was October of 2016 and we met face-to-face. When I met him, immediately I can tell his energy was just like mine. We just hit it off immediately... I asked him, “What do you want me to do?” He said, “I just want you to create. That’s all I want you to do.” He said, “This is the ballet, this is what it’s about. There’s the book; I want you to create. That’s it.” It was just that cut-and-dry. I’m like, “Well, there has to be more to it than that.” And he’s like, “No. I just want you to create.” So I did. Chal Ravens I know that there are several participants here who mentioned that they make music for theater. I just wondered, how does that change how you approach it? Are you thinking more visually? Jlin It changes you as an artist. It changes you because your approach changes. The way you see things changes. This ballet changed me as an artist, absolutely, because I hear differently now. I think differently, I see differently, my audio and my visual have become one instead of them being two separate things. It changes you. Chal Ravens You didn’t have a brief from him as such? Jlin No. As far as, did I know him before? His work? Chal Ravens As in, how strict were his instructions of what he wanted? Jlin No, that was it. He said, basically, “I want you to do you.” That was his instruction. And the reason being because, like I said before, I think if you trust an artist, and especially if you guys in here who create... Everybody’s artistic in some way whether you know it or not. But nothing is worse, I’m sure that all of you can relate, than when somebody’s standing over your shoulder micro-managing you. Because, if I trust you to do something – I’m looking at all you guys – if I trust you, especially if I initially approached you first and I trust you to do something, then I trust you to do it. I’m not gonna then stand over you and say, “Do this, this. A-B-C.” Because I’m not gonna get your best work if I’m micro-managing you. That’s the way Wayne was with me. That’s why he told me to just create, and the only person he wanted involved in me creating, was me and him. He didn’t want any middlemen whatsoever. I am so grateful for that, because you don’t get that a lot, especially in this industry. Most people, they say they want you to work, and then you get in the middle of a project, and then the project sometimes is shot to hell because you’re being micro-managed. There’s nothing wrong with taking direction. I get that. But when you’re looking at a person’s style and who their identity is and this is why you chose this person to work with, then trust them to be them. It saves a lot of time and a lot of emotion. Just trust that person to be themselves. Chal Ravens We’ve got a clip which is basically the music video to the single that you’ve got. But it also includes some of the dancing, so hopefully it will appear. (video: Jlin - “Abyss Of Doubt”) Jlin Wow. Chal Ravens Back in 2011 when people like Spinn and Rashad and RP Boo first came over to Europe to play footwork shows, the dancefloor was a mess – nobody knew how to dance to that. So I feel like we really made some progress here. What is it like to see people dancing to your music? Is there a feedback loop? Are you making music for people to dance to? Are you visualizing? Jlin I love movement, but when I say movement, that can be so broad, from the way that a person is sitting to the way that a person blinks their eyes, and the way that a person moves their hands when they talk. I love movement. For me, I didn’t start off creating so people could dance; I just really was inspired by just movement. I love watching a person in just their most human form. They don’t even realize what they’re doing, but they’re at their most innocent selves. I love when I see that, and so that’s one of the things that I like to create around, like spaces like that. When I was working with Wayne and when I actually got to meet the dancers, when I actually watched this, I was like, “Oh my God, this matches. This is so in sync, I can’t even begin to tell you how in sync it is.” These are the best dancers in the world. To be amongst them was such a high honor, and then Wayne being who he is. But the movement – when I see people in movement, I love it. I really love now when I see people who tag me on Instagram because they’ve seen this, they’re inspired now where they actually would tag me on Instagram – “Hey Jlin, I was dancing to your track.” “Hey Jlin, check this out.” They’ll either message me or tag me randomly that they were dancing. I love that I evoke that in different choreographers around the world. I think it’s a beautiful thing. Chal Ravens The other thing you did that was new for you on this score is you made some ambient pieces. Jlin Yes I did. Chal Ravens Which is getting out of your comfort zone with no drums there... Jlin Actually, it’s not even out of a comfort zone thing. That’s what I meant when I said the duality and versatility. I have always been that person, I just never displayed it until now. Chal Ravens It was quite convenient because you were able to send your very first ambient track to Basinski to check out. Jlin Yeah, I did! Yes I did. When I first sent it to him, he was like, “It’s beautiful, but let it breathe. Let the track breathe.” He said, “Let it do its thing.” When I went back and I listened to it, I knew exactly what he meant and I said, “OK.” When I sent it to him again, he’s like, “That’s what I’m talking about. Nailed it to a T.” Chal Ravens We’ll hear it. how long is it? Jlin It’s five minutes and eight seconds, I think. Chal Ravens Let’s see... Jlin I shouldn’t know my work like that, that’s so vain. Chal Ravens It’s five minutes and eight seconds. (music: Jlin – “First Overture Spiritual Atom”) Chal Ravens Thank you. So that track is “First Overture Spiritual Atom,” so it’s a sort of beginning. Jlin I’ve never even played an ambient track in front of people before, this was the first, so Red Bull got an exclusive. Chal Ravens Yeah it’s not out yet. Jlin No, it’s not out yet. Chal Ravens I just wanted to loop back to “The Abyss of Doubt” which is the track that was playing on the video. It’s got a sample in it from Carrie. Jlin Yes. Sam Beckett, too. Chal Ravens It’s the bit where someone says, “They’re all going to laugh at you.” Jlin Yes. Chal Ravens I don’t want to spoil Carrie, but maybe everyone’s kind of seen it now, but the plot of Carrie is that she is a high school student who gets her revenge. She is humiliated and she turns that humiliation into a pretty horrific revenge scene. And I feel like a lot of the music we’ve heard taps into a sense of rage and revenge perhaps. And particularly maybe a kind of female rage. You have this track “I Am the Queen”, where there’s the… Jlin It’s funny, because that track is not about me at all. Because everybody thinks it is. They’re like, “Is that about you?” And I’m like, no, actually it was a track dedicated to Crystal James, who was a footwork artist out of, she’s a footwork dancer, out of Chicago. And that’s dedicated to her because she’s my favorite footwork dancer. Chal Ravens “Abyss of Doubt”? Jlin No, “I Am The Queen”. That’s dedicated to her. Yeah. Chal Ravens But there’s a lot of powerful, potentially vengeful sounding emotions in several of the tracks that we’ve heard. I kind of wondered what makes you angry? Jlin What makes me angry? Oh boy. Everything these days. No, actually, I guess I don’t consider my work to be angry. I think it’s just, I think I have a boldness to my sound. So I think it comes out. There’s a boldness about me personally. And I think it just exerts audibly. It’s not that I mean for it to be angry or any of that. Actually I don’t see it as angry at all, I just see it as me just kind of... I guess maybe the sounds that I choose to use, I guess they would sound angry and they’re not playful or jolly in a way. But I don’t think it’s anger. I really do just think it’s me creating from the core of myself, but I don’t find it to be angry, because I find it to be a very, just you know... sharing I guess. I think what happens is, I’ll be honest with you, when I first initially came out, especially like when “Erotic Heat” and all this stuff came out, for two years everybody thought I was a guy. Because of the way that my music sounds. They just naturally assumed that I was a guy. And then when they found out that I was a woman, I remember, I’ll never forget Rashad saying to me, he said, “Well shit, out of the 12 men that’s in the room, Jlin knocks 10 of them out by herself.” And you know I didn’t mean to, but that is the way that, you know. I never meant it to be like such a masculine or a feminine thing. I just meant it to be a me thing. And, you know, that’s the way I create. Chal Ravens Yeah, I mean maybe there’s a sense of when a woman makes music that’s like that, it gets read into more deeply. Jlin Completely. Like it definitely gets gone into, like it becomes... automatically because this is already such a male-dominated genre, it just kind of... When I first started, I just automatically got placed into this, “Oh yeah, Jlin is a guy...” I mean people used to actually write me and be like, “Man, that’s an awesome track, bro. What’s up bro?” And I’m just like, “Hey.” And then I’m like, “I’m a woman.” Chal Ravens I think as well there is a tendency to, with writers and so on, to assume that when women make music it’s autobiographical. And confessional. And that men don’t have that responsibility to only be themselves. They can speak for others as well. Jlin Right, exactly. So I had to go into that phase, and then it almost went into the phase of like... I mean I’ve dealt with it, and I try not to dwell on it, but at the beginning, it’s not like that now, but I was definitely hit with that chauvinism. “Man, you make good tracks for a girl.” And it’s like, what does that even mean? And then like nine times out of 10, the person who said that to you, you go, “Do you even make music?” “Oh no, actually I don’t.” It’s like, I think that’s a ridiculous statement. Chal Ravens On a possibly related note, you mentioned this as something that you were interested to talk about – a topic that’s come up frequently recently is the relationship between musicians and their own mental health. And things that happen to musicians in their daily life when they’re touring 10 months out of a year can make it a bit difficult. Jlin Yeah. Chal Ravens And I wanted to ask you first of all, what do you think puts musicians at risk in terms of their own mental health? Jlin I think one of the things that puts us at risk is that we say yes more than we should. That’s one. I definitely think we say yes more than we should. And also too, it doesn’t help when you get to a place, because this has often happened to me, where I literally almost was like “Yo, I’m about to fly back home because I’m not…” You know, we’re not assembly line performers. We have feelings too. We get tired. We get emotional. Because we’re on the road and we are traveling so much we live in airports. We have feelings too. We also have a breaking point. You know I’m not just a little jack-in-the-box that every time you wind me up, I pop out and play. And that’s what a lot of people don’t understand. I might have had a show at two o’clock in the morning, finish playing at three, and my flight is at six. And then I’m expected to then come into soundcheck. My flight is two hours and then soundcheck is at 11 o’clock. I never slept the night before. And we’ll do that night after night after night after night. That’s how a lot of times artists end up on drugs, simply because they’re trying to stay awake. So I’ve learned to say no, because the word no can save your life. I’ve even had to apologize to promoters and people – well, not even just the promoters but people who have had to come and pick me up from the airport because I’m so tired, and I’m so grumpy, you know, and it’s not their fault. They’re just coming to pick you up, you know. And I have had to say “I am so sorry, it’s just that I haven’t slept. Like, I literally have done this three nights in a row, back to back.” But you’re there to do a show. And that’s great. You do the show, you perform the show, you get through it. But see a lot of times, your immune system now is so low because you haven’t slept. You’re so tired. You’re exhausted. I mean I just came from Uganda. I just got in yesterday. You have to take that time out where you say “OK, I need a day.” So now what I do is if I have a show I always make sure I’m there the day before the show, so then I have a whole day’s time to rest. Then I can go into the show and then fly and do that whole process. Because it was just too hard, you know it’s too hard. Like if you’re doing a back-to-back and you just got like one or two off and then that’s it, it’s OK. But you have to take care and make sure you put you first. You have to know when to stop. You have to know when to create. When to sit still. And I don’t mean any disrespect to anybody in the room, you know, but drugs are not the answer. They’re just not the answer. And you can take as many as you want, you are a human being. At the end of the day when those drugs wear off, you’re still a human being, and you are not Superman or Superwoman. You have to take that time for yourself. It is so imperative that you take that time for yourself. Chal Ravens And have you kind of worked out little routines, little tips and tricks to kind of keep you in the… ? Jlin Oh yeah. Like now, like just with the way that I plan logistically as far as the shows that I pick. Like I’m not going to ... I was doing it crazy last year because I would fly home, sometimes I would fly home just for three days just to get peace of mind so I could come back out on the road. But now what I do is, one of my favorite places in Europe [where] I love to stay is in Krakow. So when I’m in Europe I have this one Airbnb that I love to stay in, so I’ll stay in that Airbnb, and I’ll stay there for a week and I’ll just rest. I mean, I just love the city of Krakow to be honest. And so, you know, I take that time for myself. I rest. I read. Meditating is a big one. Just sitting still and saying “It’s OK.” Like when I’m in town, especially when I’m in Berlin... I hate to say it, but I’m sure a lot of you guys kind of know it, it’s kind of like the ongoing joke now that every artist lives in Berlin. Even when I’m here, I’m hesitant to tell people that I’m here because everybody wants to hang out. And sometimes I just have to say no. Like I just I need I need a minute to myself. Like I said, every person is an artist in a room and creative in their own space. We are not jack-in-the-boxes. It’s OK to say no. If you need to take a nap, take a nap. Like to me, naps answer everything. Take a nap. Chal Ravens I was going to ask, finally, if you had any advice for younger self. But maybe it’s take a nap. Jlin No, for my younger self, if I had to give myself advice, it would be to embrace your failure. Definitely embrace your failure because that is… Your failure is more important than your success. You have to fail. And I will give any artist that advice. Anybody who’s doing anything that they are trying to better themselves or trying to sculpt and craft, you have to... that failure is so much more important than your success. I’m sure you guys have seen the picture where there’s an iceberg that’s sitting at the top of the water and then all that ice runs so deep under the water. Well, what’s important is that ice that’s under the water that you don’t see. So many times we talk to people who are you know, on a platform, and you talk to them. But everybody only wants to talk about their success. Nobody wants to talk about the failure that they had to go through to get to that point. I still have failures. I still go through some of the craziest things. I mean you have failures within yourself whether it be personally or professionally or whatever. I mean you have them. And acknowledge them, understand that those are learning experiences, and they make you a better person. And I hate the way that society identifies failure because it means, it almost becomes an instant gratification thing. If it didn’t happen you failed. No, the only time you fail is when you make a conscious decision to stand still and be stagnant. That is the only time you’re failing. Any other time other than that, you are making a step towards what you’re trying to do. And if I could tell younger me that, I would tell me that, and I would tell you guys that. Embrace your failures. There’s nothing wrong with it. We live in a society where every other person has anxiety. And you can look at the world, and I hate to say it, but shit, if you don’t have anxiety, I almost question what world do you live in? But you know, it’s just that: embrace your failures. Because they’re so important to you. They really are. And like I said, you’re not failing. You’re not standing stagnant. You are doing what you’re supposed to do. It just didn’t happen when you thought it should. But that doesn’t mean stop. Keep going. Please keep going. Because I never would have thought that I would be in this position, first of all, to sit ... From an artist that went from their bedroom – who still makes music in their bedroom, as you guys some of you guys know – to be sitting in front of you having this conversation, this is an intimate thing. This is not just a production or something or an academic learning experience. This is real life. Hell, I sit down and it takes me hours upon hours to create. And don’t let these like silly ass YouTube videos [fool you], where an artist sits down and in two minutes they have a whole track. That’s not even realistic. What they didn’t show you were the edit cuts that they took out. But you know, that’s real life. I love settings like this where you can sit down and have real conversations with people. Because it’s so important. We have to talk to each other. We have to communicate with each other. It’s so important. The other person doesn’t know that I might be, “Yo, I’m going through the same thing too. But you’re the first person I ever heard talk about it.” This is real life. An embrace it. Because we’re all going through it. We’re all evolving. And you know like I said, I really appreciate every last one of y’all coming out here. Because it’s important to me. I mean, I know what I know, but this is a learning experience for all of us. And I’m grateful to like every last one of y’all for coming out and sharing this with me. Chal Ravens Yeah. Go forth and fail. Jlin Yes please. Chal Ravens Thank you very much, Jlin. Jlin Thank you. Thank you. Chal Ravens OK, who has a question? Audience Member Hi. Jlin Hi. Audience Member Thank you for everything you’ve said, it’s nice to hear. Jlin Oh, thank you. Audience Member I was wondering if you had any advice, like now that we’re on the subject of failing and this idea of micr-omanagement in collaboration, and all these things coming up – we’re doing this thing and we’re two weeks in this place, and we have lectures, and we have interviews, and all these new things. And we’re also meant to collaborate with each other in the spare time. It’s a bit difficult to know how to make space, to actually get to know the people you’ll be collaborating with and to figure out how you’ll do that, without it just being about the pressure. Jlin In a situation like that – I’ve been in situations like that before, too. In that setting, the best thing that I could tell you for both parties, you and whoever you’re collaborating with, is to be authentically yourself. Always be authentically you. Don’t ever, you don’t have to adapt to somebody else’s. Be authentically yourself. Especially creatively. If you’re not feeling something, don’t go along with it and say it’s cool because it’s such and such. Like, I don’t give a damn who it is. It could be whoever. Like I mean if I was doing something with Madonna and I just wasn’t feeling it, I would have to tell Madonna, “I’m not feeling this.” I mean, honestly, you know, I’m not going to roll with it because of who it is. Even I love Sade, but you know I’m not going to go with something, or like something, because it’s Sade. You have to be authentically yourself. Always choose that first. And that’s how I would say, how to come into that. Audience Member Thank you. Jlin You’re welcome. Chal Ravens I think there was one there. Audience Member Hi. Jlin Hi. Audience Member First of all, thanks for sharing your wisdom. It blew my mind. Your music, I didn’t know it before, and it absolutely blew me away. Jlin It’s an honor, thank you for coming. Thank you. Audience Member Thank you. And I wonder if you could share with us if you had any like spiritual practice. I know it’s a very personal question. Jlin No, I do. I do, yeah. Audience Member Do you have any spiritual practice that you do, especially on a daily basis, but also before starting to work on music? Jlin Yeah, I’ve actually talked about this before. I talk to my ancestors daily. I do. I talk to my ancestors. I know that might sound crazy to some of y’all but I definitely talk to my ancestors. I talk to Nina Simone. I talk to Eartha Kitt. I talk to my grandmother. Just asking for, I just need guidance. What am I supposed to do? I definitely practice spirituality. I have a stone that I’m wearing right now which is onyx. I got it made in Israel. And it promotes protection and creativity and productivity. And I got it blessed before it was sent to me. So yeah, I definitely practice. I’m not a religious person. But I definitely practice spirituality. Some of the track titles of my music are very spiritual things. So yeah, definitely, for sure. Even when I meditate, the things that I focus on... There’s no harm in just taking a spiritual moment for yourself. I have a thing where I say there’s a fine line between my vulnerability and your entertainment. Because I’m not just up there performing. I’m not just creating music. It’s also a very spiritual thing that’s happening as well. You’re welcome. Chal Ravens One more? Audience Member Hi. Jlin Hi. Audience Member Thank you. I had the pleasure of listening to a set of yours in Athens. Jlin Oh, haha. Yeah. Audience Member Yeah, in the church. It was beautiful. Jlin Thank you. Audience Member And I was wondering, because especially in the live set, but now as well, I felt that there was a lot of humor in the way you changed from a song to the other. And I am just wondering because I feel that there is a lot of political comments of how you use the sound. There are politics involved. I can see that. You said that you start a song from the beginning and just go through... how important is the narrative for you? Jlin The narrative is... I have a thing that I abide by. It’s called CPU, which stands for clean, precise and unpredictable. That is the narrative that I abide by. That when I create, I have to create in that aspect. Nothing sucks more than when you just hear ... Like, you know an artist, so you see them, and you’re just like, “I know exactly what to expect from this person.” But for me, when I start a track or when I start that sentence of that track, that is the most important. Because that opens up a totally different world of what I can do. That’s why I say every track that I make is a standalone. Because they’re not like this in sync thing. They really do each have their own body, their own energy. And so that’s why the narrative is so important for me in the sense of having that freedom to work within an infinite amount of space, and not a constrained... There’s not like a... what is the word I’m looking for? Like a restriction on where I will and won’t go. And so yeah that’s what’s important to me. Yeah. Audience Member Same. Jlin Thank you. Chal Ravens One more? Audience Member Hey. Jlin Hi. Audience Member I think your work is incredible. When I first heard it I was blown away. I was like, this sounds so fresh and so new. Jlin Thank you. Audience Member I have a kind of boring music production question. But it ties in with this mentality that you’re talking about and this unique individual approach. You put up a thing in your Facebook saying producers need to stop putting their kicks on the one. I saw that and… Jlin Yes. OK. Yeah. That is definitely something that I like. “Holy Child,” that entire track, all the kicks are off beat. None of them are on beat. And I specifically wanted it that way. Yeah, you don’t have to put the kick on the one. You know? I feel like space is infinite to create. So why not use it? It doesn’t have to be based on, OK, the kicks should be on one, or it should just be boom, boom, boom. But it’s just like, OK guys. We can do so much more than that. It’s just that, like I said, you know when it’s trendy, and this is what’s making people move. Nothing aggravates me more than when I’m in the space – well, these are one of the things that aggravate me. When I’m in the space, and then it’s like you’re waiting for the drop to happen and then it actually happens. I just get so pissed off. I’m like… “Why?” Audience Member What I was curious about is that I feel like there’s been this huge resurgence in like triplets, in rhythm, in dance music. Jlin Mm-hmm. Audience Member And I feel like when I first heard your stuff, I was like, holy shit, she takes triplets to a whole new place that I didn’t even know that it could go. Jlin I love threes. I love threes. I love sixes too. Audience Member Yeah. And I was wondering what was the... Because I feel like listening to you stuff, sometimes there’s not a definite pulse you can latch onto, but there is more of a sense of sixes and threes than fours. Jlin Mm-hmm. Audience Member And what drew you to using that instead of fours? Jlin I got tired... I think there’s only so much I can do within four. I got tired of working in four. I know how to work in four. Even with Autobiography there are tracks that I work in four, but even then I know how to take it. It may be in four but it doesn’t sound like the traditional four. I take it out of that traditional form of four. And I jus got tired of working within four, honestly. I was just like, OK, this is just not working for me. It’s just one of those things that became robotic, like, “OK. There has to be more to it than this.” That’s just me speaking. It’s no disrespect to anybody that works with four. 98% of my friends work in four. But I think that’s why it’s refreshing to hear when somebody does something different from the norm. That’s why I always tell a person when they’re like, man, that was the best set I’ve ever heard. And it’s like, no, actually, it’s just that you’ve been listening to the same thing for the last six hours. And it’s been five different artists. We can do it better. You know what I’m saying? I like when people become innovative and they challenge themselves more. That’s part of why I put those production tips up like that, just to give a person, to open their world a little bit more. And just based off of the things that I’ve learned, and taught myself. I’m still learning too, I’m just like y’all. I am not a master at any of this, that’s why I’m not ready to be nobody’s mentor, because I’m too damn silly. But it’s just like you know, I’m not a master at this, but the things that I do know, I’m always willing to share, and you know, yeah. Chal Ravens We’ll just have the final one. Jlin Yeah, for sure. Audience Member Hi. Jlin Hi. Audience Member It was really a pleasure listening to you today. Jlin Thank you. Audience Member I think I speak for all of us. And I wanted to ask you about a specific track we heard, “Guantanamo”, you said it had a previous version. I was wondering what you didn’t like about the first version? And also because I know sometimes when you finish a track and you don’t like it, it’s very hard to start over or to change some of the things. So how did you manage to do that? Jlin With “Guantanamo”, what I didn’t like about it first of all, with the first version, was I just felt like it wasn’t doing enough. I wasn’t feeling it at all. It has some good spots, but then I was just like, it’s not that impact that I like. Because I am my hardest critic. All of you guys in this room could tell me something sounds great, and if I hate it, I just hate it. Nobody can convince me otherwise So when I went and redid the second version, I started it – that’s why it took me eight months to do it, because I walked away from it for a long time and then I went back to it. Because I knew it had good aspects, but then I also had to grow as an artist too. My hearing matured. And then I was able to go back and create that second version. I’m like “OK, I like this a lot better, now it’s that feeling that I’m looking for.” The feeling that I’m evoking even before it hit y’all, for me. Because if I’m not feeling it, y’all not going to hear it. Like if I don’t like it, you guys won’t hear it. And I’ve had many of those, where I was just like, “This isn’t going to work.” Audience Member Yeah, I want to go further into the four and the three and the sixes in rhythm. Jlin Yeah. Audience Member What do you think about [the fact] we all work on the computer like in the grid? Jlin Yeah, you work in the grid. Audience Member And also with scales, like 12 tones in one octave. Jlin Yeah, I work in the grid too. Audience Member What do you think [about] working with the rhythm that is not in the grid. Jlin I’ve worked with the rhythm that’s not in the grid. “Holy Child” is not in a grid at all. That was the hardest track I’ve ever made. There’s also a track that is very difficult that I made that’s also on Autobiography called “Carbon-12”. It’s very difficult because I wasn’t working in a grid whatsoever. So you can work within the grid and still be in an infinite space, let me just say that. This is where math comes into play. You have permutation and combination. Endless combination, endless permutation. So you can transform a sound and drive a sound as many times as you like. A lot of times when I’m producing, when I’m making a track, a lot of times I may use the same sound 20 times but you didn’t know it, because it sounds different every time. So you create the infinity up here first [taps head]. Damn the grid that’s on the computer, who gives a shit about the grid. You be in your infinite space up here. And then create. That’s how I create. Yeah. Chal Ravens I’m glad we had that question. Again, give it up for Jlin. Jlin Thank you.

Title: The Granular Convolver

The Granular Convolver
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Red Bull Music Academy in Berlin, Tatsuya Takahashi, Christoph Hohnerlein and Maximilian Rest collaborated on a brand new musical device, the Granular Convolver, which was given to each of the participants attending the Academy. As Korg’s former chief engineer, Takahashi has been responsible for some of their most exciting products in recent years, including the Monotron, Minilogue and Volca series. Hohnerlein is a DSP engineer specializing in the field of auditory perception, while Rest is the co-founder of E-RM Erfindungsbüro, a Berlin-based hardware manufacturer specializing in high-quality MIDI sync devices. In 2017, Rest and Takahashi first collaborated on a synthesizer project for Ryoji Ikeda’s [A For 100 Cars] as part of Red Bull Music Festival Los Angeles 2017.
In this public conversation at Red Bull Music Academy 2018 in Berlin, Takahashi, Hohnerlein and Rest discussed the what, why and how of this unique instrument.
Hosted by Tatsuya Takahashi Today we’re gonna be presenting the Granular Convolver. As I already stated, it’s a device that was made especially for the participants of the Red Bull Music Academy, which is now taking place in Berlin. It’s actually the second time that me and Max collaborated. The first was last year’s show in LA, it was called A [For 100 Cars]. It was a composition by audiovisual artists Ryoji Ikeda and we made 100 sine wave generators, each with a different frequency, and we played them back through 100 cars with stupidly big soundsystems and we made a big drone piece. [speaker holds up sine wave generator] Conveniently, it has a timer on here so we can keep track of where we are in this lecture. I don’t know, do you wanna talk about... I don’t actually know how you guys met or what you worked on before but... Christoph Hohnerlein I know Max since, I don’t know, eight years? Roughly. Maximilian Rest Eight years, nine years, maybe. Christoph Hohnerlein We met in university, as undergrads, doing electrical engineering. We started studying back then together and then kept on working on several projects... Maximilian Rest We did some research together as well, and we went together for our... For our degrees we went to Stanford, to CCRMA and did research after this together and collaborated on different projects and synthesis, DSP. Tatsuya Takahashi Any in particular? Maximilian Rest There’s one in particular. Yeah, there’s one in particular which is not too public yet, but yeah, we’re working on something. Tatsuya Takahashi Oh OK, Sorry. Christoph Hohnerlein It also makes sound. Maximilian Rest I just brought Chris in ’cause we’ve been working together for some time in the last years, and it’s the team that made the Convolver. Tatsuya Takahashi And also we have on the left here Mari Matsutoya, who is a multidisciplinary artist. She works in the field of technology embodiment and gender. Actually she’s done a collaboration with Laurel Halo on using the Hatsune Miku Vocaloid. Another thing she does is she takes apart electronic devices on stage and then puts them back together again. So this is her Granular Convolver rendition of that performance and this will be taking place in the background as we give this lecture. [screen next to speakers shows a top-down view of her performance throughout] So, I’d like to explain what this thing actually is. So it’s called a Granular Convolver because it is a combination of granular synthesis and a mathematical process called convolution. This came about because... Well firstly, I wanted an excuse to build something, and so I was thinking what can we build that would be especially made for the academy participants... Maximilian Rest And it should be a dub siren. Tatsuya Takahashi Yeah, it could be a dub siren. And thank God we didn’t make a dub siren because... Or any kind of synthesizer because it would have had a certain sound and we didn’t want to make something that would impose a certain sound or a certain tone that everybody had to work with. So the challenge was, “How do we make an instrument that doesn’t have a voice?” That instead you would have to give it that voice. So the obvious thing was to work with samples but obviously we have a million samplers out there, both in hardware and software. The next idea was, “Why don’t we use samples and do granular synthesis with it?” But then it would kind of sound like granular synthesis, so I was kind of stuck there when Max mentioned, for a complete different project, that we should use convolution. And convolution, in broad terms, is a way of combining two sounds together. People usually associate convolution to reverb processing, but actually it’s just a way of combining two sounds together and matching the spectrum and picking out the bits that are common to both sounds. So it’s a way of marrying two sounds together and coming up with a new sound that sounds like both of the two original sounds, but is actually very different as well. So I was thinking, maybe if we can have sampling, and we can have granular synthesis, where we can really zoom in the sample and pick out the bits that sound interesting, and then what if we can convolve that with another sound that’s coming in in real time? And it could be anything, and it could work for people who aren’t synth geeks, it could work with people who are instrumentalists, vocalists, drummers, and it would be something that everyone would be able to use. So, this is what it looks like [speaker holds up Granular Convolver] and you can record 20 slots in here by choosing the slots, and it’s best illustrated by actually recording a sample. [speaker connects Granular Convolver to microphone] So I’m gonna record the cymbal now. [speaker hits cymbal] And we can play it back. OK. Here it is. The granular bit is you can slice a small fragment of that sample. And we have two controls, we have the grain size, which is the size of that fragment, and we have the position, which is where in that sample you pick this fragment out from. So we can preview the grain. [Granular Convolver makes short, stuttering sound] And by changing the position within that sample we can pick out specific parts of that sample. So the attack portion would be that bit. And as we move through the decay we can hear the high frequencies dying away. [speaker scrubs Granular Convolver through the recorded sound] Like so. But we’re stilling just listening to the grain right now. The idea is to convolve something else with it. So in this example, I will connect a contact mic and start convolving. [speaker attaches contact mic to Granular Convolver and begins tapping it with his finger] So right now, we’re convolving what this pickup is picking up from me hitting it, and this excites the sample. And if I tap on it with my nail, you get more of the highs. If I tap it with my finger, you don’t get so much. Maybe if I... [taps gently on mic] It’s very quiet. So we can get different expressions or different versions of the cymbal sound according to what input we put inside it. We’ll be showing more sound demos later in conjunction with a bit more of a detailed explanation of what convolution actually is. So this was sent out to all of the academy participants. If you don’t know about the academy, you can go around and see the studios where it happens in this building. We have 60 participants coming from 38 different countries and the idea was to send these out to them before they come to Berlin and to collect sounds from home and have a different kind of level of communication and of language to collaborate and work on new sounds together. So these were sent out with these pickups courtesy of Korg, and these mics courtesy of Audio-Technica. And so they came in and we just finished the first sound and they have been doing some pretty crazy stuff with them. It was really important that this was a handheld device. I think it’s the first time that this has taken the form of a hardware device. It’s battery powered, so you can go around and you can pick up sounds. Although there’s a USB circuit here, it’s just for power, it’s not for loading samples into this unit. So the whole point of this was that you have to be in the physical presence of sound to capture it. Also, with regards to the controls, you can see on the screen there, as Mari takes this apart, all these controls have been custom made for this project. All made in Berlin actually, amazingly. Each one, I don’t know if you can see it on the screen, is laser-engraved on the back with the name of each of the participants. So this, at the same time as being an instrument, it’s kind of like a letter to the participants to say, “Hey, check this out.” And also the form that it takes, the big knob, this is my way of thinking about making instruments, is that it actually needs to unfold into an experience where it’s saying stuff to you. It needs to speak to you. This big thing is big because you want the resolution and you want the detail when you’re navigating through the sample. The grain size is on a slider because you maybe wanna do fast cuts. The longer the grain, the more ambient the sound is, the shorter the grain, it sounds more like a filter. So these things were all taken into account when designing this thing. And also, we really wanted to strip it down to the bare minimum. We had ideas about adding a filter to the output, or some kind of compression to the output to make it easy to use, but at the same time we were thinking, “What the hell do we know? These participants will come in, they will all use it in their own ways.” So we were like, “Yeah, let’s keep it open, let’s keep it very simple. Two controls. And just be open to what people do with it.” Maximilian Rest Just to add, because were weren’t sure what people come up in terms of the sounds, right? How people would use this technique, we had no clue before how to... Tatsuya Takahashi Yeah, exactly. I mean, some things that we might think is right will be in the complete wrong direction of what other people might wanna do with it. Which is why it’s just cut a grain and convolve, and that’s it. And also, the actual industrial design reflects that. We’ve got no surface treatment. These are made from sheet stainless steel. This is before, when it’s just been laser cut. [speaker holds up cut piece of sheet metal] and before it’s been folded into a box. No surface finish, this is the way they buy the material and it’s got this matte gray, metal feel to it. All these knobs that are machined, as is, with all the machining marks. So it has that kind of pure, kind of raw feel to it. So that was very important again in conveying this message, to speaking to the users. Should we talk about what’s inside? Max, you can talk about the nuts and bolts? The guts? Maximilian Rest Yeah, I think we are far enough to see some of the insides, the guts of the Convolver. Can you imagine the Convolver to be a shrinked down, full computer with a MIDI controller in front of it. The computer itself has just been taken out there. [speaker references what’s happening on the screen] It’s a green little chip there in the middle, between the cable and the board. [speaker moves over to the screen] And the other board is actually the full computer. It’s a computer with 4 GHz, it’s a Raspberry Pi that’s running the audio algorithm on it. That’s a board we designed which contains a soundcard and a differential mic input, and a board in here is the board which takes over all of the controls and manages all the knobs and buttons and LEDs and power management. I said it’s a computer and a MIDI controller. A midi controller is actually this, [points to controller on screen] and there’s a microprocessor which takes care of power management between battery and USB. All the LEDs, all the shutdown and power-on sequences, all the buttons, and then sends MIDI to the other board, to the computer, to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is actually running Linux, custom Linux that we made for this guy, that boots up quickly ’cause you don’t wanna wait for 30, 40 seconds, 50 seconds for the Convolver to start. The computer is connected to the soundcard and this is where the whole audio stuff happens. Audio in goes into the computer, is processed, and goes out again. You can imagine this like your DAW, your computer, and between input and output we placed a software called SuperCollider, open-source software, which is operating a script. You can imagine it’s like a plugin between input and output that processes all the sound and runs the algorithm, which is controlled by the interface, which we have here. Tatsuya Takahashi So the board on the bottom there is basically what you might call a MIDI controller, right? And it actually sends MIDI over the cable to the other board. Maximilian Rest Exactly. Yeah. It’s all based around open-source software, basically. I’ve been talking to someone, an older engineer recently, who said that 20, 30, 40 years or 30 years ago, it was so hard to get access to these specialized chips and DSP power and computer power. All of this stuff, it’s all there now. We were just able to do this project in such a fast time because we had access to all these building blocks. We just set together a couple of building blocks, which is this ARM processor which does all of the low-level stuff, all the power stuff. And it’s all documented and there are communities around this, and there is forums and there are tutorials and application notes. And the same for the Raspberry Pi. It’s a special version of the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is like a tiny computing platform with a powerful processor. This is the slimline version, the compute module. It just goes into this little socket up there. And all the stuff is just there, and all the documentation is freely available. And there was a real benefit in this architecture that we could set it on. Christoph Hohnerlein One great advantage to us having full Linux on there is that it runs all the software that you know from a normal full-size Linux, obviously. Which allows for super rapid prototyping. Which allowed me then to try out things quickly. What works, what... Maximilian Rest Right. Right. So SuperCollider is cross platform. SuperCollider would also run on your Mac. SuperCollider is a scripting language to script how you want to process sound. It ran on Chris’s Mac and it ran on my Linux machine and it ran as well on this tiny little computer, so the workflow was pretty well defined from the beginning. I was programming and developing the embedded stuff for the MIDI controller, and Chris would just do the SuperCollider on his Mac because the Raspberry Pi part wasn’t ready yet. But he could just start developing and we just agreed on a specification to communicate between the layers over MIDI, and then he could just use his Mac to write the script and just get the DSP ready. And when the other stuff was ready, we just joined everything. Tatsuya Takahashi I think it’s a great time to be building stuff, right? So we have to worry less about building the small details and making it work, and we can worry more about the creative implications of what we are doing. I think more and more access to this kind of technology has first of all, made it easier to use... Maximilian Rest Definitely. Tatsuya Takahashi ... But it also means that you have more time to worry about how it’s done and what it’s doing and the creative side of using that technology. I think it’s a really good example of that, actually, this project. Christoph Hohnerlein Yeah. Definitely. Tatsuya Takahashi Using the means and the resources that people have now. And I guess things like Max for Live, if you own Ableton, it’s in there. You can either build your own instruments or use other people’s instruments. And I think it’s a really interesting time if you’re a musician, or a visual artist, or to have this access to this technology because you can do some really cool stuff without having the skill or the knowledge of all the details. And you can work in a macro state. I think it’s really great. Maximilian Rest And you don’t even have to design your custom hardware. There are boards or kits out there where you have audio in and everything. You don’t have to do all the work to engineer your own device. That’s all out there. And I think there’s another nice benefit. The thing, the Convolver, in this state, is completely open and hackable. I would encourage everyone that has one to screw it open and read the instructions on the back. Because you can just connect to it and change your convolver or whatever your convolver does. Tatsuya Takahashi Into a dub siren? Maximilian Rest Into a dub siren, yeah. Christoph Hohnerlein You can check out what we’re doing on it. You have actual access to the code if you snoop around a bit. Maximilian Rest Yeah. Tatsuya Takahashi Shall we talk about what convolution actually is? Maximilian Rest Yeah, what is convolution? Tatsuya Takahashi What is convolution?! Christoph Hohnerlein A great time. Well... Tatsuya Takahashi But before we talk about that, we need to explain what is sound, right? Christoph Hohnerlein Well, I guess. At least a specific representation. Luckily, we have something prepared. Since we’re already using our screen. [Tatsuya holds up a large graph] All right. OK, so, if you remember, we recorded the hit on the cymbal, just before. And then, we picked out a little grain. And more or less, you could imagine this grain that we played back, this little hit that you heard before, can be represented in this kind of way. Which I assume most of... Or some of you are familiar with is the spectrum. Tatsuya Takahashi Should we listen to the cymbal? Maximilian Rest Yeah. We can listen. Tatsuya Takahashi Can you play that back? Maximilian Rest Yeah. So... Tatsuya Takahashi Yeah. Let’s listen to the cymbal. Christoph Hohnerlein So, this sound. [recorded cymbal sound plays] Tatsuya Takahashi But if you listen closely, there’s a high bits. Christoph Hohnerlein So, yeah. All right. So essentially, you can break up the sound into the so-called spectrum, right? And you have low frequencies, mid frequencies, high frequencies. Low frequency would be your bass. Mid frequencies would be voice, guitar and so on. High frequencies, hi-hats and essentially any sound you can split up into this. And then, the higher you go, the louder that specific area in that sound is. And with this cymbal recording, for example, we obviously have a lot of energy in the highs because it’s a very percussive sound. But we also have some interesting pattern down here. [points to the low-frequency parts of the graph] And you could just think of this as a representation of how this sound actually sounds to your ears, right? You have quite a bit of highs and little bit of lows. So now, if you think about what does convolution actually do... I’ve got some more toys down here. [speaker picks up another graph] White noise. So if you play all the sounds, all the frequencies at the same time at the same loudness, you get something like this. [Max makes white noise sounds on the Granular Convolver] This is so-called white noise. Right, so. This sound has lows, mids, and high frequencies, all kind of at the same level. And now the cool thing is, if we convolve the two things, we actually get a sound that is the overlap of the two. Which is now the dark shaded area. Which as you can tell, is more or less exactly the original sound, right? So this is the cymbal sound convolved with the white noise. But since convolution is essentially the multiplication of these two things, which now is represented as the dark area, this is almost the original sound. All right. So maybe we can hear it again real quick, the convolution? Tatsuya Takahashi Can we hear the noise? The noise without the convolution. Christoph Hohnerlein All right. OK. So now, you can play back your old sound. We already did this, kind of boring. Let’s maybe go to the most basic sound you can imagine, and that is a single frequency, essentially an oscillator. So this sounds like this. [speaker picks up another graph] There’s a little more here. All right. So this is just a single sinusoid playing, which can be a low bass note, right? This can be a mid, which over here, can go very high. And the same thing is true as before, that convolution is the multiplication of the two spectra. And now, you can see something cool. As we move this around, different parts of the two spectra overlap and different parts are now shaded in dark. Right? So if we can hear the results of convolution? [Max goes up and down the frequency spectrum using the Granular Convolver] All right. And you can tell this is more or less what we were describing before. It’s some sort of mix of both signals. But obviously we can go a bit further because also this is kind of a boring input signal. So now, if you use a more interesting, complex spectrum, which in this case represents just a more complex synth note, right? So maybe it sounds like this. [synth plays] It’s a very defined fundamental again, but with like some overtones. Something that would come out of a synthesizer. Now something really cool happens. Now, we have a really complex overlap of the two spectra. You can obviously move it around. All right. And obviously again, depending on where you are, obviously depending on both signals the overlap changes, which produces really interesting new sonic properties. Right. And obviously, you don’t need to use a synthesized sound at all. You can use, for example, voice, very straightforward. Tatsuya Takahashi Mine? Christoph Hohnerlein Can you help me with this? Thank you for being a stand for a couple of minutes. [Tatsuya speaks into mic which is connected to the Granular Convolver] I think since you have the controls, maybe talk a bit about what’s going on. Tatsuya Takahashi [speaker talks inaudibly through Granular Convolver] Because I’m speaking through the ride cymbal... Get different tone of qualities. Christoph Hohnerlein All right. Want to play a bit more with it or... All right. And obviously, you can just go ahead and jam with it. Afterwards? Maximilian Rest Yeah. Tatsuya Takahashi OK. But we haven’t finished rebuilding the thing. [points at screen] Mari hasn’t finished. Maximilian Rest I mean we can jam out a bit. The Convolver is a beast. But if we stay in this cymbal... I mean, we can also check out what else Tats recorded secretly... Christoph Hohnerlein Might be embarrassing. Tatsuya Takahashi I have no idea what samples I have in there. Maximilian Rest But, I mean, you’re not limited at all to impulse-y stuff like the cymbal that we’ve just recorded. So there’s basically, for convolution, I personally find it works best when you think of it like having one thing which is more impulse-y, and one thing which is more textural. This reminds you, maybe a bit, if you’re familiar with convolution reverb, where you record room impulse responses which catch the whole frequency information or resonant information of a room. So here, with the cymbal which is more of an impulse, we’ve transferred a more textural or impulse-y sound with the texture of the cymbal. But what I wanted to say is, it works best if you just use one of each. If you have one textural thing, and one impulse-y thing. Tatsuya Takahashi But that’s what you think. Maximilian Rest Yeah. That’s what I think, of course. Yeah. Tatsuya Takahashi But I’ve seen people in term one, convolving flute with spoken voice, or synths with other synths. Which are combinations of rhythmical things with textural things. I think you can do textural things... Maximilian Rest Yeah, that’s true. You can also go long. [speaker makes droning sounds with Granular Convolver] It’s still there, you can hear the cymbal, the attack-y stuff or the hissy stuff of the cymbal cutting through there. Christoph Hohnerlein [sound changes drastically] Different sound. Maximilian Rest That’s a good one. Tatsuya Takahashi I think that’s a flexitone, if anyone knows what that is. Max, can we hear the dry sound, and also the sample. I can’t recognize what the sample is. OK. That’s the dry sound? Maximilian Rest That’s the dry sound, yeah. Tatsuya Takahashi And... I still don’t recognize what this is. What is it? Oh, I remember now. This was a sample I used for a gig actually, and they had loads of drinks on a trolley and they were dragging it across the floor, which I thought was a wonderful sound. Maximilian Rest Yep, I mean, you’ve played a gig already with it in Moscow, I think, right? Tatsuya Takahashi Yeah. Maximilian Rest So how was the experience? Tatsuya Takahashi It was really good because I was just going around looking for interesting sounds. And I guess the point of this instrument is that, yes, it’s a fun and it’s an interesting way of working with sound, it’s a new way of working with sound, but ultimately, it’s about listening more and it’s about paying attention to sounds more, and I think that’s a real driver for this... Driving creativity, and inspiring people to make different music. And I think, so far, it’s been pretty positive. Term one’s been going very well, everyone’s been very engaged and I’ve seen at least three acts who have incorporated the Convolver into their live sets and we’ll see what happens in term two. Maybe there’s footage of that that’s due to come out. I think that wraps up our talk. Maximilian Rest Yeah. Tatsuya Takahashi OK. And there we go. [speaker points to screen] Bravo, Mari. Maximilian Rest Yeah, I think we should open for questions and just open the conversation with you guys. Christoph Hohnerlein There should be a mic somewhere. Tatsuya Takahashi Any questions. No? That was very easy. Cool. We leave... Oh... Audience Member It is a super cool idea to fuse two different sounds, and you made it sound as if It’s a new thing. When you said that you can combine two different synthesizers, for example, I imagined that to turn out really funky stuff. And so my question is, has this not been done before? Or has it just not been done before to put such technology into such a small device? Maximilian Rest Second. Tatsuya Takahashi I think the latter. It’s been done. Convolution itself, it’s like hundreds of years old, or something like that. Maximilian Rest It’s super old. Yeah. Tatsuya Takahashi But it’s a very expensive, as in computationally expensive, process, so it’s only recently that it’s been... Or in the last few decades, that it’s been possible to actually use in processing sounds, and even more recent that we can actually put this in a handheld hardware device. So I think, to my knowledge, this is the first time that this kind of convolution, or granular convolution, has been put into a dedicated piece of hardware. Maximilian Rest I mean it’s... Sorry. Christoph Hohnerlein I think the only place where, as a creative music production context you would, at least as a user, come into contact with convolution is reverbs, reverb plugins... Maximilian Rest Guitar simulation, probably. Amp simulation. Christoph Hohnerlein Right, but I don’t think you actually know that it’s convolution inside. Maximilian Rest Sure, yeah. Christoph Hohnerlein The only time you read “convolution” is maybe in a reverb context, and it’s been used in other plugins already, since now you usually have plenty of power in all the machines. But I don’t think it’s been, outside of maybe more sound design, very much a focus of the creative process. Audience Member Tats. May I call you Tats? Tatsuya Takahashi Of course. Audience Member Cool. You said that you use it in one of your gigs? Tatsuya Takahashi Yes. Audience Member What kind of sounds did you use? because you spoke about the difference between more impulse-y and more textural stuff, and I’d like to hear how you use it in your set. Tatsuya Takahashi I played an ambient set, but it was a combination of some percussive sounds and some synthesizers. It was a very simple set up. I had two synthesizers. Actually, I had the [Korg] Volca FM going into the [Korg] Monotribe which is an analog synth, and it has analog drums on it. And the Monotribe was filtering the FM output. So I essentially had like one output that was going into the Convolver, which was a mix of percussive hats with kind of pad-y chord stuff that was being chopped up with the Monotribe filter, which is one of my favorite combinations, by the way. So that was being smeared out using this device, and being convolved with that trolley sound that we just heard, and it just made some really beautiful textures, and I was just changing the grain size, just slowly going through the sample, picking out various small nuances in the grain, and just moving through that for a whole hour. And I thought it was great. Maximilian Rest Yeah. Audience Member Curious to hear. Tatsuya Takahashi I hope others did too. Audience Member Thanks. Tatsuya Takahashi Thank you. Audience Member It’s a two-part question. So you said, basically, convolution is multiplying, right? You multiply it, just two waves. Maximilian Rest Of the spectrum. In the frequency domain of the sound, I mean. Audience Member Oh, OK. Maximilian Rest What we’ve just shown on this screen, that shows all the... Audience Member Yeah, yeah. So my question is, if you have a Eurorack module that is a multiplier, is that essentially convolution? Maximilian Rest No, then you can multiply the time domain. The wave itself, if you just imagine this being a sine wave... [Max draws a sine wave in the air with his hand] Audience Member Oh, I see. Maximilian Rest ... Would represent as just a line in the spectrum, because the spectrogram shows you all frequencies and their magnitude. And if you have a sine wave, in the time domain it will look like this, and just go on forever. In the spectrum it will just be one line. What you want to do is multiply the frequencies that are in both sounds, not the time domain signal, which is the waveform, and then transfer... Audience Member Because then it would just be a ring modulator, right? Maximilian Rest Exactly. Audience Member And the third part, I guess. So if you have something that does this multiplication, and you connect a granular synthesizer into that, then essentially you’ve got the Convolver, right? Maximilian Rest Right, it’s still multiplying time domain signals. Audience Member OK. No, but I’m saying if you something that does the multiplication of the spectrum... Tatsuya Takahashi Not the multiplication, but the convolution you mean... Audience Member The convolution, yeah. Tatsuya Takahashi If you had a convolution device, and you had some kind of granular thing before it. Maximilian Rest I mean, you just even need a granular sampler maybe. What the granular convolver does, it just takes what we call the grain from a bigger recording, and it analyzes the frequency content of this grain, and then uses this as the fingerprint to imply on the live input. If you change the controls, you slice out a different grain, and we just do calculations in parallel to analyze this one and then crossfade between these different grains. So if you had something which does convolution, it will always need something to analyze. And this would be the same, actually. Audience Member And do you have any plans of doing this in Eurorack format or... Tatsuya Takahashi We don’t even have plans to sell this thing. Audience Member OK. It’s just... OK. Tatsuya Takahashi Yeah, so we don’t know. Like I said, it’s a very raw and a very minimal implementation of granular convolution. And I think we’re still learning and we’re still trying to figure out, firstly, whether it would make a good commercial product, and what the possibilities are. I think those are very open things that we’re just kind of trying to absorb right now. Maximilian Rest I mean, you can see already on the form factor, after the rounds of discussion you can also hold it if you want. The nice thing about the collaborations with Tats and the academy is, I think, also, besides it’s a lot of fun, that we can also make material studies or product design studies. This is super far from being a commercial product in every sense, from manufacturing and... It doesn’t make sense to make it like this, but it’s nice like this. It feels good, and... Audience Member I’ve seen people are using stuff that looks a lot worse. Maximilian Rest Yeah. And the same thing with this guy, [speaker picks up Granular Convolver prototype] we actually explored aluminum in this one, and we explored stainless steel in that one. So, to answer your question from another perspective, we would also have to completely re-engineer it in every sense, if there would have to be an idea of making it available. Audience Member Thanks. Tatsuya Takahashi Be nice. Maximilian Rest Say again? Tatsuya Takahashi Be nice. Audience Member Well, thanks for the great talk. The visual aids were amazing and I may borrow them for teaching them in the future. My question is actually quite simple. It’s about the choice of technology for the unit. You’re using Raspberry Pi. Just maybe to support the first question, I guess convolution, from experience, is a very simple concept, but it’s hard to implement, right? It’s very CPU hungry, and this is why this is such a unique product in my opinion. Well, it’s not really a product, but a unique device. My question is, how much are you pushing the limits of this Raspberry Pi? You mentioned hacking. How much space did you leave for anyone who’s lucky enough to have one? How much can they do, still, on top of what’s already running? Tatsuya Takahashi Well, we’re only using two of the four cores, actually, aren’t we? But that was more a trade-off of battery life, because it had to be a portable device, so it was finding the balance of what would make sense. If you wanted to really push the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, then yes, you would get more. But that wasn’t really the point. You would probably get a longer grain size. You would be able to work with longer grains. ’Cause currently the setting is from seven milliseconds to 700. But that is enough. If you wanna zoom into a certain fragment of the sound and use that, then you actually don’t need long convolution. So it kind of depends on what you want to do. In terms of performance, yeah, we can push it a bit more. Audience Member Maybe bit more detail? Christoph Hohnerlein In general, CPU load-wise, on average, we’re below 50. Maximilian Rest Yeah, I think in the 20s. Christoph Hohnerlein Maybe 30. I mean, whatever the precise number is. It’s more that since there’s certain times that we have to do a lot in this case, just time-wise, there’s performance spikes where obviously you can’t hit 100% otherwise you’ll have drop-outs and it will sound absolutely terrible. In a screen, you can have a drop-out, if you miss a frame, it’s not that bad, but in sound if you have just a tiny slice of silence it will sound terrible. So it absolutely cannot drop a single frame, obviously, and that might be the problem that you had before actually, having the average CPU load very high. Audience Member I was just asking in terms of just curiosity how much hacking space there is. Maximilian Rest Yeah, but there is the space. Audience Member That’s great. Maximilian Rest And if not, just remove the Convolver script and put something else there. [laughs] Then you have the full CPU power. Audience Member All right. Thanks guys. Tatsuya Takahashi Are we good? OK, let’s wrap it up. Thank you very much for your attention. Maximilian Rest Yeah, thanks. Christoph Hohnerlein Thank you. [applause]

Gudrun Gut
A musician, performance artist, DJ, radio host, club organizer, label owner and more, Gudrun Gut is also a feminist icon who has been at the forefront of forward-thinking music in Berlin for decades. After moving to the city in the ’70s to study visual communication at Hochschule der Künste, she co-founded Einstürzende Neubauten, a pioneering band of the German avant-garde and industrial scene. While Gut left shortly after Einstürzende Neubauten’s initial gigs, she went on to play in several more influential bands, including Mania D, a new wave group who imbued their music with elements of free jazz, all-female post-punk band Malaria! and the more synth-led Matador. In the ’90s, Gut founded two record labels, Moabit Music and Monika Enterprise, both of which exclusively release the work of female artists. After decades of collaborative work, Gut surprised listeners with her acclaimed 2007 debut, I Put a Record On, on which she made surprising forays into downtempo electronic music. Today, in addition to running her record labels and making new music, she is a host on Ocean Club Radio and works as an active member of the international female:pressure network.
In her 2018 Red Bull Music Academy Berlin lecture, Gut reflected on musical life in the city before and after the fall of the Wall, why she prefers collectives over bands and how she feels more free now than ever.
Hosted by Hanna Bächer Welcome the very first lecture of term two of the 2018 Red Bull Music Academy and mostly welcome Gudrun Gut. [applause] Gudrun Gut Hello, thanks for having me. Hanna Bächer We are at Funkhaus, as you all know. And I had to look that up, but it’s four kilometers to what used to be the closest checkpoint between East and West Berlin, which was at Sonnenallee. And it’s another kilometer from there to where the last refugee from Eastern Germany got shot by the border police of the GDR. That was in February 1989. You had lived for 14 years in Berlin by that point. How were you aware of what was going on around the wall? Gudrun Gut Oh yes, I came to Berlin in 1975. I was grown up in North Germany in the “Heatherlands,” where we heard this wonderful tune in the beginning. And naturally we, as West Germans, we knew that West Berlin was occupied, was surrounded by the “Red Sea.” That’s what they called it. Hanna Bächer In the media, or did you among your peers call it the Red Sea? Gudrun Gut In the media. The Red Sea was communism, the DDR. And so to get from West Germany to West Berlin you had to cross the Red Sea. And the autobahn was very bad, and we had to be very nice people at the border and smile and not make jokes because otherwise they won’t let you through, and this kind of stuff. It was pretty serious. Hanna Bächer Can you still remember that very first journey when you came from Lüneburger Heide, which is kind of like northern, very flat lands in West Germany, and then you had to cross East Germany. This very first visit, how did it work? Could you bring records for example? Gudrun Gut I remember it super well, because I came with my then boyfriend who was gay, half gay, and he wanted to show... I was 15 or 16, and he wanted to show me West Berlin where his gay friends were, and he used to work in an antique bookshop, and he wanted to show me his Berlin. I had no idea about it. I didn’t even know. And then we came here... I don’t remember the drive, but I remember getting off at Schlesisches Tor, and suddenly there was this smell, there were these people shouting. It was lively, it was dirty. I simply loved it. Because West Germany was super sterile, and everything was organized, and you know I couldn’t breath anymore there. That’s when I decided to go to Berlin. Hanna Bächer And you applied for art university. Gudrun Gut Yeah, and I studied at the Hochschule der Künste, HdK, now UdK, academy for arts. I studied visual communication. Hanna Bächer Was that some of your early music projects, which we’re obviously gonna get to, have sort of verged in performance art? Was that part of your studies to learn about or do performance art at uni. Gudrun Gut No, no, no. Actually, I wanted to become an experimental film maker. That was my idea. And then I learned, because visual communication was then kind of... I didn’t wanna be a painter, because my understanding of art was a little bit further than painting, and so I wanted to become an experimental film maker, and video and stuff, and I did it as well. But then I learned at the university that it’s really hard to survive with it, that you need to apply for money for it, and that it takes a long, long time. And then came punk music and I thought I better form a band. Because I wanted to have it quick, I wanted to do something. I wanted, I was eager to kind of... Hanna Bächer Impatient. Gudrun Gut Impatient, yeah. Totally. Hanna Bächer I want to play a video, which is video number four, please, and then we talk about what is in there. (video: Mania D – “Herzschlag”)
Gudrun Gut That was a photo session with Bettina Köster on the left, me in the middle, I used to be young, and Karin Luner on the right. But in the band was Beate Bartel as well, later Liaisons Dangereuses. Karin Luner was a fashion designer, and we did this photo session with her on the Teufelsberg in Berlin. Hanna Bächer And what are the instruments we’re hearing? Gudrun Gut Yeah, this is a 7" single we did with Mania D. We mostly did a kind of half-improv, atmospheric, kind of punk mixture concerts and tracks, and this was “Herzschlag,” called “Heartbeat.” I used to play the drums in... [mimics hitting a drum] And there’s another track where I play more drums. Anyway, yeah, I used to play the drums in Mania D and the Korg MS-20. That was kind of the body and head idea, the Korg for my head and the drums for my body. Hanna Bächer Before you did that, I mean looking at your discography, or at anyone’s discography who was around in West Berlin at that time, it feels like there were about 200 people, and everyone was in a band with everyone at one point. Can you still remember, or can you tell us what your very first live experience was? Who was that with, and where? Gudrun Gut My very first band was a band called DinA4 with four girls, but we never did any concerts. We only tried out clothes and did some rehearsals. And then we joined in with a band called Testbild, me and Coca-Cola on drums. I played the Stylophone, which is a little toy keyboard. And we formed DIN A Testbild, and we played the SO36, which still exists. That was the opening of it, I think, and David Bowie was there. Hanna Bächer But SO36, it used to be a Turkish place, right, before it became... Gudrun Gut Yeah, and then on and off they used it for Turkish marriage, and then Martin Kippenberger, for those who are into art might have heard his name, he at one point took over the SO36 later and got Lydia Lunch to play, and James Chance and the Contortions and New York underground stuff. That was later, I think. I’m a little bit confused with time. Hanna Bächer That’s OK. No one’s... Gudrun Gut SO36 was a really important venue for punk times in the ’80s. We played there very often. We organized parties ourselves there, and played with Mania D and Malaria! very often. Hanna Bächer These different worlds that existed in West Berlin at that time, a large Turkish community in Kreuzberg predominantly, and then you guys, the art school maybe, some sort of highly complex politics. How did that clash? Did you feel like you could just do whatever you wanted, in terms of fashion for example? Gudrun Gut Yeah. In a way. Because Berlin, nobody cared about what happened in West Berlin then, because it was kind of... Here in West Berlin only pensioners were living, and students, and people who didn’t wanna go in the army, because Berlin was kind of occupied... Free sector, so you didn’t have to go to the army. And so this was pretty... Young people and old people, there were no businesses, no real business happening. So we could do whatever we wanted, I think. There was a big feminist movement, a big gay community... Hanna Bächer Related to the fact that you could escape your army duties when moving from West Germany to Berlin, you should say. Gudrun Gut Yeah. It’s true. Hanna Bächer Was it difficult to get specific things to West Berlin? Was it difficult to get records across the border, or clothes or whatever? Did that influence your little store that you had? Gudrun Gut The problem was that there were no real fashion shops like you have now. In those days, we were going to England, to London, to go shopping because it was much cheaper than now and they had the young designers who sold their clothes in little shops, and that’s where we went. And then so we thought we need to open a shop where we can sell Berlin designers and get some stuff from the flea market and change it over, and I bought a knitting machine and was knitting stuff, like really nice trousers for men, I was knitting. Hanna Bächer Knitted trousers for men. Gudrun Gut Yes. [laughs] Hanna Bächer You could make a fortune with those now probably. Gudrun Gut They were pretty cool, and pullovers and... Hanna Bächer Do any still exist? Gudrun Gut No. I have some pictures, but not much... They still look good, actually. Hanna Bächer But that was... You finished, no you were still going to art uni, I guess, and you just opened a store because it was so cheap that you could just do that. Gudrun Gut Yeah. Bettina had found the store, and she lived in the back. It was just easy to rent because it had the store in the front and an apartment in the back, and she was living there, and she asked me, “Shall we open a store?” And I said, “Yeah, why not.” And then we called it Eisengrau because we painted it all in iron gray, which is eisengrau. Hanna Bächer And apart from Bettina, who has been a very important collaborator of yours ever since, there was also another person living in the store. Is that right? There was a young gentleman who kind of like half lived in the store? Gudrun Gut You mean Blixa? Hanna Bächer Yes. Gudrun Gut Yeah. After Bettina found a different apartment... She didn’t wanna do the shop anymore, and so Blixa came in. They changed. So I continued the shop with Blixa Bargeld from Einstürzende Neubauten. But we were all friends before and we used to play in a band together and stuff. Hanna Bächer And that’s pre-Einstürzende Neubauten time, right? Gudrun Gut That’s true. Hanna Bächer How did a guy like him, what was he doing, which kind of art pieces? How was he performing art in the city at that time? Gudrun Gut No, he didn’t perform at all. We had Mania D, I think that was the time we had Mania D. And our rehearsal room was in Blixa’s other apartment, before, or was it afterward...? Hanna Bächer So he lived in your store, and you rehearsed in his flat. Gudrun Gut It must have been afterwards. Anyway, we rehearsed in his apartment, the cellar of his apartment, and he wanted to have a band as well, and me and Beate joined Neubauten for the first year. There was Andrew, Blixa, Beate, me and I think Suse. So it was kind of a 50/50 band, 50% female. And then afterwards I went on with Mania D, and Blixa... We split. Hanna Bächer You stayed friends, though? Gudrun Gut Yeah, we stayed. We were friends before, and we were sharing our love for music. We have similar musical taste. We both love Neu! Hanna Bächer The band Neu!? Gudrun Gut Yeah, the band Neu! Hanna Bächer Because the music that you were making with Mania D and then Malaria! kind of resembles Einstürzende Neubauten in a way that... It sounds new. It’s not that much related to music with traditional instruments. I know that you’re doing it with this idea of not actually learning an instrument and just doing stuff, but at the same time you had a sound engineer on stage which I think in electronic music is sort of the equivalent of a classically trained musician in a band with instrumentalists. You did have a super pro in your band, right? Which is... Gudrun Gut Beate Bartel. Hanna Bächer Which is Beate. Gudrun Gut Yeah, Beate was a sound technician, and she was part of Mania D. So yeah, you can call it that. But the idea... There was this movement in Berlin called Geniale Dilletanten, the Genius Dilettantes, that was a scene in the beginning of the ’80s. All the bands, Neubauten, Mania D, Malaria!, Die Tödliche Doris, Sprung Aus Den Wolken, there were lots of bands in Berlin, in different collaborations, and there was this big festival called Genius Dilettantes where we could associate with, because it was similar in New York as well, that you didn’t wanna be this super genius instrumentalist. It was much more about creativity than to be a good... Comparing it with art, we didn’t wanna be a good painter. We wanted to do art. But we wanted to do music in reference to the art scene a little bit. And the idea was... It was a revolt against the music which was played on the radio, which was over produced LA stuff, Toto and this. We didn’t like this at all. We wanted to have something simple, but street orientated, and it was very fashionable to change instruments after each song. That at the beginning of the ’80s was the thing to do. But because we didn’t wanna do a guitar solo, it was totally forbidden to do a guitar solo. There were rules how music should be. The drums shouldn’t... No solos at all. Simple stuff. Something to surprise the others, do something you’ve never done before... All these little strange rules. Hanna Bächer That’s sort of similar to the approach that Kippenberger had in art, right? Also, he was an extremely good painter but purposefully made paintings that didn’t necessarily show that. Were there a lot of conversations between the scene around him and the music scene in Berlin where you exchanged concepts across music and art? Gudrun Gut We didn’t discuss so many things, we were doing things. So we hang out with Kippenberger, and we played at his office. He called it the Büro, Kippenberger Büro at Segitzdamm in Kreuzberg, and I played with a different collaboration called Summe über Zukunft, later Liebesgier. You don’t have to remember those names. Because we came out of the ’68 generation who discussed everything, we didn’t wanna discuss things anymore, we wanted to do things. Because everything was discussed for hours and hours in the generation which we were fighting against. So we just wanted to do things. Hanna Bächer Can we watch video number ten, please? This is Malaria! live with “Kaltes Klares Wasser.” (video: Malaria! – “Kaltes Klares Wasser” (live))
Gudrun Gut We didn’t do so many instrument changes. But people did it. We didn’t do it. But we didn’t wanna... I played drums because I didn’t like anybody else... I didn’t like any other people... I wanted to play... Hanna Bächer You didn’t want anyone else to play drums? Gudrun Gut Yeah, I wanted to play drums because I had an idea how I would do it. And we had some other drummers, and I didn’t like how they played. And I said, “I do the drums.” And I did it really simple, but I have a good rhythmic feel. And it helped... I played accordion before, and there you have to, you know, do different things... Coordination. Hanna Bächer You learned that when you were a child or a young person, you learned accordion? Gudrun Gut Yeah. I just wanted to give a name check here. This is Malaria!, and for Malaria! Beate was not in the band anymore. She had Liaisons Dangereuses who had a big success with “Los Niños Del Parque,” and so Malaria! formed after Mania D with Bettina Köster singing, me playing drums, Christine Hahn who used to play with Glenn Branca from New York, and Susanne Kuhnke, and Manon P. Duursma playing guitar. So we had two drums and syntheziser. Hanna Bächer Still in regards to my sound engineering and syncing question, because you were playing machines that you couldn’t easily... Gudrun Gut We didn’t sync it. Hanna Bächer ... It’s not like playing Ableton Live basically. Gudrun Gut No, no. I mean we had two drums, and Susanne played keyboards more, and then it was more a band. We didn’t have so much syncing stuff. She played the synthesizer live. And when I played the Korg I had little notes, it was really hard to remember... It was always a bit different, because the Korg is always different. Hanna Bächer So the whole setup, despite the punk idea, the whole setting up your instruments on stage took you quite a while until you got anywhere. So you did have to prepare each show to make it work. Or how spontaneous were you in that music making with an instrument like the Korg MS-20? Gudrun Gut Not much. But it was, I played the Korg at the very beginning of Mania D... Hanna Bächer And then you gave it up. Gudrun Gut And then with Neubauten. In those days we had more improv sessions. So longer tracks where we had time to kind of adjust it. And with Malaria! I played drums and guitar and backing vocals, so it was more a real live band. Hanna Bächer Did you consider yourself, because there’s surprisingly few recordings, especially of Mania D. You know, you would think there should be a lot more, and I wonder at that time, did you even consider yourself a band that needs recordings to be out there, or was it really just about hanging out and playing together, because that’s the best thing you can do on a Monday night, Thursday night or whatever? Gudrun Gut Yeah. We wanted to entertain ourselves. It was super boring, and we wanted to do something, and we wanted to do something which is more interesting than what anyone else is doing, so we just did what we wanted to do. The big difference I think... It was a very small scene then, and there was no music business as such in Germany, because music business was in UK and America, and we didn’t have any. There was nothing. So it was fun. It was more for fun and art, that’s why the art thing came in so naturally because we didn’t have a biz, a pop biz. Hanna Bächer With there being a music industry now, and it being big and influential, or partly not big and very underground, do you think nowadays you would still, if you were however old you were then, 20, now, would you still make music although there is that industry? Or do you think you would probably not do it because you could actually get released nowadays? Gudrun Gut I have no idea. Because I’m too old to imagine to be young. But I think if I would start now I would do gardening. [laughter] Hanna Bächer Like radical gardening. Extreme gardening. Gudrun Gut Yeah. Or art. Because the music business is... Because I come from a not very wealthy background, and I think a lot of people now who start doing experimental, like arty music, they do have really rich parents. Because you know, it’s not a thing where you can make a living of. It’s really hard, and people know it’s hard to make a living out of music. Hanna Bächer So you need another source of income, ideally? Gudrun Gut Yeah. Hanna Bächer Also, I mean with Malaria! you did have some success. At least you were able to leave the country, you were able to leave the island of West Berlin. Gudrun Gut We left the country the first year of existence. Hanna Bächer And you went to New York. Gudrun Gut New York. Straight to New York. [sings] If you can make it there... Hanna Bächer But the New York you encountered then was also a very different New York than there is now. So the places you played in New York... Gudrun Gut Yeah, it was very close to Berlin feel. It was very underground. Somebody invited us to play there, and then we went. And then we played Washington, Philadelphia, came back and forth, then we met some friends, and then we could play Danceteria, Peppermint Lounge, and Mudd Club later... Hanna Bächer You’re saying that as if you’re, [mimics looking upset] “Uh, played Danceteria...” Gudrun Gut It just happened. Hanna Bächer But those were, I mean, at least speaking about it nowadays, those were like... Gudrun Gut We played Studio 54. Hanna Bächer Yeah, you did. It’s not a random place. Really. What kind of night was that? Gudrun Gut Accident. It’s pure accident. Hanna Bächer What kind of night was that that you played Studio 54 with Malaria!? Gudrun Gut Studio 54? That was Yom Kippur, great idea, and Nina Hagen played there, and she didn’t have a band, and we were friends with Nina Hagen, some might know, Berlin superstar, punk, great person, and she asked us to be the backing band. Then she had only a bass player, and she did three songs with him and three with us, and then we played as well. And then she wanted to play drums with us. [laughs] It was kind of fun, it was pretty fun. Hanna Bächer She’s like, “You’re better than I am, so I can be your backing band.” Can we please watch video number six? (video: Malaria! – “Your Turn To Run”)
Gudrun Gut Your turn to run? Hanna Bächer Or you turn to run. Gudrun Gut Your turn to run. Yeah. The track was recorded in New York, but the video footage is a bit unscharf, blurry. But it’s Super 8 leftover material from Berlin, ’80s, Kreuzberg after the first of May demonstration, where the cars were... The car where we were in, there were like... Hanna Bächer The burnt car. Someone actually burned that the day before. Gudrun Gut Genau [exactly]. There were a couple of them standing in Dresdener Straße. Hanna Bächer Was that a time... I mean, I guess most people in that scene, like Mark Reeder for example, were involved in also the political side of the struggle of living in West Berlin, which is mostly meant, to be a squatter. Was that your fight? Was it your fight to try to squat houses and rebel against big capitalism? Gudrun Gut We were supporting that, actually. We did go on the street for it, but we were not 100% on the street only. We were kind of more... How do you say that? We were political but not too much? Hanna Bächer More in a private sphere. Was it a political stand to mostly play with women? Or was it because it was more fun? Gudrun Gut It was just a natural thing. Hanna Bächer Yeah. Gudrun Gut Much more like that. Hanna Bächer It’s not like... There was no manifesto, or you wouldn’t have stood on a stage and said, “I mostly play with women.” Gudrun Gut No. Hanna Bächer I know that in basically every interview in that time some music journalism dude is asking you, “Hey, you’re only playing with women.” And you’re like... [shrugs] Gudrun Gut No, but we didn’t like that. We wanted to more have it as if it would be normal, so this was our attitude. I became a feminist in 2000. Hanna Bächer Do you remember the day? [laughs] What happened? Gudrun Gut Somewhere in 2000, because I had an interview with Missy Magazine, and she asked me if I’m a feminist. And I really had to think about it because I never considered myself... I always acted as if everything is normal. I came out like in the end of the ’70s, I was kind of an emancipated woman, girl, but then I just ignored it and did what I did. And then I realized that all the girls are not there anymore, just me basically. The music scene was very male, and then I called myself a feminist, suddenly Hanna Bächer In 2000? What happened to everyone? I mean Malaria! was, I think, playing, the first time you existed, you existed until about ’84, and then these years until ’89, what happened to the scene? What happened to the girls you were playing with? What happened to everyone? Gudrun Gut Beate came back to Berlin. She used to be in Düsseldorf. Bettina stayed in New York, Christine stayed in New York. Beate came back to Berlin, and me, Beate, and... Or Beate, Manon, and me... Hanna Bächer You did Matador. Gudrun Gut We formed Matador. And then we got an Atari computer and started programming and got into this kind of more electronic field. Hanna Bächer The clubs that were around sort of in the second half of the ’80s, I mean SO36 still exists for example, as you just said, but did they change? I mean leading up, no one saw the wall coming down, right? No one anticipated that to happen. But how did the vibe change? Now thinking back to the second half of the ’80s, did it feel different here, or rather, five kilometers from here? Gudrun Gut The beginning of the ’80s was very enthusiastic, lots of stuff happening, like new bands, everybody was doing something. And then suddenly it got really dark, lots of drugs, and it really kind of imploded, and there was no support from the scene anymore. It was really getting a bit funny. I think it’s really nice in the B-movie as well, you can really see it. It was not good anymore. I decided I wanted to leave the city at that stage, but then the wall came down. And then suddenly Berlin was really exciting again. I mean, new, double the size, new clubs, new nightlife... Hanna Bächer New people. Gudrun Gut New people, yeah. Warmth, human warmth coming from the East. I had a lot of new friends from East Germany, East Berlin. It was really cool. Hanna Bächer OK, so I have to ask this since I’m a) too young and b) grew up in West Germany and don’t have a clue really. But this, let’s say one of the very first nights that you went out after the wall came down, you’re standing in a bar that you always go to in West Berlin, and suddenly you have new people around you, you’re like, “You’re a punk, too?” Or was that post-punk, kind of? In that music scene, did you quickly meet across this fallen border? Did you reach out to musicians from the GDR? Gudrun Gut We met a couple, Ornament und Verbrechen, and then the Lippok and the Jestram family, this circle. Hanna Bächer Robert Lippok. Gudrun Gut Robert and Ronald Lippok, Tarwater. But that was a bit later, I think. At the beginning it was just going to clubs, and discovering the streets, and it was really dark in East Berlin. There was no lights, and so you had to kind of, “Where are we?” And then the club’s where you had to dig through holes and suddenly there was a club, and it was really cool. I really enjoyed it. And shopping was really difficult because everybody was queuing up for supermarkets, and you couldn’t get anything anymore. Hanna Bächer But, like... it was hard to get stuff at the supermarket but it was easy to get spaces, suddenly. Gudrun Gut Yeah. There were lots of empty spaces. And then in the ’90s everybody, you know the whole scene changed. Because East Berlin was suddenly so exciting. And you got cheap apartments. Everybody moved to East Berlin. Even from West Berlin. Mostly Prenzlauer Berg. And it was like the life in West Berlin died out a little, the underground, there was not much stuff going on. Kreuzberg got really cheap, the apartments at one point, because everybody moved to Prenzlauer Berg and around there. And then suddenly, when it was official that Kreuzberg... The rents were half price, it got really popular again. Then Berlin got... A big city like New York where you just, the areas, you know, Prenzlauer Berg now super expensive. Mitte was cheap at the beginning, super expensive, Kreuzberg, expensive. Neukölln, Kreuzkölln, Neukölln, now let’s see what’s coming up. All the artists and young people who move to Berlin always have to find a new “Bezirk.” Hanna Bächer A new area, yeah. But at this time, in the beginning of the ’90s you actually came here, to Funkhaus. Gudrun Gut That’s right. So, I know this place when it used to be a radio station. Hanna Bächer Please tell that, I want to know the whole story. So someone told you we’re gonna go to this radio station in the GDR. What did you expect? Gudrun Gut No, I was... Actually I played at the 20 years Neubauten and I think it was, or ten. Hanna Bächer More like ten. I think ten. Fifteen. Gudrun Gut Ten years Neubauten concert at the Neue Welt, and I played, on my sampler, I played an old track we played together live. And Heiner Muller was there... Hanna Bächer Who is Heiner Müller? Gudrun Gut The writer, and he saw me, and they were just producing the “Hamletmachine” at the Funkhaus here, and he wanted me to be Ophelia. So then the producer, Mr Rindfleisch and Blixa picked me up in West Berlin, and we drove here and actually recorded the vocals here, and Neubauten did the music for the radio play here. And so this used to be a radio station. Hanna Bächer But the people working here at that time with you were mostly employees from back in the day, so it was fully functioning as a GDR radio station. How did they react to you doing your Neubauten? Or that was a Heiner Müller thing, but still... Gudrun Gut They were really open, very nice. And later I did more music for radio plays with Rindfleisch here in this studio. And it was really cool. They had a lot of female tone engineers. Hanna Bächer Sound engineers. Gudrun Gut Sound engineers. That was a surprise for me because I’ve seen West German radio stations mostly are male. Hanna Bächer But that’s like in any engineering job, in any engineering profession there were more females in East Germany than in the West. Gudrun Gut A lot. But for me it was, “Wow.” You know, to work with three female sound engineers. It was great. Hanna Bächer You said earlier that Berlin was great to go to as a woman, at end of the ’70s. It was great to go if you were queer. Berlin then opening up to East Germany, did it even... Or becoming actually a part of Eastern Germany after the wall came down, did it make it an even better place to be a woman in because of that? Because there were more female professionals in East Germany than in the West? Gudrun Gut No. [laughs] Hanna Bächer Making radio plays, as you said, and working with Heiner Müller, etc, that allowed you to access other funds. It allowed you to get paid maybe in another way than as an independent musician, right? How did you manage to financially survive in all of these years? I mean, we listen to this amazing music, we see all these amazing gigs. But it’s kind of obvious that you can’t be Malaria! onstage four times a month and then pay your rent off that. Gudrun Gut Well, Malaria! was finished in ’84, already. And then I did some spoken word project in Canada with Myra Davis who had a stipendium [scholarship] at the... There was a thing called The Instability of the Feminist Subject in Banff Center for the Arts. And I did radio plays, music for radio plays. Just found some more solo work for myself. And then I bought myself my first Macintosh. So I was able to produce at home, which... That was very... Hanna Bächer About when was that? ’90s? Gudrun Gut ’90s I think, when it was not that expensive anymore. Because it used to be very expensive. Hanna Bächer Would you say in looking back, were you struggling? Gudrun Gut Oh, yeah. Hanna Bächer Were you sometimes... Gudrun Gut I’ve always had big money problems. And doubts, you know, what am I doing? I think I was getting 30 then, and when you get 30 you think now you have to be “erwachsen.” Hanna Bächer An adult, yeah. Gudrun Gut An adult. And you have to find the place in your life. And so that was a big pressure on me. But I came out of a female household, and my mother always was working, so I never had the idea that I married somebody who will feed me. I always had the... I knew I had to do it. I had to make the money for my living. And, yeah, I just didn’t worry so much. I just tried not to worry too much, and took the opportunities I got, and made the best out of it. And then strangely, if you’re not afraid of things, they come. You know, suddenly jobs were coming, and then I was active all the time. You can’t just sit at home and wait for jobs to come. I was doing stuff, so you meet people, and then I got this offer or... Then we did albums with Mania D. And, yeah, worked in studio service, soldered cables, did some other jobs to make some living. I was never a good bar girl. Hanna Bächer Why not? Gudrun Gut I don’t know, it’s not my thing. But a lot of musicians do this. Hanna Bächer Yeah, well it’s also in the evening, it’s maybe convenient for you. Gudrun Gut I DJed. Manon was working at the bar and I DJed. Hanna Bächer Where did you first start DJing? Because that’s kind in the ’90s. Gudrun Gut In the ’80s already. Hanna Bächer In the ’80s. Gudrun Gut Because I wasn’t a good bar girl. So I DJed and Manon, my best friend, she worked at the bar. Hanna Bächer But your first proper... Gudrun Gut And it was better pay too. Hanna Bächer The bar or the DJ? Gudrun Gut No, the DJ. Hanna Bächer Oh, that’s... I’m not sure that’s still the case in Berlin bars nowadays. It’s more like you pay to DJ, you get paid to do the bar. Gudrun Gut But in those days... And then I still sometimes DJ. Hanna Bächer But your first DJ residency was with the Ocean Club. Gudrun Gut Yeah. Hanna Bächer In the basement of the very first Tresor? Was it the first Tresor or was it... Gudrun Gut Tresor, Leipziger Straße. I think so. I had an album that I did, a solo album with lots of friends called, Members Of The Ocean Club. And for the record release party we thought, OK, it’s called, Members of the Ocean Club because I didn’t want to have a band anymore, I wanted to have more like a free-form club thing. And then the idea was, OK, record release, we should do a club in a club. And then Danielle de Picciotto did decoration down in the Tresor in Berlin. And we had a record release party there. And it was so cool that we continued, every week we had the Ocean Club with kind of strange music. Hanna Bächer These clubs like Tresor, which I think opened in ’92 or so, and other places that were later mostly playing techno in Berlin, were those spaces where you immediately felt like you’re at the right place, or was that confusing and different to you, coming from already being active in the ’80s. Is that something that you were part of from the beginning? Or did you feel like, “What are people doing here?” They’re staying awake for three days. I mean, you probably did that too in ’81. Gudrun Gut Yeah, [laughs] that’s nothing new. Hanna Bächer But the attitude, was it... Gudrun Gut No, it was really strange because nobody knew me, and knew us anymore. Nobody was talking about the ’80s in the ’90s. And that was kind of... Hanna Bächer Was it a relief? Gudrun Gut Freeing. It was nice. And I had the feeling, when I saw Jeff Mills playing at the Tresor, it really reminded me... It was different, but it reminded me of this pureness and straightness from the very beginning of the ’80s. And so I liked it. A lot of my other colleagues from the ’80s didn’t like techno at all. Hanna Bächer Why not, what did they dislike? Gudrun Gut I don’t know, they were really... They thought it was not right. I don’t know. It reminded me very much of... It was very underground, it was great, and pure and true. Hanna Bächer One thing... Gudrun Gut It changed a lot. Hanna Bächer One thing that I think it might still be the case in Berlin but it isn’t in many other cities, is that there are now no cameras in many of the clubs. And there were certainly no cameras in Tresor for the first half of the ’90s. And that did allow for a certain... It did allow for nudity, It did allow for people to be naked on the dancefloor if they wanted to. Gudrun Gut I have never seen that. Hanna Bächer You have never seen that. It’s not actually a thing. It’s just myths that people tell. Gudrun Gut I wasn’t there every night, but I didn’t... Hanna Bächer I’m asking it in regards to... Gudrun Gut We had dirndls. [laughs] Hanna Bächer Yeah. Gudrun Gut Wearing dirndls. Hanna Bächer That’s quite the opposite. Or it’s not, depending on what you like. But I’m asking also in regards to... Because tracks like “Kaltes Klares Wasser,” which we heard earlier, I find are quite erotic in regards to the lyrics. You might want to Google that, or internet search it, translate the lyrics for yourself, it’s sort of about cold water on certain body parts, etc. You reflecting on being rather attractive young women at that time, were you making a conscious choice to put that out there? Did it happen ironically? Was it just the thing that you were just doing? Were you thinking, “We’re going to do this and it does play with people’s sexual fantasy?” Gudrun Gut For me music has, pop music kind of has to be sexy, in a way, as well. It doesn’t have to be, but it is a part of it, the body part, you know? So I have no restrictions. I can’t say it in English. Hanna Bächer Tell me in German. Gudrun Gut [_talks to Hanna in German: man kann nicht nicht einfach negieren, dass es Sex gibt, and that it’s part of…] Hanna Bächer OK, I’m gonna translate. You can’t deny that sex exists, and that it’s part of who you are, and... Gudrun Gut Of pop culture. Hanna Bächer Pop culture. Gudrun Gut Yeah. Hanna Bächer I want to show a video that you made much, much later, which is video number one, please. Gudrun Gut with “Garten.” (video: Gudrun Gut – “Garten”)
Hanna Bächer Garden. Was that filmed in your garden? Gudrun Gut Yeah. In Uckermark Hanna Bächer And yeah, you made that video. Or you scripted it. Gudrun Gut I scripted it, I didn’t make it. Hanna Bächer The idea is yours, too? To show a naked person? Gudrun Gut The idea was to have... I didn’t want to do like a playback thing. So, my idea was to have a different sex symbol which has nothing to do with the garden. Because garden is associated with something not sexy. But like a naked, good build male figure, I thought was a perfect garden. [laughter] Hanna Bächer I like that. Just keep it at that. Perfect garden. In Ocean Club in the ’90s, you also had... People dressed up, and you created a space. I mean it wasn’t a garden, it was more like a subterranean garden, I guess. Gudrun Gut We had a mermaid working behind the bar. Hanna Bächer It was weekly right? Gudrun Gut Every Sunday night. Upstairs was Ellen Allien and Tanith, and we were downstairs. Hanna Bächer What did each of the rooms represent sort of musically? What did Ellen Allien and Tanith play and what did you play? Gudrun Gut We couldn’t hear each other, because... Hanna Bächer But you know, you still went upstairs, probably, sometimes. Gudrun Gut Yeah, yeah. They were more techno, and we were more experimental, all over the place. Hanna Bächer And that led to... I guess some of you might know led to a radio show on Berlin airwaves... Gudrun Gut Radio Eins. So, at the same time I think... No, when I started the label. So, in 1997, after the club nights I was, “Every Sunday was too much.” I wanted to, “Ah, Thomas, I think we should do a radio show.” Thomas Fehlmann, partner in the club. And then he said, “Great, but how?” And then he got a call from Radio One, which started in 1997. And they asked him to do a radio show. And then we said, OK, let’s do Ocean Club. Gudrun Gut And then we started the Ocean Club radio show every week, which was really a very nice show where we introduced electronic and international experimental electronic and club music. And we had DJ sets, and we had a mermaid, and we had some spoken word artists, it was pretty cool. Hanna Bächer Ocean Club, you already said earlier, it was more of a collective and less of a band. And that has been an idea... When I look at Mania D and Malaria!, etc, to me it feels like a big collective because everyone played with everyone. But you’re doing also the thing now with Monika Werkstatt. Why is that? Why do you prefer working in collectives than in bands? What does that allow that the band doesn’t allow for? Gudrun Gut Because a band is always “eingeengt...” The people who are in the band, and always have to be in the band, and you can’t change it, and I think a club or a collective, it has... People change. And some want to go, and some want to come in. And it’s nice to have a flow happening. I think it’s really nice to collaborate with others, because I think music especially is one of the only art forms who allow that. Because if you’re a painter, it’s difficult to collaborate. But with music, with the tones in the air, suddenly you make a tone and it rubs against the other tone and something new comes out of it. It’s a really nice thing to play music together. So collaborative work I think is really important. I love to collaborate with others. And every time I do it, I learn something new. Because you, you know, I suck into the other person, take what I want. [laughs] And I give what I have to give. [laughter] Hanna Bächer Having done that over so many years, do you feel like you have a defined role that you always take on when you collaborate? Are you creating the space that everyone comes to? Do you prefer to be on the outside in collaborations, is there a Gudrun Gut collaboration... Figure? Do you become someone, repeat certain patterns when collaborating, when communicating with people? Gudrun Gut No. Because, for example when I collaborated with Antye, I do a lot of two-person things, with AGF. Hanna Bächer Antye Greie Fraktion. Gudrun Gut Yeah. We did the Greie Gut Fraktion, and that was very electronic, free approach, but very modern technology kind of thing. After that I collaborated with Hans Joachim Irmler from Faust, totally different thing because he is a kind of Krautrock, keyboard, synthesizer maniac. And really into improv. And I had always these difficulties with improvisation. I was more getting structure into a track, and organize it, and have it proper. And he brought me back into this kind of free-form. And the influence of him I took into the Monika Werkstatt, because suddenly I thought it’s really important to have this improv stuff back into the music. Which I had at the very beginning of my musical career with Mania D and Neubauten. And then along the line I got very much more into more song structure, structuring more, organizing it, cleaning it out. And then now I’m back into the more rough stuff. Hanna Bächer Can we play a snippet of video number two please? Number two. Gut and Bargeld, “Die Sonne.” (video: Gudrun Gut & Blixa Bargeld – “Die Sonne”)
Gudrun Gut That was from the Members Of The Ocean Club album. Hanna Bächer It makes you extremely happy to watch this. Why is that? Gudrun Gut Because it’s so... Hanna Bächer It is very happy, yeah? The drugs were different in the mid-’90s [laughter] than they were in early ’80s, or late ’80s. I mean, that’s actually an honest question. Gudrun Gut [speaks in German]. I don’t have sex and I don’t take drugs. Hanna Bächer I have to put this in a context. That’s an answer that Gudrun gave to an interview question at, I think, E-Werk, which was an influential techno club in the middle of the ’90s, and someone wanted to interview you and wanted to have that sex, drugs and rock & roll answer, and you said that. Gudrun Gut Yeah. Me and Danielle. And they were like, “What?” Hanna Bächer Did they believe you? No. Gudrun Gut [shrugs] But it was true at the time. [laughter] Hanna Bächer Do you want to elaborate? No. Ocean Club, and E-Werk, and all that, that’s mid-’90s. And after you started with two labels, actually, but maybe... Gudrun Gut Yeah, in 1997, the same year as Ocean Club Radio, I started a label called Monika Enterprise. I already had a label called Moabit Music for the re-release of the Malaria! and for Matador. And then I started Monika, where I signed artists from Berlin, and from everywhere. Mostly female artists. Hanna Bächer Mostly female artists because you felt like it’s a necessity to do that? Gudrun Gut No, because of my personal interest. [laughs] Hanna Bächer Yeah. It’s an important point. Let’s please watch video number eight, about a minute and twenty of it. Thank you. (video: Quarks – “Wiederkomm”)
Gudrun Gut. Quarks. Hanna Bächer Quarks, with “Wiederkomm.” Gudrun Gut. Quarks. Jovanka von Wilsdorf and Niels Lorenz. That was the first signing. Hanna Bächer The first release on... Gudrun Gut. It was a 7" on Monika. Hanna Bächer I’m still baffled by it, in a way, because it’s so different than Mania D or Malaria! aesthetics. It’s such a different aesthetic, and the whole context I guess in which that happened, these like, Wohnzimmerkonzerte, feels like how could that have even happened in the same city. Wohnzimmerkonzerte meaning concerts happening in people’s living rooms. So, what kind of Berlin was that, that this kind of existed in, late ’90s? Gudrun Gut That was post techno a little bit. Where Berlin was full of... There were only places for DJs, and no places for music makers. There was this little wohnzimmer scene, and they played in actual living rooms. And the music was, like, the indie alternative scene. Zartcore, you know, quiet is the new loud kind of thing. The major companies were signing this stadium rock, that was a big thing, stadium hip-hop, stadium rock. And this was the opposite. So that was one of the exciting things about it. Hanna Bächer Zartcore translates roughly to gentlecore, I guess. I don’t think that’s a term that’s in use, but obviously say Zartcore because it rhymes with hardcore. But, still, things like Love Parade, etc, continued at the same time, and you continued DJing, and not everything was easy, despite this living room scene. Or was it even that you wanted to create these safe living room spaces because...? Gudrun Gut I just picked it up, I just released it. It existed. Joe Tabu organized a lot of these concerts. And that’s where I saw Barbara Morgenstern playing for the first time. Really impressed me to see this woman playing solo on her organ, her own songs. And I thought, “Wow, she’s really good.” And so, I signed her. And a lot of first signings came out of that. But later I released Cobra Killer, which is much different again. So it’s not necessarily all nice and easy. And this nice feel, and this warmth has... Is reflecting what we all needed then. Because life was difficult, and we want to make it all cozy for ourselves. Hanna Bächer I wonder if we shouldn’t just play a brief Cobra Killer piece. Can we just watch about a minute of video number nine please? (video: Cobra Killer – “Mund Auf, Augen Zu”)
Gudrun Gut No, I wasn’t producing. Hanna Bächer You weren’t producing. I imagined you producing the Monika Werkstatt. So, what is... Gudrun Gut Monika Werkstatt, I organized it. This is an idea, a new idea. The Monika Werkstatt, that’s my recent, kind of the last five years we did this. These are artists out of the Monika/Moabit surrounding, female artists, who are collaborating together on new stuff. We did concerts together, where everybody plays solo and then together. We all three, mostly three or four artists playing together, to introduce the artist plus collaborate. So, it’s a solo show plus a collaboration show, and it’s a great night. And then we were in the studio together producing new material for three days. Ten female producers. And we recorded, and recorded, and recorded. And afterwards everybody took two tracks home and finished the production of the songs, of the material. Edit stuff, everybody did it different. Some, like a remix, some are real songs. Because all of the participating artists were producers as well. So that was kind of handy. Hanna Bächer After first playing the drums, then playing the Korg, or maybe the other way around, and then buying your first Macintosh computer, which are the instruments, or which is the software that you feel most comfortable expressing yourself in nowadays? What is your thing where you’re like, “This is what I need to make music that I couldn’t live without?” Gudrun Gut A cigarette. [laughs] Hanna Bächer A cigarette. A cigarette and a mic. Gudrun Gut And a glass of red wine. I don’t know. I don’t want to be comfortable. Hanna Bächer Yeah. Gudrun Gut For being creative, I don’t want to be comfortable. I want to be creative, but not comfortable. Hanna Bächer Coming from this Geniale Dilletanten, which translates to “Genius Dilettantes,” I think that’s how you say it in English... Coming from that background, did you hit a wall ever, where you felt like, “I need to learn a certain instrument better. I need to learn more about this software to actually do what I want.” Or were you able to stay with that attitude of just, like... Gudrun Gut No, I learned the software. Hanna Bächer What did you learn? Gudrun Gut I mean, every little new synthesizer you get you have to learn it. But I mostly don’t like to read the manual. Hanna Bächer I don’t think anyone does. Gudrun Gut I’m pretty easy, pretty quick with technique. Hanna Bächer What do you use then? What is your favorite software. Gudrun Gut I just got myself a Make Noise 0-Coast synthesizer which is a little complicated. And then I got some Korg, the little toys, the Korg Volca series, four different... That’s what I use a lot. It’s kind of fun and fast. Then Ableton Live I use. I used to have Logic. We started... When I got my Atari we had the... Not Cubase, C-Labs Creator and Notator, which then went into Logic. But, I switched to Ableton Live. That’s what I work with. Hanna Bächer I know that Mark Reeder produced Malaria! at one point, and you went to studios with other people, but at the same time it was kind of more punk back then. Do you feel, making music, do you feel more independent with your set up now? Or do you feel like you were more independent when you could more or less just go up on stage at S036 in 1981 and play the Korg? Are you freer now, with the technology, did that free you? Gudrun Gut Yeah, definitely. Because it was really hard in the old days to have a studio booked. And then you had an engineer you didn’t get on with or something. I have much more control. I have total control because I’m the producer and the engineer. So that means that the result is much closer to what I wanted. Yeah, I think it’s... I’m happy, now. Hanna Bächer And you do release your own music. Gudrun Gut Yeah. And I have my own label. So I don’t have many people to tell me what to do. And so I’m pretty independent. And I have to just question myself, if this is good enough or not, but I have some “Berater” [advisors]. Hanna Bächer Who are your advisors? Gudrun Gut No, just some people I talk to, like business partners as well, who I employ. [laughs] Hanna Bächer Is that funny because you don’t see yourself as an employer or... Gudrun Gut No, because if I employ somebody, he doesn’t really say the truth, does he? [laughter] Hanna Bächer That’s an interesting point though, because I mean you’ve been an influential person in this city for so long. People do respect you, you work a lot with women who are younger than you naturally because they... Gudrun Gut I’m the oldest. Hanna Bächer ... Come into existence. Is it hard sometimes to be in that position where you feel like people, women, respect you but you release their record and you’re like, “I can’t pay you what you think you should get paid,” to pick maybe the most difficult example, is it hard to be, particularly from woman to woman, tell another woman things don’t work the way she thinks? To cut off her dreams? Gudrun Gut It’s reality. No, I think it’s really good to talk about difficult things as well. I’m the person who is not afraid to say anything. [laughs] Hanna Bächer I think that’s actually quite a good ending to this lecture. Gudrun Gut, is not afraid to say anything... Thank you so much. Gudrun Gut Thank you. Hanna Bächer But we might have questions in this room. We definitely do have microphones. There’s a microphone with a person attached there. Who thought about anything during this last hour and 15 minutes that you want to put out there? There’s somebody. Please introduce yourself. Audience Member Hello, my artist name is Loradeniz and I’m Lora, I’m from Istanbul. So my question will be, you said that, “I don’t want to be comfortable.” Then I was wondering, have you ever felt comfortable and not creative at the same time? So have you been in that phase and then experienced that, “No, this is not working?” Like when I’m peaceful, I can not be creative. So why did you say that? Gudrun Gut That was a bit poppy for me to say this. I answered the question because I don’t have a... To start a new track, I don’t go to the synthesizer because I know I’m very comfortable with it. That’s not a good start to be creative. I’d rather start with something I don’t know, just for the process. But sure, you have to be comfortable, at one point. Otherwise, it’s a bit of a nightmare. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean this. And I wanted to add something to the last sentence because I think you shouldn’t be afraid, because the mistakes you make are really good for you. I think every mistake brings you further. So that’s why I’m not so afraid to do things. Audience Member Thank you. Audience Member Hello, my artist name is Perel. Gudrun Gut I know you. Audience Member Yeah, thank you. I really, really, really like your track with Âme together on their LP, and I wanted to know how do you know each other? Is it just like the Uckermark friendship? Because I know they also have a house there and, I don’t know. Not at all? No? Gudrun Gut No, no, no. Audience Member I was just curious, how did this happen? Gudrun Gut Thank you very much, yeah because we didn’t mention this. I did this wonderful track with Âme. It happened because they asked... We went to the Sacred Ground Festival, me and Thomas Fehlmann, and then Frank Wiedemann asked us to join in for the soundtrack of Symphony of Now, which is a production movie about the old symphony, Die Sinfonie der Großstadt, but made today and Frank Wiedemann asked several collaborators to write new music for it, which is pretty cool. Gudrun Gut And while we did this session, he asked me if I would join in on the Âme album and it was like... [snaps fingers three times] And it was great fun to play at Royal Albert Hall on that track. Hanna Bächer In London? Gudrun Gut Yeah. Audience Member Hi, we met. We were interviewed together, yeah, if you remember. I wanted to... Gudrun Gut Close to here. Audience Member Yeah, so what is it like being a woman in the music industry? No. I’m joking, that’s what they asked us and all three of us were like, “Oh my God, again!” Anyways, I wanted to ask you, because you’ve been involved in music for so many years and scenes and you’ve seen so many things go up and down, what do you think about new artists and the new music scenes now? Do you still find it very exciting and new? Which artists do you think are really exciting for you, and original, and just in general, what would you think about new music being put out these days? Gudrun Gut There’s always good and bad music. I mean there’s no bad music. I don’t know. There’s interesting stuff and some stuff is not so interesting. Audience Member What do you like? Gudrun Gut What do I like? I wouldn’t know. I’m not suggesting anything. Hanna Bächer Just follow Monika Enterprises and then... Gudrun Gut Somebody else signs it. Audience Member Hi, I’m Ylia, I come from Barcelona and I am starting a new label and I know some of the other participants are doing that too. So I wonder if you’ve got some advice, regarding to that. Gudrun Gut Do you want to start a digital label or with real distribution? Do you have a distributor? Audience Member No. Gudrun Gut [laughs] It’s very hard to get a distributor. I would definitely do that, find a distributor as soon as possible. Or I really like Bandcamp actually. I think it’s a really good start, because you can control your fans, you can communicate, you can talk to the people who are interested, you can connect. And yeah, that’s something. Don’t spend too much money on promotion, [laughs] because it’s a waste of money. Hanna Bächer It looked like there was someone else but now I feel like everyone’s moving their hands. Audience Member Hi, I’m Octavio from Mexico and I wanted to ask you what’s the best part of all these years of experience and exploration? Gudrun Gut I think the best part is that it’s still going on. When I was 20, I could never imagine sitting here at 60 and still being in the music industry and still getting excited about music. And be happy. I’m much happier now then when I was 20. I think in general, when you get older, you are much more relaxed about life and I think that’s a good thing, because when I was 20, I couldn’t even imagine being 30. So that’s a really wonderful experience for me, age. Audience Member What is the best advice you can give to people who are like me, they’re in their mid careers or starting their careers or... Gudrun Gut Believe in yourself, trust yourself, communicate with others, build collectives. Collectives. Yeah, and do good music. Audience Member Thanks. Hanna Bächer [applause] Thank you again.
[applause] This was Mania D with “Herzschlag.” And who did we see in this still?
[applause] Malaria! live with “Kaltes Klares Wasser.” And I mentioned before that Beate was and still is a sound engineer. How did you sync stuff on stage with all these instruments changing, etc. How did you still make it tight?
[applause] “Your Turn To Run.”
A track called “Garten,” well, obviously... garden.
That’s you and Blixa.
[applause] A band called Quarks.
[applause] Cobra Killer with “Mund Auf, Augen Zu,” who were around Berlin forever, pretty much, right? They did stuff in the mid-’90s and still continue. I think this is from 2004, actually. From Monika Enterprises, your label. Your role in that label, apart from reaching out to artists and getting them to release stuff on your label, where that expanded to being a producer in these collectives, right?

Title: Jam City

Jam City
The roster for UK electronic label Night Slugs is stacked with talent, so it’s no small praise to say that British producer, songwriter and DJ Jack Latham, AKA Jam City, is one of the label’s most prominent artists. His 2012 debut, Classical Curves, is already recognized as a modern classic, lauded for its fusion of glinting, melody-driven club music and concussive percussion. However, his second album, Dream A Garden, marked a dramatic break from that style, instead favoring an electronic-infused dream pop. As dynamic as he is in his solo work, Latham displays even greater versatility in his collaborative projects. For instance, Latham produced the bulk of Kelela’s electro-R&B album Take Me Apart, which topped numerous year-end lists in 2017. When he isn’t in the studio, Latham DJs at festivals and in clubs around the world. He also puts on his Earthly parties, which aim to create a safe, tolerant space for clubgoers, and has released a series of widely-heralded Earthly mixes.
In his lecture at Red Bull Music Academy Berlin 2018, Latham discussed getting his club music education in London, the power of minimalism and the psychology of pop production.
Hosted by Lauren Martin Hello everybody, thank you very much for coming to another lecture. Our guest this afternoon is a musician and a songwriter from the UK. His work has taken him from dancefloors in London to recording studios in LA and to pop shows all over the world. He’s a self-taught musician who creates his own musical world, and now in recent years has helped other people create their own. So please help me welcome Jam City. [applause] Jam City Thank you. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it. Lauren Martin You’re very welcome. The outfit is amazing today I have to say. Jam City Thanks Lauren. You know I had to make an effort. Lauren Martin This is very pop-pirate. I’m loving it. OK, so... Here you need a microphone. OK, let’s set a scene. It’s 2 AM in the morning in London and you’re in a club. It’s very dark and it’s very loud and there’s bodies moving around everywhere. What do you, the musician, pay attention to in moments like that? Jam City 2 AM? Lauren Martin Maybe not very much at 2 AM but you know. Jam City What do I pay attention to? I mean I’m sort of trying to think about my formative musical experiences, I suppose. Going to clubs and enjoying myself and staying out all night and that sort of thing. Wait, is this as a producer, DJ, musician or just someone on the dance floor? Lauren Martin A mixture of all. I want to get inside your head, you know. Jam City Yeah, I mean the thing I suppose I come back to time and time again is the most simple thing which is just listening to music really, really loud with other people, and obviously a nightclub is the place to do that. But I’ve been going to music, and live music, all my life. My best memories in life, in general, are house parties where someone takes over stereo, and it’s good as well, it’s not like, “Come on mate.” Right? It’s something about hearing music really, really loud with other people, and that really can be anywhere. It could be a nightclub, it could be in someone’s bedroom, it could be wherever. I think it’s that point that you sort of lose yourself in it, and the volume helps you lose yourself in it and the feeling of collectivity that everyone is on a similar wavelength is one of the best feelings in the world. So I think that’s how I feel with that point, maybe. Joy is the word. I feel joyous. Lauren Martin Joy in volume. Jam City Yes. Yeah exactly. That’s a good one yeah. Lauren Martin So whereabouts would you go and listen to this very loud music? You’re from South London right? Jam City I’m not from South London. Lauren Martin Dang. Jam City I mean no, you’re right. I grew up outside of London and I moved to South London, I went to study fine art, actually. I’m from... It felt isolated growing up, I suppose, in the sense that I was really obsessed with music. I didn’t feel like I fit in, I didn’t feel like anyone understood me, and the moment I was able to get a maintenance grant and go and move to a city is... I’m sure that was really transformative for me. And so when I was going out at that time, I’m sure someone my age probably missed the successive golden eras of rave, punk, house music, even two-step, my sister was big into two-step garage so I kind of got that secondhand. But yeah still, having said that, when I first got to London it felt like a very... I just was drunk on going to see music and going out. I was like a kid in a candy store, I suppose. Some of the places that I was going... Night Slugs were starting to do raves in squats and stuff, and that was a whole mixture of music and people at those. I used to go to Horse Meat Disco a lot as well and really got an education in disco and funk and soul music from there. I caught one or two of the early DMZ as well. I was at DMZ where Kode 9 played “Sign O’ The Times” by Prince, peak time. That was mind blowing. And yeah, it was just a multitude of different music, different culture to just dive right into. I got a musical education from that, that I don’t think I could have got in the same way had I been stuck on my own in an isolated community, or whatever. I had to go out there and experience it and it was brilliant. Lauren Martin So apart from being in love with the volume and the joy, and not wanting to be isolated... That grabbed you first, but then as a musician what made you stick around and start getting involved in producing electronic music? Jam City Well, I mean it’s funny, I always wanted to be in a band, basically, and I could never find like-minded people to do that with. So really making music for DJing in clubs was a really expedient and easy way to start expressing myself musically. Just basically making edits, doing some simple things. And also, I went to art school to study fine art, but I didn’t really want to do that necessarily, and I was very, very lucky and very privileged to have the time to figure out what I wanted to do, and that was three years I spent studying effectively. Really just three years where I learned how to make music from the ground up. I played guitar a little bit when I was younger, but not very seriously, and I didn’t have any musical education. Going out, getting that education that way, and also having the time to experiment, having the time to make mistakes and learn how to make music on my own and with the help of friends and people who’s DJing it as well. People to validate you, people to be like, “Oh yeah I’m going to play your song out” when we’re in a club, or whatever. All of that was my way into making music and was particularly... I was lucky in that I got that really, I had that support and I had that time to figure it out for myself, I suppose, yeah. Lauren Martin When you were studying fine art you said you didn’t want to go on and use fine art in your professional life, but were there any disciplines, ways of working, ways of thinking about the world, that fit into what you did musically at all or were they separate concerns? Jam City No, I think it all was part of the same thing in a way. I mean in the UK for art schools there’s... I don’t even know if they do it anymore but it’s a foundation year and it’s free. I ‘d travel up to London every day and just did this for a year, did this free course where... It was the best year of education I’ve had in my life and it was because the bar... Maybe a bit unfair on myself but the bar was very low in the sense that they were interested in people who just wanted to come, people who were just passionate about doing things, not necessarily that you had the skills or whatever, because I’m not a particularly good visual artist. So what happened with that is that I had a year of an art foundation that was honestly really formative and really life changing because I had teachers that cared enough to teach me things and impart things as well that had nothing to do with music, really, but just having a figure who’s going to be like, “You should look at this” or, “You should look at this” or “Have you ever thought about this? Go to the library and rent out these films.” It’s just this constant unlocking of doors, and unlocking of secret knowledge that is often kept in quite elite reserve, and it’s quite out of access to a lot of people. And absolutely yeah, that year of free education with some really dedicated and amazing people who I was lucky enough to have as my tutors completely gave me a bunch of tools, I suppose, to think about things when I started to make music. And it’s always indirect, but I think if nothing else it’s just a curiosity and a sense of support as well, that you can do these things. So yeah, absolutely, I definitely had things that were imparted, that year particularly, that were essential to me as a person, I think yeah. Lauren Martin So you’re going out, you’re making music, and you released your debut album in 2012, it’s called Classical Curves. Now what made you decide to write an album at that time? What were you particularly interested in? You say you’re a very curious person, a creative person, that got to unlock all these doors and open up your mind. What made you decide that you were going to channel all that into making an album of music? Jam City Well I mean, I suppose I’ve just got confident enough to feel like I had just enough of the music making tools to say something that was a bit more in line with... Obviously when you start making music it’s natural and it’s essential that you copy other people and you learn how to do what you want to do. But that was the first point in my life where I felt like I had something to say for myself. I guess the context is that I’d been DJing for a few years around London and stuff, pretty small stuff, and stuff that Night Slugs were playing and the stuff we were enjoying was really very fun, it was colorful, it was very heavily influenced by both sides of the Atlantic, American Hip-Hop and club culture, and also UK music, of course. Yeah, I remember it being a real fun time musically. Jam City Then I think when I’d released a few little releases and I started to DJ a bit more and I think collectively everyone at Night Slugs were getting a bit fed up with the music that other people were making, because there was just a bit of a sea change in 2010... Maybe not, maybe a bit later than that, 2011 or whatever, where everyone just started to make techno. I love techno but just suddenly what was once very colorful and interesting and didn’t take ourselves too seriously got a bit macho, got a bit coke-y. Not naming any producers names at all, whatever, it is what it is, but it was just a time for me where I just felt not really into the stuff that’s being played on the dance floors around me. I remember having that conversation with Alex Bok Bok and had kind of the same thing. And I think that was a good point for me to think, “You know what, now is a good time to just try and do something that’s a bit more...” Or just try and explore some other ideas. Yeah, it’s as simple as that really. It’s just, “Now is a good time to go off on this route.” Yeah. Lauren Martin As simple as that. Let’s hear a track from that album then. This track is called “How We Relate To The Body,” and it’s taken from... Which is a fantastic title, it’s great. And this is taken from your debut album on Night Slugs in 2012 called Classical Curves. (music: Jam City – “How We Relate To The Body”)
Jam City Yeah, absolutely. Lauren Martin It’s lovely. So when you were talking about going out in London, going to different parties, but hearing sounds that are very synonymous with both the UK and the US, there’s lots of things in a track like that that feel like you’re taking these symbolic sounds, like you’ve got the cold drum machine sounds of grime, you’ve got clubby breaks, garage swings, but you’re making it all feel very interconnected and soft and woven together. Tell me a little bit more about how you created the sound of this record in a track like that. What was your process? Jam City Well I suppose there was three... I mean that’s a good one to play because there was three things that I was really into at the time. One was club music from America, another was, very specifically, Ron Trent and his keyboard playing. Ron Trent has got a very, very specific style of playing house-y keyboard vamps that I was really, really consciously trying to replicate in some way, and the other thing was increasing interest in minimalism and trying to see how far you could strip something back to its raw elements, and club music is particular... Or just DJ music, dance music, or whatever, is a particularly good place to do that, especially when you’re listening to things loud. I think there are always rewards when you strip things back. So yeah, that was... Those three things were all floating around and came together in something like that. Yeah. Lauren Martin Rewards is a really nice word to use. What do you mean by rewards? Jam City I mean I suppose, on an obvious level, when something drops and you can just hear one thing and there’s a lot of clarity in it, it’s particularly satisfying. There’s a directness there that’s quite satisfying. Yeah, it sounds satisfying to me, that’s, I suppose, what it is, yeah. Lauren Martin Personal satisfaction. Jam City Yeah. I can’t quite describe why I like that, but I do. Lauren Martin I’m glad you do, it’s your music. Tell me a little bit then about what you’re using to make this music, ’cause you used quite a simple setup and you’re not really a gear head so much, as it were. Tell me a little bit about what’s in front of you. Jam City Just Ableton and a MIDI keyboard, and that’s it. Especially for that record I think it was like... I mean, I’ve since become, for my sins, a bit of a plugin head, but yeah for that record it’s pretty much just stock sounds. I mean the one thing that I did on that record that has since become my favorite thing to do, I suppose... If I have anything like a signature it’s just really close reverbs. Again I can’t quite describe why I like that, but there’s just a kind of.. It sounds like everything’s recorded in a bathroom basically, like a tile bathroom, or something, and it feels lovely to me. I don’t know why that is, but yeah, I love that. So that’s all I really did. And also, with that record as well it’s... Again music production for me is a constant education process, as it should be for everyone, I think. Every little weird sound I stumbled upon that I liked the sound of, it all just comes through trial and error. That particular trick that I use on every single thing ever that I do, it literally just comes from not understanding what wetness is on a reverb, or what economy settings are on a reverb. I still don’t understand them, but I was just, “What happens if I turn this up to 11 and what happens if I turn this down to zero?” Just extreme settings, no subtlety whatever. And that’s the way that I learn how to produce music. I think that when you start with the most extreme end of things and dial it back, you always get interesting results. I do that to this day just to learn things. But yeah, there’s a lot of that in that whole record of just messing around, seeing what sounds good and then having that moment where you’re just, “OK yeah, I don’t know why but something in this sounds right to me so I’m going to run with it.” Lauren Martin Personal satisfaction, again. You said that you’re a self taught musician. You said you played a bit of guitar, a bit of keys, and you’ve got Ableton. If you don’t have the formal training of a musicianship... Most people in this room are self-taught musicians in some way or another so they can all really relate. What kind of listening practices do you have, or little tricks that you do to get yourself into that funk when you’re making music? Jam City What actual, musical... What do you mean exactly? Lauren Martin I mean, do you sit and listen back to the thing you made the day before and think about how you could do it differently? Jam City Oh yeah. Lauren Martin If you’re self taught and you don’t have that formal language what kind of things do you do? Jam City Play to other people, I think. And that’s really hard, I still struggle with that sometimes. And play in a room with people, it’s like the thing I was just saying, you know something works or when it doesn’t when someone else hears it. You can feel the energy in the room shift slightly, “Oh I don’t know about this. [laughs] Maybe I need to go back to the drawing board on this one.” But yeah, I mean there’s all types of techniques, I think, to make yourself a better musician/producer. I mean in all honesty a lot of it is... The hardest thing to do is carving out time and learning. And again, I have the most basic, basic knowledge of theory, and when I say that I really mean basic. Like I know what a minor chord is, it kind of stops there you know. But that took me years to figure out. I was lucky that I had the time to do that, and support to do that. But it pays off, I think. And again, I think especially with electronic music, the tiniest bits of knowledge that you can pick up places can just stretch on for miles and you can use that thing again and again and again. People say the same thing about the guitar. Guitar pop songs are three or four chords repeated again and again and again. And it’s really true. I think that music theory to someone uninitiated, or not schooled in it, is very intimidating and it feels like the preserve of people who have sat in educations and whatnot. But yeah, if you can somehow access it then it really can help you find a language to express yourself in. Yeah. Lauren Martin They often say, to be a really, really good writer, you have to read ten times more than you actually write. What kind of music do you listen to to get in a zone. You’re talking about really lovely four chord pop music with guitars. What kind of people do you go back and listen to and go “Oh, that person really nailed that?” Jam City Honestly, I’ve got a straightforward answer to that and it’s probably disco, Philly soul, and Gamble and Huff, that kind of thing. And why them in particular is because not only is it musically, harmonically, the most rich music there is, symphonic a lot of it really, but it also was made for dance floors and it was made for radio stations and transistor radios I guess, so like that version of laptop speakers from 40 years ago. And how they’re able to... I mean, just those records are just completely mind-blowing and soulful and inspiring and genuinely moving. And I find that that is something that I come back to a lot. Yeah, actually, that music. Yeah, yeah, definitely. That and The Smiths, but, you know... Lauren Martin Not anymore. Jam City Well... Lauren Martin And no Morrissey. Jam City Yeah, I mean, he’s fucked it up. But Johnny Marr’s one of us. He’s a good guy and he’s resolutely left wing. And he was the other half of it, but yeah, you know... [laughs] Lauren Martin So tell me a bit more about your guitar playing, because your guitar has stayed with you a lot more in your recent music. You have a... Actually, let’s listen to something from you second album. Let’s get right into that. Jam City Sure. Lauren Martin Sure. Let’s play a track called “Black Friday.” How about that? Let’s play that one. So this is from your second album. This came out four years after your first one? Jam City Yeah. Four years. 2015, yeah. Lauren Martin Yeah, so here we go. This one is called “Black Friday,” and it’s taken from his album Dream A Garden. (music: Jam City – “Black Friday”)
Jam City [laughs] Yeah. Lauren Martin Tell me about that sound and how you achieved that because I was really fascinated to read that you used almost exactly the same setup to make this album as you did your last, and the sounds are very different. Jam City Yeah. Yeah, same thing. The only difference is there’s a guitar plugged into the interface. And I sing on the record too. Again, yeah, it’s kind of anti-gear, not for any reason other than cost. I couldn’t make noise as well, where I was living. So just plugged it in, didn’t have any amplification. It gives the guitar quite a nice, clean tone. And yeah, again, it’s working with limitations and ending up with something through trial and error that you actually feel says something about your personality. It took me a while to hear that, but even hearing it now, I’m like OK, yeah, that sounds like me, in a way. And that’s a really nice thing to have as well. Like what you were saying about almost listening to something the day after, or trying to have a technique... a trick to get... To see if the thing you’ve made is successful or not. It’s nice to hear that now and feel like whatever it was in that... I don’t know, that I can comfortably listen to and be like yeah, that feels a part of me. It doesn’t feel like I was going off on a tangent or something. But yeah, I don’t know. Lauren Martin Well, the way that you described the room that you made it in then is actually really appropriate, because to me this sounds like songs of and for a very specific environment. And I remember you said right at the start, the joy of club music, of electronic music is volume, the impact of volume, and this was made maybe in headphones in your room where you couldn’t make noise? Jam City Yeah, mainly. Yeah, just again, kind of a budget setup. And again, I grew up... I love guitar music, I love rock music. And but I also grew up in the indie years, which was sort of the worst period for culture since the 1950s. [laughs] Lauren Martin Why’s that? Jam City It was just terrible. It was just terrible. Bad memories. But you know, in all seriousness, at the same time, that was a golden age for American hip-hop and I remember just being really into guitars and guitar music, and then suddenly there was this popular form of guitar music. But it just didn’t really feel interesting anymore. And yes, I feel there’s so much baggage as well with the guitar, and again, it’s about having amplification and space to practice in. You know, I suppose it feels quite nice to just... I don’t want to say reclaim it, because I don’t own it. But do you know what I mean? And actually, I mean I keep hearing really great new artists and songwriters that are probably using a similar setup for cost reasons and everything, and I feel almost like there’s a new wave of really interesting guitar-centered electronic music maybe I can’t think of any examples off the top of my head. But yeah. It’s a beautiful instrument. And one thing as well with playing it, I find it slows me down and it slows the production process down a lot, and that’s really good because I think that sometimes music production software can almost answer your questions for you. And that’s great because it means you make stuff a lot quicker, but when I have to sit in front of a guitar, I have to really concentrate and I have to really think about what it is I’m trying to do, and the results always feel a bit more interesting. And again, I don’t really like the word, but honest, because I’ve just taken a bit of time to really think what I’m doing. Lauren Martin Do you mean almost like, when you say reclaim but you don’t own them, you mean reclaim them from the indie, macho loudness wars and just put it back into a private space? Jam City Yeah, I suppose so. I really don’t want to be on record saying I reclaimed guitars at all. But I suppose I just... They’re also a relatively easy instrument to learn, comparatively, that’s what punk was all about, really, and it’s a great addition to all the types of things you can do with a laptop and a DAW. So yeah, I don’t know, I like the sound of guitars, I really do, and they make me go to a very personal place and make me think about very deep memories and stuff like that. It’s a sound that feels very meaningful to me in whatever context it is, however it’s processed, or whatever it feels like. It kind of triggers something deep in my subconscious that whenever I hear it, it feels really meaningful to me. Lauren Martin You also used your voice on this record and it’s kind of the first time we get to hear you with your voice in there and it’s, again, it’s smudged in with the general effect of the sound. Tell me a little bit about... You maybe didn’t have a choice financially in what you were using, but there are aesthetic choices that you make when you make your own music. So tell me about that aesthetic choice. Jam City Yeah, I mean, it was just like... I’ve always been... I mean, I think obviously everyone is drawn to songs. And I think it took me a while to figure out how to do that, but I always wanted to do that. And even on Classical Curves there’s weird little snatches of vocals and breaths and things buried in the mix. And it just feels like you’re hijacking the song by inserting yourself into it. And again, it feels good, it feels like a part of you. You embedded something quite pure... Not pure, I don’t like that word. You’ve embedded something quite meaningful, and maybe vulnerable as well, deep into the fabric of the sounds. And I say that as a listener really, mainly. I’m always compelled to songs with voices. Singing, spoken word, rapping, whatever. It’s just the hook that draws me in, you know? That and... Yeah, absolutely. Lauren Martin There’s something very warmly ambiguous about this kind of sound, that you’re able to put a sound out... Not even about being madly in love or being depressed or a triumph or a sorrow. It’s about these gray spaces where you just want to be left alone. Is that something that you think about when you’re making music? Jam City What, wanting to be left alone? [laughs] No, I think... I mean, I suppose what you said at the start as well, being somewhere around other people, listening to music. That is sort of important to me. I mean, another thing as well is that I never want to... The one thing I really don’t want to have is an artistic temperament in my life. I really strive to not be that person that’s just, “Give me my solitude to create.” Like seal me in my anechoic chamber and no one knows my genius has been expelled. And again, I think it speaks to the conditions under which a lot of us probably make music, is that we’re doing it wherever we can, whenever we can. And so there’s perhaps something in that then that... I don’t know, you use whatever spaces you can to get as deep as possible inside yourself. But you also come out of that and are a nice person. I mean, I guess I just think about this a lot, the conditions under which you need to create music, and I’ve never had a studio, and I think occasionally I don’t quite like working in studios. But, you know, you use what you have and I think you can... I never want to be sealed off from the world when I create. I like being around people, and I actually like working in cafes as well. Occasionally. I don’t always have to, particularly now, but it’s nice to be around people and be a functioning member of society and just... It’s a job like any other. You’re just getting on with it and using that time and that space to get as deep inside yourself as you can. Lauren Martin So speaking of studio, as in other people, we’ve talked a lot about you, so let’s talk about the other people that you work with. You played quite a big role as a writer and a co-producer on an album by an artist called Kelela. Her album came out... Actually, I realized it was this week, exactly a year ago, that her album came out. Jam City Wow, time flies. Lauren Martin So there’s a singer from Washington, DC, called Kelela, and she put out an album last year called Take Me Apart, which you played a big role in. And I would like to play, in full... Jam City The Kelela fans in the audience. Lauren Martin Yeah, if we’ve got some Kelela, we’re happy. [applause] Jam City Feels good. Lauren Martin You have arrived, sir. Jam City Oh you know, give it... Lauren Martin Can we please have video number three in full, please? (video: Kelela – “Frontline”)
Jam City Kelela. Lauren Martin But you’re in there too. Jam City Ladies and gentlemen, Kelela. Lauren Martin Ladies and gentlemen, Kelela. She is amazing. Now we’ve talked a lot about you and the very private, intuitive way of making music. Now you go in and work with a vocalist, another person in the room, tell me about making that creative leap into that space. Jam City Yeah, I mean, I was kind of dropped in the deep end a little bit, in that I lived in America for a little bit. I lived on the east coast and then I lived in LA for a year. And when I first moved there, I got set up on a session at Jason Derulo’s house. Lauren Martin Oh wow. Jam City So yeah. I didn’t meet the man. Sadly, I didn’t make the album. I was really nervous. Kelela and I worked together on some stuff, but it was always over email. And it was when I was in LA that I got more involved with that record. But yeah, in terms of working with other people, that was literally one of my first sessions, and it’s weird because, as I say, making music on your own... I did two solo records by that point, and it was... It gets very, very myopic and claustrophobic, in a way. And I kinda feel... I love making music on my own, but I feel that getting into production for other people and co-writing with people more kind of saved me from insanity a little bit, because like I said, I always wanted to be in a band, and suddenly you can be in that situation with other people where you’re just bouncing ideas off of each other. And so this first session I had in this crazy mansion, an empty house, Jason Derulo in residence. What surprised me was going into as someone who makes quite personal music, or niche music. You know, the stuff we’ve played earlier is very specific to me and who I am. Going to that situation feeling like how the fuck am I going to be useful to these people in any way? How do I fit into this puzzle? But the thing I found out that day, and has honestly subsequently not really changed in any of the people I’ve met for sessions and worked with, whether they’ve gone somewhere or whether they haven’t gone anyway, is just how lovely people are. And I really mean that, in the sense that I’ve never... Don’t get me wrong, there are difficult times when you’re working with someone else, but I feel that I’m lucky enough to have all the experiences I’ve had working with other people is that they all always start off at this place of emotional vulnerability that you both have to enter before you can do anything. So you have this weird thing where you have to get very, very deep with someone very, very quickly. And that doesn’t feel intimidating at all. And that feels, actually, very nourishing. And yeah, then I remember this session I had right at the start of this whole process was just, you just sit around, and yeah, you play your favorite records for people for hours and hours. And you talk about this and that and you learn stuff. And again, I’m continuing my musical education through other people. The amount of things I’ve learned off other people in sessions is just insane. I was working with another writer, Sarah Aarons, who’s an amazing songwriter, and ended up getting a piano lesson from her. And it’s just these kind of situations where, whilst they are high pressure on the surface, they can be really quite beautiful and quite nourishing and it’s a kind of a new phase of my career, I guess, in the last two or three years where I’ve been doing more and more of that, that I really love and is kind of integral to me as a musician now, you know? It’s always getting in the room with someone else and seeing what happens, you know? Lauren Martin A lot of people in this room are becoming adults at a time when there’s so many conversations about power and the dynamics between people, especially between men and women. And young men and women are always having now to rethink how they talk to each other, how we interact with one another, how to do that with kindness and awareness, and all these things. And we all try to live our lives in that way. When you go into a studio with other people, especially women, especially black women, what kind of conversations do you have about how to best represent their ideas and how best to get them down on paper and then, on a record, in a way that feels, like you say, nourishing and honest without being exploitative? Jam City That’s a good question. But I mean, it’s also... It’s simple. You literally just go and try and make good music. And honestly, 80% of the time, I’m just in the background, just trying to help organize someone’s thoughts. And I really mean this in a nice way, but I feel like again, my role as a producer, or whatever, a co-writer, in a lot of ways is to... You end up being someone’s therapist. And I think that it’s the same for me as well, a little bit. But I’m fine to play that role. One thing about producing is that working with other people is the... You learn very quickly that your idea isn’t always the best one in the room. And someone’s always got a better idea than you. And to be honest, if you don’t get over that, then things go south very quickly. But as long as you just go in and you just want to make a good song, and again, 99% of the time that’s what the goal is in the session. Sit there and listen, and at times, I’ll steer it in a direction or I’ll have a suggestion for a different... For something that that artist just can’t do themselves. But we’ll establish a point where we want to get to. And then it’s just about getting to that point in the song, and nothing else really matters. And along the way, you have a lot of really deep conversations. You have a lot of very enlightening conversations, and I’ve again, I’ve learnt so much from other people, on a musical level, on a personal level, on a political level. I’m just grateful that I can actually do this as part of my job. It’s that curiosity that you’re talking about. I don’t really have a point to prove, working with people, whoever they are, I just kinda want to make a good song and I’m down for that to lead me wherever it goes. However left field that takes us, then let’s just follow it. Go down the rabbit hole and see what happens, and I’m down for the ride, really. I really don’t want to start and be like, “So why don’t we do things my way?” You know? ‘Cause it just doesn’t work. Lauren Martin When we’re talking about being a self-taught musician, having these ways of working that aren’t so formalized or come from training, I remember speaking to Kelela maybe about a year before the album came out, and she was speaking about having quite a visual way of explaining herself, and she was talk about working with Arca on the album. And she would say things like, “This song is about hips. She needs more wind in her hair. We need to go up a mountain.” Saying all these story-telling kinda cues to give hints for the mood of the music. Did you ever have little conversations about... Jam City Yeah, that’s Kelela language. So I’m fluent in it now, but it took me a while. But yeah, you learn to take cues from other people. And that’s me, a lot of the time, ‘cause I don’t know how to express myself through theory, really, so I’m just being the one in the room that’s like, “More,” or whatever. Like, “More this,” or, “More that.” Or, like, “It’s just not quite working,” or like... Every single time you meet someone new, they’ve got their own language of getting things across and you pick that up pretty quickly, you learn to read their cues and try and get to that point where you’ve got a really cool thing that’s in the making. Lauren Martin Do you feel like your language has changed, then? Maybe not the same as Kelela’s, up the mountain, but, you know, do you feel like your language, about how to communicate about what you want out of a song has changed from collaborating? Jam City Yeah. Well, it changes every single different session. But that’s why that time at the start of the session is so important to literally just trade YouTube links and just talk about life, talk about what you’re going through. And yeah, you pick up a way of working together very quickly. And yeah, also the thing you said about Kelela is that, it’s effectively... It’s kind of a visual thing, and that’s a really good, easy way for me to work, as well, ‘cause you’re just like, “This needs to be more...” You know? You can find a way to interpret on your own terms, but you effectively understand what she’s saying ‘cause there’s an image there, and there’s a sort of vision there, like a little film or something. So that’s kind of an easy way to work, definitely. Lauren Martin I’d like to play a track by another vocalist that you’ve worked with quite recently. He’s called Troye Sivan. He’s an Australian singer, and you contributed to some of his most recent album, Bloom. Jam City Yes. Lauren Martin Yes. It’s a amazing record. This is the last track on the album, “Animal.” Jam City Yep. Lauren Martin Is it the last one? Yeah. I love this record. So who else worked on this record with you? Jam City A lot of people. Lauren Martin A lot of people. Jam City Yeah. Bram Inscore, Alex Hope, other people, Ariel Rechtshaid, on this one, as well. And it’s again, Troye’s an interesting one because he’s a real music head, and he had this really cool playlist that he sent to us before he started work on the record that had The Replacements on it, and it had a lot of kind of new wave, a lot of goth-rock. All things that I love, and again, when an artist comes in and they give you those things to work with, like saying, “This is my kinda language. I know I’m a pop star but this is the feeling that I wanna draw on, and just do it Troye Sivan style,” then it’s like a gift, ‘cause you’re just like, “This is brilliant. This is so much to work with, here. We can go off in any direction, I know exactly what to do.” And also with Troye as well, there’s another one that he did on there, called “The Good Side,” and weirdly, it was a nice... There’s a bit at the end where there’s just four bass notes repeating, on a loop. And it was a nice, weird little throwback to Classical Curves, in a way, ‘cause it’s just this weird thing, where it was just super minimal, only lasted for four bars. And it was just this nice little full circle moment where I felt that’s just the kind of thing that I would have wanted to do back then, but it was in a totally different context, so that felt good. But yeah, “Animal” is another one, and a lot of amazing people worked on that behind the scenes. And yeah, Troye. Lauren Martin Let’s listen to “Animal” by Troye Sivan. (music: Troye Sivan – “Animal”)
Jam City Yeah, I mean again, it’s learning so much from other people. And it’s learning technical things, like how to put together a song, and learning about other people’s experiences that make you reevaluate your own. And you take all of that back into your own work. I actually haven’t had much time to work on my own music for a while now, actually,’cause I’ve kinda been sucked into this world, and I love it, and I kinda don’t wanna stop, but I do also want to work on my own music. And I think that yeah, I don’t know. It’s just I’ve gained so much confidence from other people as well, who’ve sort of encouraged... I mean, Kelela as well, would force me to play things live on the keyboard, and it’s just... And that is invaluable, to have someone else be like, “No, no, no you’re heading in the right direction. Keep doing that.” And yeah, you take all that and you put it back into your own music. And, I don’t know. Working with other people teaches you to be really patient, as well. And teaches you how to really listen to other people and to what they’ve entrusted with you to get across as well. So you know, these are all skills that can be applied anywhere. And in life, as well. Music aside for a moment, I like to think that the work I do as a musician has some positive relationship with who I am just as a person. And I mean, it’s not for me whether to say whether that’s successful or not, but I’d like to think that the things you learn about when you have to work with people under those very, very specific and quite hard conditions sometimes, you bring back into your own life, aside from, you know, your solo records. Yeah, so I mean, hope kinda has a positive impact there, as well. Lauren Martin Well, it seems to be working fine musically, so I’m sure everybody thinks you’re just lovely. Don’t worry. Jam City Thanks, guys. Lauren Martin So you are actively working on some solo things, in a sense. Jam City Always, yeah, always. Lauren Martin Oh, hello? No, no you’re there. Don’t worry. Jam City Hello? Lauren Martin Hello. Hello, again. You are working on things within the Jam City universe, not just Jack in the studio with other people. You started a label this week. Jam City Yeah, unofficially, yeah. It’s just a home. It’s a home for things that I just really like, and I think deserve to be heard. So yeah, it’s a label in that sense, yeah. Lauren Martin And can you tell me some more about it? Jam City I think one thing is there’s so much music that gets made now to a point where it’s got a bit ridiculous for me, because there’s just hours and hours of music that I’ve made with other people, that other people have sent me to work on, and a lot of it’s really lovely. And also I’m at a weird... And very grateful to be at a point where people send me their music just to listen to. And occasionally, you’ll have your mind blown by something. And I mean, this is the case with Fauness, who’s an artist whose record we’re putting out in the... This winter, I guess. Who sent me a bunch of songs and they had such a clear vision. And she’s a singer, songwriter, producer. And yeah, had such clear vision and a unique way of seeing the world and seeing both... Navigating her subject... Position as a woman, and also she has interesting environmental issues as well, and all these things are... I feel make great topics for songs. And it’s rare that I get something where all that has kinda coalesced together, and that was just something that I felt needed to be heard for other people. And her video just came out yesterday, actually. So yeah, it’s a home for voices that I feel I want to be heard, and music that I love. It’s really as simple as that, you know? Lauren Martin Well, let’s watch that video. Jam City Yeah. Lauren Martin Can we watch video number four please? (video: Fauness – “Street Song”)
Jam City The fact that I feel it’s speaking to me directly, and I guess that’s what everyone feels when a song relates directly to their life. No matter who did it and who’s listening to it, it feels like someone is saying something about you and you can get that in top 40 music, you can get that in Troye Sivan, you can get that in Kelela, you can get that in Fauness, whose talking about very specific things. But it’s all pop music to me in a way, I think. And, again, I feel the same about some of the earlier things we were talking about with club music, house music. It’s got a certain economy to it that it’s all about just getting to the listener or the dancer as quickly as possible. And hitting them and their heart as quickly and as efficiently as possible as well I think. So yeah, that’s what pop music is to me. I have a pretty broad definition of what pop music is but, yeah. Transformative pop music. Lauren Martin Transformative, I like that. Jam City, thank you very much. Jam City Thank you so much, thank you. [applause] Lauren Martin Do any participants have a question for Jack? Audience Member Hi. I have a semi-technical question but, yeah, the one thing that always struck me about early Night Slugs stuff, and your stuff in particular, and even your later pop work, is that it’s very focused in a way that there’s not much clutter in the way the song is structured, and you were talking about the beauty of minimalism and a build up-y thing and a very minimally constructed drop part that hits even harder through the minimalism of it. And I wanted to ask you if you have encountered any techniques to help you strip down a song or a structured song to its essentials? Because I always find myself cluttering everything and then... Jam City Yeah, I do as well. And it only gets to a good point where I strip it all out and just, “I’m going to get rid of everything.” But yeah, it’s just editing I guess, just really trying to edit and get rid of as much as possible. And then you pull it all back in at later stages in a song. On a technical level what I quite like, and especially with pop music... Choruses having as few elements as possible musically and then as you go through the song more get added. And that’s something I did in club music as well, with drums. Just get rid of everything for the main motif, apart from the synth or the melody or the kick drum, and then three minutes you can maybe develop that further with some hi-hats, simple as that. It doesn’t always work but for me that’s one of my go to things that works for me a lot of the time. Yeah, getting rid of everything and then putting it back in at later points. Audience Member Hey, this is Octavio. I’m a huge fan of your work and of Night Slugs’ catalog. And I wanted to ask you, how you got this inspiration, for example, on songs like “The Courts,” to grab these tiny microsamples of shoes scratching on the basketball court and all these sounds related to it? Because at the end I feel like a lot of producers right now are using these tools or elements for their songs, but you were doing this back in 2012, and I think that at the end it influenced a lot of the underground club music scene, using these microsamples as percussion elements rather than just background foley. Where did the inspiration to grab these samples come from? Jam City Specifically Timbaland was a big, big influence for me, especially growing up as well, because that was at a time when his music and his productions were everywhere. And obviously the famous examples of the Aaliyah song with the baby crying in it, I can’t remember what that one’s called. I can’t remember anything, so I’m sorry. Yeah, so that. Him specifically was, for me, someone who was using really unconventional sounds in a percussive way, and also just an ambience in the music that sounds slightly strange, gives just an atmosphere to something but in a really simple way. Even adding birdsong and stuff, something that I find myself doing a lot, and it always gives another extra element that’s nice. Lauren Martin Is that also a little bit to do with the element of surprise? People might expect a certain bass sound or a certain drum sound and then it comes in with a bird or someone’s voice. Jam City Yeah, and another thing I like doing is, I don’t know why, but if there’s a bassline that comes in, a dark heavy bassline, like a Reese bass, I layer that with a bird sound. And, again, it’s just this weird juxtaposition that feels weird but just puts you in a weird space where you’re meant to feel two things at once. And I always love that feeling when your heart’s being pulled in two directions at once. Yeah, I quite like doing that. It’s all just Timbaland basically. [laughs] Audience Member Hi Jack. My name is Tommy. Jam City [looks around the room] Sorry, I don’t know where everyone is. Audience Member My name is Tommy and I’m from South London. Got to say, very inspiring in terms of someone who just blends a world of indie sound but makes it acceptable in the sonic world of club music as well. I find that a really interesting balance, that you bridge this gap, which I don’t think anyone’s really pulled off before. But I was just going to ask, obviously you’ve been focusing quite a lot on songwriting, particularly enjoyed the Clara La San mixtape that you did recently. Jam City Yeah, she’s amazing. Audience Member Incredible. Jam City Yeah, Clara La San, for anyone who doesn’t know, is a singer-songwriter from Manchester and she put out a mixtape that I just feel begetted to shout-out because it’s so fucking good. And you’ll unquestionably be hearing more from her somehow soon. She’s amazing. Audience Member I hope so. I think she definitely, with the stuff she did with Scratcha [DVA] for example and with a lot of the Gang Fatale lot, I think a vocalist who definitely captures what I think we should do to this club sound, where I don’t think anyone else has really bridged that gap before either. So actually, yeah, it’s quite funny, because both you working together, bridging a gap which was quite unique. So you’ve been focusing on the songwriting front, but as a club producer, is there anything that you’ve got planned that maybe you could just shed some light on? And even also, what’s your idea of the sonic landscape in terms of club music in London and have you been listening to anything recently that’s perked your interest? Jam City Yeah, I’d be lying if I said I was fully abreast of stuff. I need someone to show me what’s going on because I’ve just been in a bit of a hole recently, sadly, because I miss finding new music, I really do. But I make club music or hip-hop instrumentals all the time. I never really stopped making stuff that we played earlier on from Classical Curves, the Club Constructions type things because it’s so fun and it’s so easy as well, it’s just, you don’t think too much about it, you literally just get a groove going and then that’s that. Yeah, there’s a lot of that stuff that I continue to make because I really love it. Not really any plans to release it at the moment but it will come out somehow and also I like vocalists and I like... It would only really make sense for those things to have someone jump on them. I think that would be worthwhile for them to be heard. Lauren Martin There’s also, you have your Earthly mixtapes, which are a really nice gap between that... So Earthly is the name of the label, but there are original productions and edits and remixes in these half-hour to hour-long mixtapes that you put out online. Jam City Yeah, definitely. A mix is just a great way of working out your ideas and threading together the things that are informing you and figuring all that out. And in a way Earthly, as a label thing, is just basically the same thing. It’s just things that aren’t me but feel like they speak to me in some way. And, yeah, they’re fun to do as well. It’s a nice way of arranging your… That’s an art school thing in a way, because we were always really encouraged to record everything and keep sketchbooks and it’s just like a sketchbook of just things that are loose and around. You feel like they mean something bigger than the sum of their parts, group them together, move on to the next thing. Lauren Martin I think especially with the music you make, mixes are just a legitimate form of putting music out into the world as an album in many respects. Jam City Yeah, especially if they’re your own music, especially if they are your… The last Earthly mixtape was more my productions and collaborations with some other people and, yeah, every year or two now it feels good to just gather everything up that doesn’t have a home at that point and put it all together. And it’s a nice marker of time as well to be like, “Yeah, this was a period where I was really into this or this or that,” and you can go back and draw on it. It’s fun to do. Lauren Martin Did you have a question as well? Yeah. Audience Member Hello, I’m Sequoyah, I’m from Atlanta. Jam City Nice to meet you. Audience Member Nice to meet you as well. So on huge pop songs, like the song “Frontline” with Kelela, or the song “Animal” that you did with Troye, I know that the production teams are a big collaborative effort. So you mentioned that you came in, Ariel Rechtshaid came in, there’s a lot of other people too that you said work more behind the scenes. So I’m interested in knowing, on songs like that, is there a person, a producer, whose specific task it is to provide the unifying sound for huge songs like that? Like the subtle autotune or the... Do you know what I mean? Maybe the trappish-type sounds. Because in those three songs, although they’re from different artists, there are unifying factors that let you know that it’s pop music from 2018, do you know what I mean? But at the same time I’m wondering if it’s your job to bring in the very individual sound or your own specific flavor to the mix, but then once different producers come in who bring their subtle individual flavor, is there someone who’s there, who’s like, “OK, and now I have to put it...” I don’t know how to explain it, almost put this lens on it that makes it pop. Once you add your flavor do they come in and add the autotune and the... Jam City Yeah, it’s a really good question. I think the short answer is it changes constantly and one thing about working with other people is... Audience Member Changes? How the industry changes? Jam City Yeah, but also artist to artist. All artists want different things and all artists want different things of different parts of you for when you work together. The Kelela record, for example, I’m credited on that as an executive producer, whatever that means, but on a real level a lot of that is just because, aside from the four or five songs that I wrote and produced for it, it was my task to just, as you said, smooth things out and unify things to be honest. Audience Member So in the example of the Kelela album, you were actually that person. Jam City Yeah, in that one I was. Not in the Troye one. And it’s a unique thing to be in and also it’s very specific to me being there at the time and helping out. But it was just things like… What’s the song? God, I can’t remember what it’s called. Audience Member Which track number is it? Jam City I don’t even know. Audience Member I listen to it, I bump it in my car so I know. Jam City Cool. Fuck. It’s the one… Is it “Turn To Dust?” Yeah, so that one was really complicated because it’s mainly Arca who did it, but then I redid it and then it became a job about fusing our two versions together. And so my job in that sense was really to just be an editor and ultimately that was something… And Kelela, it was her job to be an editor too. And she had a vision, she saw a way through all these parts, and it was hard for me to see that at first because there were so many different things going on in the track, hundreds of stems, just absolute fucking bane of my life is stems. I can’t tell you how much I hate them. I hate them so much. Jam City But it was about trying to sift through all of that and just be like, “Is this right? Is this right? Is this right? No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes. OK, we’re moving towards something good.” And that’s nothing musical for me at all, it’s all Alejandro [Ghersi, aka Arca] and Kelela and the writers for that song. But, yeah, your services are required to help someone get through something in a coherent way. Does that answer the question? OK, I’m around, so yeah... Lauren Martin You can definitely catch up in some more detail. Should maybe take the one just back there, yeah. Audience Member Hey. Jam City Hi. Audience Member I really like how you mesh these styles together like goth-rock and post-punk wave with R&B. But this question what I have is, how do you see the future of pop music? I know it’s a difficult question, but do you think that’s a thing, meshing more styles together and just give a shit of it? Going for a specific genre even more? Jam City I mean, if I’m completely honest I really hate the idea that the future of pop music, and this might sound alarmist, is algorithmic or AI-based. I know that sounds a bit sci-fi, but honestly we live in a time, culturally, where everything is… I don’t know what the technical terms are but everything is an algorithm, everything is judged and decided by numbers, basically. And I sometimes meet people when I’m in LA who talk about this like it’s some bold, brave new world and it’s really exciting that we’re going to basically let the machines write the perfect pop songs for us. And obviously I think we’re a bit far off that, of course, but there’s a genuine sentiment to that that those people believe and I fucking hate it and it pisses me off. Not everything can be crowdsourced and algorithmized, or whatever the word is. It’s funny because working collaboratively with lots of people, it happens more and more and more, like credits on a Kanye record, 20 or 30 people in it. And that’s cool in many ways but also it’s this approach that you’re going to reverse engineer the perfect pop song that I think is just fucking ridiculous. And it really annoys me because I just feel like, at its core, you can have whatever technology you need, I very much welcome technological advancements in sound design and also cultures being fused and referenced and meshed together and all these things that are symptomatic of modern pop music. But the one thing that I just feel is just so stupid and I’m really against, is this idea that, yeah, we can... That the answer to a piece of music that moves people and speaks to them can be reverse engineered and can be assembled through this numbers game. Does that make sense? I’m not an expert on these technological things so I don’t really know what I’m talking about, but I see it sometimes and it’s a big change that’s happened with music consumption, more so than the writing stuff. And it’s a big question mark really about the future of pop music specifically, and it’s going to have a knock on effect to the underground because those things are symptomatic. My friend Mat Dryhurst actually, is really good about this stuff. So if you can find him online or something, I feel like he’ll answer your questions. But, yeah, I don’t know if that makes sense. Fuck the machines. [laughs / applause] Lauren Martin Can we maybe take one more? That would be great, thank you. Audience Member Hey, I’m Mira. Really inspired by what you’ve said today. I’m just interested in knowing if you have any specific ways of making yourself comfortable or making people in the room comfortable when you collaborate, for example Kelela? If there is anything special that you want to have in the room or any equipment or elements or thoughts? How to make it flow-y and how to start the flow going. Jam City Yeah, I think it’s probably different for every single artist. Some people that’s not an issue for at all, and they’re just ready to go. I’ve had sessions with people and within five minutes they’re not actually interested in having a conversation and talking about personal life, they literally come in and they’re like, “Right. Beat.” Play ten, 15 beats. “OK, I’ve got an idea.” Half an hour later we’re done. On to the next one, that’s amazing. And also some things, again, it’s about forging a very specific relationship with an... I say friendship really, with an artist that nothing is going to happen musically for maybe a year, but you’re committed enough to what they want to do and you think that there’s amazing potential there and it’s just a process of waiting and forging a sense of trust with them. It’s weird, I actually do find it quite easy to make myself at home with strangers, but I know not everyone is and I know that that’s quite difficult. Yeah, but everyone’s different. I think one turning point I had as well was... Well two things I suppose. One was just learning, as a rule, to go in there with no expectations, but maximum preparation, and just making sure that you’ve got enough things to give them musically. But at the same time having absolutely no... “I’m not going to write anything today.” Let alone something good. So that’s one thing. And the other thing was being prepared to allow anything to make the song. I don’t know how to describe this, it’s almost like this could be our topic [picks up a glass] or this could be [picks up a mug] and it’s not interesting at all but it’s the exact thing that sparks off this chain reaction that someone’s like, “Coffee, OK, black coffee in the morning, OK, waking up, bed, last night, hangover, ex-girlfriend, ex-lover,” or whatever like that. So in a way, that openness to everything, to any direction things are going in, can often be a good way to allow things to happen in a comfortable way. You’re not just like, “I don’t know, are we going to write a song about a coffee cup?” Nothing’s off the table. And I feel like as long as you’re go in with that and you’re... Then I think people respond to that a bit better and a bit more comfortable. Lauren Martin So just a lack of shame and a big heart. Jam City Yeah, and just go where it takes you, I think that’s what’s worked for me. And, don’t get me wrong, I’ve had hundreds of sessions and nothing has come out of it. I’ve had loads of sessions and we’ve written things that I think are amazing but they don’t go anywhere. And it’s just a process. And I’m lucky as well that I have my own music when that world gets a bit too much sometimes, because it does. It can be hard a lot of the time. But then I can retreat for a few months and be like, “Maybe it’s time for me to just make music for myself for a bit and then I’m going to get back into it.“ You know, recharge a little bit.” It’s about that balance I think. Lauren Martin Jam City, thank you very much. Jam City Thank you. Thanks. [applause]
[applause] Nice to hear that on big loud speakers.
[applause] Let’s talk about those guitars. They sound so lush. When I listen to that, I think it feels like you’ve left the guitar out in the sun for too long, it’s become a bit bleached.
[applause] I like how you just said Kelela.
[applause] So we started off with instrumental, electronic music, and we’ve come all the way round to very clear, very personal voices. Lots of space and movement in a very, very different way from what you started out with. You say that you’re lovingly part of a bigger whole when you’re in these kind of sessions, but what has writing really beautiful pop songs with other people taught you about your own sound? Because you’re still a musician in your own right as well as working with everyone. So that kind of juxtaposition, how do you think about that?
[applause] So tell me, after working with R&B and pop vocalists and refiguring your own sound through working with him, what do you like most about pop music?

Title: KitschKrieg

KitschKrieg
KitschKrieg is the production trio of Fizzle, Fiji Kris and awhodat. Known for their work with popular German rap artists Trettmann, Megaloh, Joey Bargeld and Haiyti, KitschKrieg bring a focused, monochromatic aesthetic to every element of their creative output. Their distinct, sparse style draws as much from dancehall and dub as it does from modern hip-hop and defines their work as very much their own. Their KitschKrieg trilogy of EPs with Trettmann marked a new chapter for the artist and helped put the team on the map, while subsequent work on Haityi’s Montenegro Zero album and Trettmann’s #DIY would solidify their status as one of Germany‘s most prolific production outfits in the late 2010s.
In this public lecture as part of Red Bull Music Academy Berlin 2018, the group discussed their early beginnings, leaving their egos behind and how black and white defines both their look and their sound. They also deconstruct “Grauer Beton,” going deep on the intricacies of the Roland TR-808 cowbell in the process.
Hosted by Torsten Schmidt Today’s guests are a lady and two gentlemen who, for the past 3-4 years, have done nothing other than making sure that there’s no reason to be ashamed of our country’s pop music. And therefore it is a special honor for me to give a warm welcome to these guys. KitschKrieg. [applause] Fiji Kris Hi Fizzle Hi Torsten Schmidt It’s also a special premiere, because for the first time ever, we have all members of KitschKrieg sitting on one couch. Fiji Kris Applause for awhodat. Fizzle Chingching Torsten Schmidt And you are… Fizzle Fizzle Fiji Kris Fiji Torsten Schmidt Those are hopefully not the names your mothers gave you? Fizzle Hmm… Not really, but they just stuck. You don’t choose your own nickname, and you never get rid of it either. Torsten Schmidt Tell me about it. Anyway, you were all born in very different parts of this country, but around the same time? Fizzle Yes, I’m all the way from the west, originally from Krefeld by the Dutch border, and I was born in ’79. Fiji Kris We should be sitting in a different order. I’m from the zonal border, from Braunschweig, and she was born all the way out east. [awhodat nods] Torsten Schmidt I’ll take that as a yes. Braunschweig... I hope you’re not into soccer. So we can skip that whole topic, and finish half an hour early. It’s only going so-so at the moment, eh? Fiji Kris I barely remember anything about Braunschweig. awhodat I found my microphone. Torsten Schmidt Oh, nice! So “all the way out east,” where would that be? awhodat Really far out, by the Czech border. Torsten Schmidt So you’re probably one of the very few people in this building who listened to things that were recorded in this exact location. awhodat Yeah, probably. Born 1981. Torsten Schmidt Did the Funkhaus have any special meaning to you? Is it like ZDF Lerchenberg, or something that you knew as a child? awhodat No, not for me. Torsten Schmidt I am asking because when I first heard the record that we just partially listened to from Trettmann’s #DIY album, which I believe you produced entirely... Fizzle Yes, the whole thing. Torsten Schmidt ... That, in a weird way, it reminded me of what Günther Fischer and Manfred Krug used to do in the Amiga studios, and then recorded it live in locations like this one right here. Fizzle In what sense? I can’t really make anything of it, but I’ve been told that a few times. I don’t know the recordings, I’ve never listened to them, so I don’t know the meaning of that. Maybe you can explain what about our music reminds you of that. Torsten Schmidt Well, people from our generation, as so often with music that is older than we are, we got to know it through hip-hop. In this case it was Eins Zwo, who sampled “Baden Gehn,” which was on one of Manfred Krug’s records. And for many of us, Manfred Krug was this strange TV lawyer, or the grumpy trucker, and then we were like, “What do you mean he also sang?” And of course these records were not available at an affordable price anywhere, but then, oddly enough, two, three would become available in record stores not far away from here. And there, in the late ’60s/early ’70s, they would record jazz with huge big-band orchestras, and this dude from the Telekom commercial would sing just like he was from the Mississippi Delta. He really had the blues in him, and he expressed it in words that were not at all embarrassing, but he still spoke about very emotional things. Fizzle Got it. His own lyrics or did he translate English things? Torsten Schmidt No, he wrote in German. And similar to Brazil at the time, he would wrap criticism about the regime in metaphors, just like on “Baden Gehn,” or like “Billie Holiday.” Fizzle Makes sense. Tretti definitely has blues in him, and he’s very gifted when it comes to writing in German, making things sound non-cheesy, and creating images and triggering emotions. He has massive talent, he can achieve all that with a great flow and without making it sound corny, and his voice is just full of blues. There’s no better way to describe it. Torsten Schmidt The first time you were confronted with his work, that was probably not clear from the start? Fizzle Quite the opposite really. He used to be Ronny Trettmann, the funny reggae Saxon that would joyfully make fun of German reggae, and things like, “Der Sommer, Sommer ist für alle da,” that’s the kinda stuff he did. So the complete opposite of that. But already then, in his previous discography, there would be single songs on his albums between 14 slapstick tracks that had you going, “OK, wow. There’s more to discover here.” For example, on his album Tanz auf dem Vulkan there’s a track called “Schwarzer Sonntag,” and on it you can hear his blues and how he tells this story. So it was always there, but he didn’t pursue it then, or the producers led him in a different direction, but we chose that particular side of him as an artist and decided that’s the one we want to work with. Torsten Schmidt You used to also play dancehall when you DJed, and he was the guy who, amongst all these summer hits, had some legit dancehall tracks. Fizzle Definitely. Within his genre, he was the boss. If you’re talking about German dancehall and looking at this particular scene only, he was by far the best and the only one, and he won all the prizes he could possibly win. But eventually he reached the limit, because reggae and dancehall are a part of a pretty small scene in Germany. Torsten Schmidt Small in a way that you guys also got to know each other through this scene? Fizzle Exactly. Torsten Schmidt So, Braunschweig… Fiji Kris Formed from the sediments of the German dancehall scene, that’s basically how KitschKrieg came to be. Torsten Schmidt But just like coffee grounds, it can be a great fertilizer. Fizzle Yeah. Torsten Schmidt Do you remember the first time you saw each other face to face? Fizzle I remember exactly the first time I met Fiji. It was at Brain Club in Braunschweig, pretty legendary place. If you DJ in Germany you’re going to end up in this club sooner or later, and he was there and was playing his own productions using self-constructed controllers, with his project at the time, Symbiz. I thought that was really insane, because normally people will DJ on turntables or CD players, but he stood there with this handcrafted box, pushing buttons and playing his own songs on it. To this day, I’ve never seen anything like it. Torsten Schmidt So Krefeld didn’t have that kind of stuff? Fizzle No. Fiji Kris Then he booked us a gig in Krefeld, one of our first trans-regional bookings. Fizzle And how did it go? [laughs] There wasn’t much going on there. Fiji Kris It was just on the rise. Fizzle I remember standing backstage and saying “OK, nobody really showed up, so I’m going to go to the ATM to withdraw your fee, because I don’t see this happening today anymore.” So that’s how we met. And awhodat, we spent a lot of time hanging out at dancehall parties in Cologne, and checked out all the German soundsystems like Pow Pow Movement, the Berliners Supersonic [Sound] and that whole era. Concrete Jungle, Barney Miller, all these people. It was the golden age of dancehall, when it was new in Germany, people were really excited about it and the parties were full, it was a good time. Torsten Schmidt Did Gerd Gummersbach still have his location then? Fizzle Yes, he did. And if you didn’t use the stand on the turntables you would die. He would literally throw things at you and go, “Use the stand!” “OK, sorry.” awhodat We bought all our mixtapes from Gerd Gummersbach. I’ve known Kris since June 3rd, 2014. Fizzle It’s always like this. Fiji Kris She’s our annalist. How long since KitschKrieg was founded? We’ll be like, “Something between 2 and 4 years,” but she’ll be able to tell you exactly how many days. Torsten Schmidt So when was KitschKrieg founded? awhodat 4th anniversary coming up soon. Torsten Schmidt Better circle the date in your calendars, or you’ll be in trouble. Fizzle Which exact day do you even go by? What’s our founding date? awhodat There are several dates. But really it’s November 1st, 2014. Fiji Kris And there you have it. OK. Torsten Schmidt And what happened on that day? awhodat I came to Berlin from Cologne with just a shoebox and a suitcase. And then the three of us lived together in a flat share. Fiji Kris Until recently. We always said, “When things start going well, we will all get our own place.” And we just did, so things are going great! Fizzle Yeah! [applause] Torsten Schmidt But aren’t you afraid that you’ll be missing something now? Fiji Kris That was everyone’s reaction! When Fizzle posted to Facebook that he was looking for a place, my brother called to ask if everything’s okay with us. But we all still live really close to each other. Fizzle We hang out every day. Our studio is there, and we have this small space that we’re fixing up at the moment, but it’s nice to go home in the eve and not to have to see them anymore. Torsten Schmidt You probably had enough time in your joint flat to figure out who does dishes, who takes out the trash, etc. How do you divide it up with whatever it is that you are? A production team, a label, or multimedia entity? Fizzle I don’t even know what an entity is. Torsten Schmidt It definitely sounds very official. Fizzle I don’t know. We stopped trying to define it. We make music, we do photography, create videos and clothes and everything else we are interested in. So in the end it’s probably just a brand that delivers content of any sort. Fiji Kris We decided we’re not going to try to be a band. You have to ask yourself how you want to take it to the stage, how much is it going to be about us as individuals. We try to emphasize our work, our brand name and our logo, and the people we work with, rather than forming a band and trying to become the center of attention. Torsten Schmidt About the logo. Are you, as a Krefeld native, responsible for the LA Kings reference? Fizzle No, that was him. [points to Fiji Kris] Against resistance from Nicole. I mean awhodat, sorry. Torsten Schmidt I was wondering since when everybody’s into the NHL? Fiji Kris It’s more of a cultural reference dedicated to gangster rap from LA, like N.W.A. and the Raiders and Kings and that kind of stuff. Torsten Schmidt OK. We just listened to Tretti, and I assume we’re all fans here, but maybe we can give a short insight into what you’ve been doing since November 1st, 2014. Fizzle Our first KitschKrieg release was an EP with Noah Slee from New Zealand. Torsten Schmidt How do you find these people? Fiji Kris Soundcloud. Fizzle Classic Soundcloud scenario. You upload your music and then you find a message in your inbox from somebody saying, “Hey, I’m coming to Berlin and I think your music is super interesting, so let’s get together.” So we met him and got to know him, and then we created the first KitschKrieg release. That was a rather slow beginning, it took a full year to finish the EP, but afterwards we moved on into the phase where we did the EPs with Tretti, which were called KitschKrieg EPs. We made three of those, KitschKrieg 1, 2, and 3. And that was Trettmann’s new beginning. Together, Trettmann and KitschKrieg then made an EP with Megaloh, the Herb & Mango EP. Then we did an EP for RAF [Camora] and Bonez [MC] as part of their Palmen aus Plastik box, a dancehall EP with RAF, Bonez and Tretti. Then we worked with Haiyti for her Toxic EP, and through working with her we got to know Joey Bargeld and released another 3 EPs with him. So we really like EPs in case you haven’t noticed. It’s a nice short format. And then we sat down and did the Trettmann #DIY album, and that’s basically it to this day. Fiji Kris You forgot the Haiyti album. Fizzle True, we also did the Haiyti album Montenegro Zero. That’s the music we’ve created in the past 4 years. We did a few singles for friends too, but we try to do entire projects, and not send out beats, trying to get them integrated into other projects. Torsten Schmidt Can we begin with “Raver,” to give people a better impression? Fizzle Yes. “Raver” is off of KitschKrieg 2 from 2016. (music: Trettmann – “Raver”) Torsten Schmidt How did Tretti’s old dancehall friends react to this? Fizzle Pretty good. No complaints, they were excited for him. To be honest, I was worried too. Often when an artist changes so significantly it ends up being embarrassing and discredits everything they’ve done up until then. Luckily that didn’t happen here. People acknowledged that it was real, and that there was nothing really to hate about it. Fiji We also really focused on what we think about it. The whole EP phase was also our time of self-discovery. We didn’t call ourselves KitschKrieg before that. That was when we said, “We’re all in this together,” and we decided to name our EPs and ourselves KitschKrieg for the sake of the team spirit. We didn’t really have anything but team spirit. We didn’t know that we could be making money with this. [laughs] Torsten Schmidt Which one of you contributed the rave competence? Fiji Tretti himself. Fizzle He’s a proper raver. Fiji He’s really the only one of us. Fizzle None of us rave on the same level as Tretti. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt Sounds like there are secret agents amongst us. Fizzle Should we listen to another rave song? I have a nice rave track. Fiji You wanna listen to another rave song? (music: Haiyti and Joey Bargeld – unknown) Nice memories. Now that we’re listening to... Good thing you’re asking. This was a really interesting phase during which we learned a lot about ourselves. For example, we’re shamelessly quoting The Streets’ “Blinded By The Lights” on this track. It’s kind of a fuzzy line between stealing and quoting, but we decided to worry less about what’s allowed, and to just do what feels right for the song. And also, as part of KitschKrieg’s identification phase, it was a time when, just like with Tretti, we had discovered a new artist and noticed a facet. There was something sad about her, which had sporadically shimmered through before, but we wanted to emphasize it in full EP lengths. We began implementing our own ideas into the work we did with these artists. This song, for example, they hadn’t slept in ages and were totally out of it. Fizzle had recorded them and sent me this a capella over some beat. It was way too loud, with the hi-hats blasting through my headphones. We remixed it, and it turned out to be the beautiful song that it is today. Torsten Schmidt It’s definitely got a Lila Wolken, commercial TV flair to it. Fiji You think? I think it’s got a pretty commercial noughties feel to it. The steps and the shameless quote are like, “Attention! Afterhour.” Fiji The rave synths and so on are pretty borderline. You think, do I really want to go there, but you also just really like it, and that was when we said it doesn’t matter, if we like it, we’re doing it. Torsten Schmidt That takes courage. Fiji It helps when Haiyti and Joey Bargeld come stumbling into the studio still completely tripping. Torsten Schmidt If you don’t know the backstory and you listen to it, you wonder how old are these people? All the Genglish [a mix of German and English] sounds a bit like some business dude is trying to talk 1994 teenie slang. Fiji May we quote that? Fizzle I liked that one too. It’s just real. That’s the state they were in. I don’t think any of us asked ourselves how it will come across in the end. It just needed to come out at that very moment and I held a microphone up while it happened. I was also surprised by how pop-like the results were, because the moment itself wasn’t pop at all. Fiji It was funny, because you did the session with them, and you were super annoyed. Bargeld is a sketchy dude, on a first impression, so you catch yourself thinking, “I hope he doesn’t steal anything.” So yeah you were pretty annoyed by it all. But I remember, there was a second song that was created during this session, and you sent it along just like, “Oh, and we have this too.” Fizzle I don’t even remember that. Fiji Do you remember? awhodat No, I don’t. But I know I was not in Berlin, and Fizzle sent it to me and I... No wait, that was a different song, it was “Hero für Fuffi,” and I realized right away we have to work with this guy. Fiji It wasn’t that obvious to us. [all laugh] But that’s how we started working in a ping-pong style. Because I wasn’t part of the session I wasn’t annoyed and I could judge it differently, from another perspective. And we do that quite a lot actually, where we don’t all work together at the same time, but rather take turns. Torsten Schmidt That’s quite an interesting approach for anyone working with beats. Fiji Yeah, the interesting thing is, beats are beats, songs are songs. Torsten Schmidt And how does A, or B, turn into S? Fiji Via A-B-C. Wow. Torsten Schmidt Algebra One? Fiji Just teamwork. Eisfeld once said, “It’s a nice beat, but good beats are just good beats. We need great songs,” and that really stuck with me. Torsten Schmidt That’s a good example, because even he and his crew had different phases, and you could always tell that they were better when they had somebody else to give another opinion. Somebody that would say, “Cool idea, but let’s try this differently.” It’s not the most comfortable position to be in, when you’re working with these frail, beaming, lighthouse-like artist personalities, and you think, “OK, you’re shining, but you could shine so much more if you did things like this.” Fizzle But that’s the exact moment when you have to be honest, and usually the artist is very thankful for that because if you don’t say it, the song will only turn out to be mediocre. And then one day, he’ll step onto the stage and he will only find out then that it’s not that great, and that’s so much more brutal than finding out in the studio already. Just say, “I think you can do better.” Honesty in the studio, while recording and during songwriting, is extremely important. I never once experienced an artist getting upset about it, no matter which artist it was. Fiji We’ve even completely blown off songs, or entire verses. Fizzle Yeah, the worst scenarios, but never once did anyone get mad, on the contrary. Fiji Because with growing success, you are surrounded by a crew that might be living off of and with you. You don’t need yes-sayers. That leads to nothing. It goes back to what you said earlier, we’re really trying to cultivate that kind of honesty and friction. It’s normal to not always agree, and that’s an advantage. Fizzle For example, two days ago we played new things to Eisfeld and he listened to it, and said “Amazing! The whole setup and how it builds up into the hook line, and then, nothing. Disappointing hook line it’s total BS. No, it’s not even crap. It’s just absolutely nothing. That’s how bad it is.” And we thought, “OK, thanks.” But there are no hurt feelings. It’s helpful. You listen to the song again and try to understand why he said that. We spent a lot of time working on that hook line and everything else, and then you get that kind of feedback. But it helped me be able to listen to the song again differently, and I understood what he meant. Torsten Schmidt How long did it take you to recover from the first punch to the stomach? Fiji It’s about the right attitude for that kind of conversation. It’s not really a punch to the stomach. Fizzle We just don’t have any ego issues anymore. That’s completely over and done with. You have to be able to tell each other when something sucks. “Hey, that’s a bad hook or a shitty photo.” We’ve done that so many times now, it didn’t feel like a punch, to answer your question. It was really just like, “OK, thanks.” Fiji I think we talked about artists’ egos in our last lecture, and I realized as we were speaking that we often focus on the bigger goals, like where we see this going in the long run, what the next small goal is, and so on. So the small disagreements lose their importance in the perspective of those bigger goals. Little things like one hook being shitty or Fizzle being right about something or not don’t matter. It’s more important to keep up the good flow. Torsten Schmidt Do you know roughly when you guys left your egos behind? Maybe the annalist? Fizzle I think after the first EP, which took a year. Because all the EPs that followed happened a lot quicker and easier, so it must have been sometime around then. If you take one year for four songs, you have to ask yourself what’s going wrong. Torsten Schmidt That doesn’t really help pay the bills. Fizzle Right. It didn’t make much sense. That’s when we realized that it’s a problem. The ego goes hand in hand with personal taste, and you can’t really fight about that. Fiji So we became pragmatic about it and divided up our responsibilities, so different people had the authority over different decisions. Whether I look my best in a specific photo is not really the issue, and it’s not my decision either. If we start fighting about that, we’re just wasting our time. Fizzle Which is what happens usually. The photo discussion is a typical issue. Try and get 3-4 people to agree on the best shot. Everybody looks at themselves, so it’s much more efficient leaving it up to somebody who knows a thing or two about photography. Fiji It’s an interesting example, because awhodat is often not in our photos, because she’s usually the one taking them. So she’s the best person to judge them, because all I look at is my own crooked nose. awhodat What we really learned is that there’s no point in getting caught up in discussions. That way, things never get done. You have to be able to look at the last 20% of it from a distance. Use an objective perspective, because these two often lose themselves in the details. They get all nerdy. But you need someone to step in and say, “It’s done. It’s nice, it touches me.” And then it’s really done. A common mistake is to add another layer, and another one, and another one without actually noticing that’s it’s actually already complete. Send it off, next. Fiji What Nicole said is a great example for the benefits of judging from an outside perspective, when you’re not yet blinded by the routine and unbiased. We are different people and have different talents. Women feel better. They are often more in tune with their emotions. awhodat What he’s trying to say is women cry a lot. Torsten Schmidt I thought he was trying to make me cry with his accusations. Fiji It wasn’t meant like that. What matters is, is it a good song? Does it deliver emotion? Or is it just a great snare and otherwise crafted to death? Torsten Schmidt Maybe this is a good moment to show what you contribute to KitschKrieg. Let’s watch the Jamaica video. (video: Trettmann and KitschKrieg – #DIY auf Jamaika) It’s always pretty brutal having to watch your own work along with other people. Fizzle Yes, but also nice. I haven’t seen it in a while, and it was nice to watch. How long has it been? awhodat February 2018. Fiji I miss the fruit lady. Fizzle It’s nice to be able to travel around the world and do our thing and then it gets captured so beautifully. Torsten Schmidt Why work in black and white? awhodat There’s a running gag that I’m color blind. Fizzle It remains unclear to this day. Torsten Schmidt So you haven’t gotten a boating license yet. awhodat I have a drivers license, so I don’t think I am color blind. I don’t know. It was just a natural development. I always had a thing for black and white, and I bought this camera... [to Fiji] No you bought it! On credit. It took us five years to pay off. Torsten Schmidt So we’re talking something like a Leica camera. No? Because it took five years to pay off. Fiji We were just that broke. awhodat Really broke. It just happened naturally. I always liked it that way. Fiji We also thought that visually it fit in with what we do audibly. A lot of reduction, a lot of black space, a lot of pauses. Less is more. awhodat Yeah. The look and feel is very similar to our music. Especially when you look at Tretti, Haiyti, Joey Bargeld. They’re not going to say something they can’t back up. It’s all real. And it’s the same with the photos. It’s not about turning someone into something they’re not. The photo can have perfect lighting and detail, but if you feel nothing, then it’s not going to work. At least not for me. And what’s also similar with our photos and our music is the pauses, the reduction. You have a photo with lots of black, smoke, and then you see Tretti, only this small, but it still gets to you emotionally. Or repetitions in the music, stylistic tools, they become reflections in the photos. A raspy voice is represented by a crack in the floor, with nice lighting. Torsten Schmidt But you don’t only use it online, but also for your live shows. It’s a pretty big part of your live shows actually. awhodat Yeah, as of recently. Fizzle Like awhodat said, it really carries a certain feel. When you look at Trettmann’s Splash! show, we had a really nice scenery, everything was dark and in the background you had these nice black and white images and moving images. That, carefully adjusted to a live setting with the appropriate lighting, which for one short moment turned colorful, but otherwise remained white the entire time, really playing with the black and white concept of the show. It all connects and it emphasizes the mood of it all. It feels like it’s always belonged together, and it kind of has, so it makes perfect sense for us. Torsten Schmidt Tretti himself also performs more monochromatically than he did in the past. Fizzle Yeah. Exactly. That was a joint decision. We’re doing all of it together. Trettmann is really more like a band, and we decided to implement that concept together, and add our own style to it. And Tretti likes it. He promoted it from the start and was happy to do something else for a change, and he was also the one who suggested calling the EPs KitschKrieg. So it all came together very naturally, and now it just belongs that way. There are also moments in which we further develop that imagery. I remember being on Böhmermann, he had invited Tretti, and they performed “Grauer Beton” with an orchestra, and they turned it into a TV thing. They took awhodat’s video for “Grauer Beton” and adopted the black and white theme. It was amazing. Beautiful. Torsten Schmidt I think we’re going to get to that in a second. Like in any great cooking show, we’ve prepared something. But I find this very interesting. Were you already on board for “Großvater?” Fizzle No, not in this constellation. We were there in a way that we would occasionally produce something for him with our previous projects or made a remix. Since the first Trettmann songs, there’s always been a remix by us for every song. Torsten Schmidt Looking back on it, it was a moment where people realized, “Hang on, there’s more to this guy, and he wants to talk about other things too. Do more than songs like ‘Applaus.’” Although that was a very entertaining metaphor. Fizzle Totally. Torsten Schmidt But that video was also black and white. Fizzle It was, but that was more of a coincidence. That was his second or third song, and he would go back and forth between different styles. So that was just a coincedence, not our influence. Torsten Schmidt You we’re just talking about Böhmermann and “Grauer Beton.” Four weeks ago the topic came full circle when Tretti, who is from Karl-Marx-Stadt, performed at the concert. You were so kind to prepare some pieces from that. Let’s watch half of that video, just to get back in. (video: Trettmann feat. RTO Ehrenfeld – “Grauer Beton (live)”) I call this an all-round success. Since Spliff’s “Glaspalast,” which was something like 35 years ago, I don’t think we’ve had something so contemporary that really gets to people, is personal and still done in a way that even a 13 year old can relate. Fizzle Thanks. Fiji We also had the feeling it was something special, because it’s a part of German history that doesn’t really get talked about much in pop music in such a straightforward way. Torsten Schmidt There was this Paul van Dyk piece that left you feeling weird, but this track is, as he says himself, just to let people know where he’s from. And the chorus, how many months before the parliamentary elections was this track released? Three or four months or so? awhodat It was released on August 22nd. [applause] Yeah I know that, because we finished it up the night before, on August 21st at 10 PM, and the night before that, a hotel room window fell onto my leg in Hamburg. True story. But I called them in Berlin and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll still have the video ready in time. We can upload it at midnight.” [laughs] Torsten Schmidt Another part of it are the figures of speech, but also repetitions like the ones young listeners are used to from artists like Yung Thug and other Atlanta rappers. But the lines about “Seelenfänger” [soul hunters] are no accusations. Fizzle Right, he’s just describing what he saw. He literally saw that, he lived there, and he’s just sharing images of what he saw, and we supported him and told him to go with it. I personally didn’t know the story, because I come from the west, and it was unfathomable for me, but with the way he described these images, it became possible for me to envision them too. And when we drove out there to shoot the video, it all came together nicely. We were able to understand what it was like back in the day, and also what the vibe is like nowadays. It all got captured very well. Fiji That song was also a special track on the album, it underlines our transition from doing EPs to doing albums, because we worked much more conceptually and we had these songs ready before we had the music. I remember you saying, “Hey, we have ‘Grauer Beton,’ it’s about this topic, and now we need music that can carry that message, and also fits to the rest of the album, but not anything turn-up style or too zeitgeisty.” And how does one do that? With a TR-808 cowbell. Do you know the TR-808? It’s a drum machine from the ’80s. I just secretly Wikipedia-ed it again. It’s a Japanese drum machine from 1980 from the brand Roland, and Tretti loved the cowbell sound. It was like an insider gag, and so it’s pretty funny that the cowbell ended up being such a substantial element to the song. The Zeit magazine falsely called it a Gameboy sound one time. I would like to set that record straight right now. Fizzle I want to add one thing. You said young people know this stuff from Yung Thug and so on, and that’s exactly what it is in its simplest form. Of course it went through several stages lyrically, but it was written to a Mike Will Made-It beat. So it’s definitely related. Torsten Schmidt Which one? Fizzle I don’t know. Some random Mike Will Made-It beat. And that’s another example of what writing can be like. Somebody’s digging a beat, and then you write a song to it, and then you have lyrics, and then you take another look at it without the beat, and then eventually the music just wraps itself around it, and that’s basically how “Grauer Beton” came to be. Torsten Schmidt Before we get into detail about the rug that was woven around these lyrics, when do you hold yourselves back? There are some very personal songs on this album, about breakups and one about suicide, and sometimes it seems that with the lyrics being so detailed, some parts are unusually sloppy for him. You get the feeling that it’s so close and personal already that you don’t want to push him over the edge by trying to dig even deeper, and working on it even longer, because everything could fall apart then. Fizzle That’s exactly it. The suicide scenario is also based on a true experience he made, and turning it into a song was already a tough decision to make. Working on the track was difficult, the days after were difficult. Everything about it felt as heavy as the song itself. And then it’s not about singing it again and trying to get it perfectly. It’s allowed to be a bit sloppy, as long as the emotions are real, and they are. So it’s about understanding that there are more important things than recording take after take. Fiji It was like fate, because it happened towards the end of the album’s production, and we didn’t make any more songs than the ones that ended up on the album, so we had nine songs and the tenth one was missing, and then that happened. Tretti was completely out of it, and we thought “Oh god, how are we going to finish up this album? And how is he going to deal with this?” Writing a song about it almost seemed like our only option. It was tough. We all sat in our kitchen with a lump in our throat. Torsten Schmidt The thing is, even when you play it to adults, like, “Here, this is what your kids listen to,” especially compared to RAF Camora, they notice – and you were just talking about the blues – that the really meaningful parts are not thoroughly designed and perfected, and that’s exactly what helps make it so authentic and honest. Fizzle That’s exactly the trick. You keep the mistakes and don’t try to make it Hollywood style, and record five voices and turn them into one, until it’s so smooth and perfect, that you can’t differentiate one voice from another anymore. We don’t have much doubling, barely any ad libs, one well-recorded track, conveying all the emotions, has to be enough. It was back in the day. When you listen to old records, that can be enough. When somebody has an important message, the song is simply good, and the feeling is real. Most of the time when you try to make more of it, it’s really you trying to hide the fact that it wasn’t enough to begin with. You have to be honest with yourself and understand that you can’t sugarcoat it, because that doesn’t make it any better. Torsten Schmidt Reverb is not the answer to all our questions. Fizzle No. Torsten Schmidt Something you probably learned from dub and dancehall is the courage to add pauses, in your videos often shown as black slides. You often include breaks in pace, and you allow echoes to unfold. Why don’t you show us the different components of the song? Fiji We’ll start with the cowbell. [plays cowbell on computer] This is the infamous 808 cowbell. Initially I listened to it and discovered that it’s really a dyad. I’m not super familiar with music theory, but it’s a quint, meaning there are 5 halftones between it. So I did this with it, to emphasize that. [plays section of the backing track] It’s a sound that consists of two notes. Then I added the sound to a sampler and pitched it down. [plays backing track] One octave lower, and another octave lower. And that’s what stayed until the end, because I love the transition between the original sound and how it then develops into the foundation of what becomes the beat. Torsten Schmidt The great thing about an 808 is that, for the past 37 years, it’s had a great meaning to basically every music genre, but it’s a super rare machine. People think everything’s been done with it already. Fiji The great thing is the sounds are so modifiable. You can do so much by changing pitch and duration, and therefore super versatile in their application, but they also remain recognizable throughout, just like the cowbell. They’re charged with associations, like the ’80s and Gameboy sounds, which gives modern beats a retro touch, because something is only retro if it reminds you of something. Torsten Schmidt When the machine first entered the market it was a total flop, and then it was rediscovered by some broke people, because they could buy it for a few bucks in second-hand shops. Fiji Exactly. And nowadays nobody has the machine, but everybody has the sample set. Torsten Schmidt Right. Back in the day if you wanted to tune this machine, you’d have to completely take it apart, solder the parts and build in a putty, remove cables. I’m going to assume that 90% of the people, not just the ones in Atlanta, that have worked with these sounds, have never actually seen one of these machines. Fiji I saw one once, but I never owned one. And then I... Torsten Schmidt Before we get there. You’re playing everything from your computer. It doesn’t look like you are a total tech equipment crack. Fiji This is the studio. [points to laptop] Fizzle And this is the second studio. [points to other laptop] And then we have one more for photos and videos, and that’s our setup. That’s really all you need nowadays. Torsten Schmidt Very duster friendly. Fizzle If you’re being honest with yourself, consider how much these machines can do. If you have ideas, this is all you need. Here for example, Logic is running, and here’s a a mini jack, and that’s how we produced the Tretti album, even without a sound card. Torsten Schmidt None of these 96kHz... Fizzle Vocals is a bit of a different story, but that’s really the only thing that requires proper equipment, like a good mic, a good compressor and good studio monitors for listening purposes, and that’s the entire setup. Our studio is very minimalistic, there’s not a lot of stuff standing around. Fiji And we did everything with this laptop, even the final mixing. And then I layered the cowbells with the keyboard [plays backing track]. And it becomes a melody, because there’s two notes coming together. You almost already have a chord sequence, so all you need to do is add a third note, and then you automatically have a minor chord [plays backing track]. I was really happy with how it turned out, because the cowbell chords basically ended up dictating the rest, and it kind of just unfolded on its own. Next we had to decide on a snare. We chose the same cowbell, adding reverb this time [plays backing track]. And then... [plays backing track] there’s basically just another bass layer, also done with the 808, and a piano on top of it, and that’s it. We decided not to add any hi-hats or a louder snare, because we wanted everything on the frequency of his voice to remain free, to achieve maximum emphasis on him. Torsten Schmidt You just said “charged.” How much, especially with a German topic like this, how much do you worry about slipping into a sentimentality, that makes it difficult? Or is that not an issue for you? Fizzle I think they were independent factors. He wanted the cowbells, because every beat involving cowbells is a good beat in Tretti’s opinion, so we took a closer look at that. I remember coming to the studio and he [points to Fiji] showed it to me in a similar way as just now, showing the individual steps and taking it apart again, and it wasn’t in connection to a specific topic or a song. The music was completely detached from what it turned into later. Torsten Schmidt Then how did the two parts come together and mold so perfectly? Fizzle That is the earlier described allocation of different responsibilities. This is how you can imagine it. We have this pool, which is our Dropbox, and it has a text document in it with the lyrics to “Grauer Beton,” so we all know there’s a song, there might even be a demo of it somewhere, or Tretti might have sung it to you on the phone before. And then it happens... Not always, but sometimes... That everything comes together neatly. That was the moment in the studio, when I was presented the beat and Tretti had just sung it to me two days earlier, and I thought, “OK, I think we have lyrics for that.” Fiji I also think that just the piano makes it a very cheesy ballad, very over the top, and producing is always about micro decisions, what do we need more of? What do we need less of? Finding that balance between 808, which is street and hip-hop, and putting it together with the piano in a way that you get away with it, that’s the trick. Torsten Schmidt Are you fighting a war against kitsch, or are you using kitsch as a tool to fight? Fizzle We’re against it. It’s our enemy. Torsten Schmidt There’s no clear line you can follow though. Fizzle Once you find your own style and learn to trust it, it becomes easy. You really only have to listen to your inner voice and base your decisions on that. It’s a very easy thing, you just have to have confidence and trust yourself. Torsten Schmidt Dancehall is also a good basis for that, because here you also have the great big feelings. Fizzle Sure, but I don’t know if that’s just the case with dancehall. If you listen to soul or any of the various sub-genres, there’s always going to be songs that are just too much and then one that strikes a chord with you. I think that applies to all genres, and everyone has to define those limits for themselves, because it’s different for everyone. Luckily we all have a similar threshold for when things become too embarrassing and that’s a major advantage for us. Fiji Remember when we recorded the vocals? That was also special, because his voice was so rugged, which contributed to the realness of it all and makes it so much less cheesy, but originally he was against us using that recording. awhodat I think “Grauer Beton” is a really great example for, I don’t want to say magic, but sometimes there are things in the process of a production that you can label, one guy is working the cowbells like a pro and everybody just plays their part. But if you pick it apart, you see there were the lyrics for one, Fizzle created some images that were fitting, Kris made the beat. I read the lyrics first, and only heard the beat when the first demo was ready. For me, because it’s also my story in a way, I kept asking myself, “How do we solve this? What kind of a beat is this? How does it all go together?” And it fits perfectly. It just became clear that we’re going to add his broken voice, even though it’s not perfect, and Tretti would have preferred recording new vocals. And then we were faced with the challenge of having to create a video for that, about a topic that’s... Ugh. But everything came together really perfectly in the end. Fiji The recording is also the first demo. He had just returned from his tour and was totally hoarse. I’ll play it for you quickly. (music: Trettmann – “Grauer Beton”) Fizzle This is a great example for vocals that aren’t perfect, but full of emotions. And it makes you realize how invaluable it is when an artist trusts you, because you can convince them that this is exactly how it needs to be for this track, and talk them out of trying to do it again properly after a good night’s rest, because I’m convinced that would have ruined it. Fiji That brings us back to the metaphor from earlier, where you may not like the way you look in a photograph, but we on the outside can see that it’s still the better shot from an unbiased point of view. awhodat And Tretti trusts us, and goes along with it all, just like it happened with the video. I had a vision of it. I planned it. And I tried to convey what we had planned for that day, and only once the video was done Fizzle said, “Ah, now I get it!” Both these guys and Tretti trusted me completely. They just told me to do my thing, and that was that. Fizzle It’s important for teams to let the other people do their own thing, because often you only understand their vision when it’s done. You have your own understanding of their idea, and what you imagine may be shit, but then it goes down a whole other alley and in the end you like it after all. That’s why you just gotta let people do their own thing sometimes. Fiji I think you just summed up KitschKrieg perfectly. Do your thing. Done. Torsten Schmidt Does that mean a decision like changing the lyrics, or switching octaves, was there all along? Fizzle That’s usually part of the recording process. We make those micro decisions while we record and say, “Go higher a bit, do less of that.” During the entire time we recorded this album, there isn’t one single recording that took several attempts to complete. We worked on one song at a time, made all the decisions right then and there, and then it would stay that way. Pretty intense. Fiji If anything, we brainstormed first what kind of songs might still be missing on the album, that’s what I meant earlier about transitioning from EPs, which were about the moment and our crew, to albums, saying “We want ten songs, what’s still missing on the spectrum in terms of music and also lyrics?” Torsten Schmidt When you use a take that’s not perfect, but perfectly captures a moment, and you want to work it into a live set, performing it 30 nights in a row, and audiences have high expectations, how do you go about that? What needs to be adapted or presented differently live? Fizzle The songs are quite simple and without any crazy stunts or vocals edits. We got one great standalone track, carrying all the emotions, therefore I think it’s quite easy for someone like Tretti to perform them live too, because there are no artificial heights. It’s all on his spectrum and our music leaves enough room for his voice to unfold, all of that makes it easy for him to sing to. Torsten Schmidt Were you also in Chemnitz the other week? Fizzle No, we were not in Germany. We kept track of the events on the internet and of course also had a personal exchange about him going there and what he’ll be doing there. It’s a very important issue for him, because this is his home town, and it’s a topic that’s accompanied him his whole life already. We weren’t there, but we watched it online. Torsten Schmidt Oddly enough, the online stream of his performance doesn’t show this one song, it begins right after his performance of “Grauer Beton.” Fizzle Oh, great. Torsten Schmidt Yeah, really well done. Before we get to questions from the audience, let’s talk about one, two other artists you’ve worked with. Mr. Bargeld, for example, would turn 16 bars from Tretti into an entire album as far as lyrics go, huh? Fizzle Totally. You could argue that’s complete bullshit, or you can accept the fact that it can deliver just as much emotion as someone rapping three times 16 bars plus a hook and a bridge. We believe Bargeld’s music is enough. I don’t feel like there’s anything missing in terms of lyrics or feeling. It’s all there. Should I show you a Bargeld track with lots of lyrics? Torsten Schmidt And a lot of feeling. Bargeld feeling. (music: Joey Bargeld – unknown) That’s more of a Kanye West approach. Fizzle Yeah, maybe. You have to be ballsy to do that, but once you get into it, you don’t feel like anything’s missing. I’m happy with the outcome. Fiji We definitely had this discussion internally. Fizzle Yeah, what the hell. One day at the studio and this is what you got? Fiji You get sent this vocal track... Although this is one of the more productive outpourings by Mr. Bargeld. Fizzle Yeah, we have a song “Party Leben.” “Party, Party, Party, Leben.” Two words. Fiji And I even had to loop those. [laughter] And then the reply to that is, “But listen to how intense this one word...” And in the end you ask yourself, is this art or can it be tossed? There is a level on which you can sit down with an artist for hours, just to maybe end up with three words or one sentence or one hook. You need a lot of patience for that, and I don’t have that. Fizzle A track like “Party Leben” stems from an eight/nine-hour recording day. We have tons of vocals, it’s not like that’s all we ended up with, but for some reason that ended up being the thing we thought we should work with. Fiji It’s about reduction. I always go on about how it’s the same for beats and photos, but it really is. Digitally, we have access to any sound in the world, we could add woodwinds or anything we want, but we’re limited by what KitschKrieg defines itself as. What is the band? What’s the orchestra? What vocabulary do we want to use? And then it always ends up being the same five sounds, or always the same 16:9 black and white look. Torsten Schmidt More cowbell. What do nine hours of working with Megaloh look like, versus nine hours with Mr. Bargeld? Fizzle That’s the complete opposite to Joey Bargeld. He has every syllable rhyming with the next one, so even we lose track of it, the raps and rhymes are fragmented into such tiny details that it becomes a whole other discipline and then the 16 bars need to be built around it accordingly. The funny thing is that Megaloh and Joey Bargeld get along really well, because they totally get that they are so far apart musically. And then you have someone like Megaloh asking Bargeld how he writes his lyrics, it’s really very funny to watch him explain that. “Uh, dunno, I just have these 3 uh... And yeah, that’s it!” [laughter] “OK cool, thanks!” Torsten Schmidt Does that mean he just shuts down after half a beat or what? Fizzle Bargeld? No. He just has a talent to distill it so much, that whatever he ends up with is still enough to make it work. For example, when we go to the studio and turn on some music and tell him to sit down and write something to that, he actually does. And then when he’s done, he has to laugh about it himself. And then he presents us one single sentence. And like I said, I think that’s a crazy talent, to reduce it to such little material, and still get away with it. It might be the hardest thing to do really. Torsten Schmidt So he’s the Johnny Lydon of German rap. Fizzle Probably, yes. Torsten Schmidt OK, so you got punk. What’s Megaloh? A sprinter? A decathlete? Fizzle He’s just THE rapper. If you do rap in that genre, you have to do it like he does. He’s a true MC in a classical sense. You don’t have to compare it, those are just two different sports. And it can happen to be similar music, but they remain two different sports. Fiji For the project Herb & Mango with him and Trettmann, we had to find a musical platform that makes all that audible. We were able to level their two voices up against each other, and I remember cutting the verses from 16 bars to 12, so it became less about length and doing it just for the purpose of sporting, and more about the awesomeness of the song. Torsten Schmidt Hang on, you cut 1/4 of a writer’s content and took it away from them? Fizzle Sure, that’s exactly our job. It may sound funny, but that’s what it comes down to. You can’t just press record and take what you get. Your job is to cut things out, to tell them to do things differently, that’s what producing is all about. It’s our job. Torsten Schmidt That sounds like we should give this a quick listen. You guys can already think about your questions and we’ll send someone around with a mic. But first, we’re going to listen to? Fizzle “Anorak” by Megaloh, Trettmann and us. (music: Megaloh, Trettmann, KitschKrieg – “Anorak”) Torsten Schmidt Alright, let’s get down to business now. How important is it for an artist’s survival, also in times of Spotify and so on, that your pieces are also suitable for gym playlists? Fizzle [laughs] Gym playlists, OK. Sure, you could think it’s important, because we only earn money from streaming and things like that, at least in our case, because we don’t go on tour, we don’t perform live, so it’s about how much music we sell or stream. You could focus on being placed in these playlists, and in order to do that it’s probably easiest to just stick to the sound people are used to. All 20 of those songs pretty much sound the same. Same pattern, same construct. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing, but it’s all the same type of music. You can play along, or what worked in our case, was to produce the complete opposite of that and attract attention that way. That also gets you into playlists. And if you make music that reaches the people emotionally, they add it to their own playlists too. You don’t want to just get into the editorial playlists, if your listeners send it to all their friends and they add it to their playlists too, then that also gets you plays and the money you need to get by. Torsten Schmidt That sounded like you have a secret agenda. It’s been a while since we last heard something new from you guys. Fizzle Suspicious. Torsten Schmidt Suspicious indeed. Fiji Would you like to name a date? Torsten Schmidt Somebody else is responsible for dates. awhodat Yeah… Fizzle Silence. Torsten Schmidt So maybe there are secrets to be uncovered soon. Does somebody have the mic and a question? A hand signal. Great. Audience Member Hi. First of all I wanted to say, 808 ftw, keep it up. Then I wanted to ask all three of you, I don’t know how you see this, but we as people want to be liked and loved. There are two groups of people for whom that’s not very productive. The first one being villains in wrestling, and the second group being artists that play the role of outsiders. And now you guys are rightfully receiving lots of love for your art and from lots of people sitting here, myself included, how does becoming less of an outsider and gaining appreciation for what you do have an influence on you? Fizzle That’s a good point. There’s that phenomenon where you lose all drive as soon as your struggle ends, and things become boring, but I don’t think we’re very susceptible to that because this is what we’ve always done. There’s no other way. We did it for ten, 15 years without any success, struggling to be able to pay our rent, over such a long amount of time, and that shows that we were never able to do it any other way. And now we’re in a phase where everything becomes possible, and we can work with all our heroes, and we’re enjoying it, but also staying true to ourselves. Our taste hasn’t changed, and I think we’re pretty unsusceptible to that because we were already of a certain age when our success kicked in. Maybe had this happened at 20 or 25 it might have been different, but now we’re just thankful to be able to go into the studio and work with people that we’re fans of, and being able to make music with them, so I think we’re pretty safe. Fiji A symptom of that, and something that should calm you down, is that when we receive awards for what we do, we usually feel really awkward about it, we just want to get back to the studio and be amongst ourselves again. Fizzle We’re really doing it for the love of it all. It’s fun creating music, and photos and videos, that’s why we do it. Audience Member Are there any other artists you’d like to work with, be it a German rapper or international artists, and do you approach them, or do you wait to be approached by them? Fizzle We typically approach these people directly. Of course we also have people approaching us, and we check them out to see if we want to work with them or not, but we’re definitely working our way down our wishlist at the moment, every chance we get. Fiji That’s true. Here’s a secret. We were joking about how our to-do list is the same as our wishlist. Torsten Schmidt Any other questions? I saw something in the back... Audience Member Does everything have to involve all KitschKrieg members, or does she also go off and shoot videos for projects you guys are not interested in? Fizzle It has to be all of KitschKrieg all the time. We tried it differently once, and it didn’t make us happy. awhodat I can take your picture without their approval. [laughter] Torsten Schmidt I guess now the time has come for us to applaud and thank these people, and let them know that we’re excited for what is to come. We started off with “Billie Holiday,” so maybe we can end this session with that video. Thank you, KitschKrieg. [applause] (video: Trettmann – “Billie Holiday”)

Kevin Saunderson
If Detroit techno had a Mount Rushmore, Kevin Saunderson’s face would be carved in granite alongside the other members of the “Belleville Three,” Juan Atkins and Derrick May. While Atkins and May are known as the originator and innovator of Detroit techno, respectively, Saunderson is often called the elevator for his role in bringing it to the mainstream. In the late ’80s, his group Inner City, which he formed with vocalist Paris Grey, topped UK charts with singles like “Big Fun” and “Good Life.” A stark departure from the more industrial work of Atkins and May, the pop-minded songs from Inner City’s platinum-selling Paradise (titled Big Fun in the US) and subsequent albums soundtracked clubs and raves around the world, and inspired countless imitations. In his 30-plus years as a solo artist, Saunderson has recorded hard-hitting techno under several aliases, including Reese, Tronik House and E-Dancer, releasing many on his record label KMS, which has also released work from artists like R-Tyme, Blake Baxter and Chez Damier. Of late, Saunderson has passed on his love of electronic music to his children Dantiez and DaMarii, both of whom have become producers and DJs.
In his lecture at the Red Bull Music Academy 2018 Berlin, Saunderson explored the history of Detroit techno, from his early musical experiments alongside Atkins and May to mainstream success with Inner City and creating the first ever dance remix.
Hosted by Christine Kakaire Welcome everybody, to what is the final lecture of term one, of RBMA 20, 2018, here in Berlin, and our final guest lecturer is sitting to my left here. There are very few people in the world who can claim to have had a hand in inventing techno but he’s definitely one of them. Please welcome, Kevin Saunderson. [applause] Kevin Saunderson
Thank you. Christine Kakaire
So as I was trying to figure out where to start with taking an overview of your entire discography, all of your projects, all of your aliases, it gave me an opportunity to really examine everything that you’ve done and the word that kind of kept coming back to me was inspiration. Inspiration in the sense of a process of intaking information, absorbing it, digesting it, having that be the catalyst to create other things and having those things go on to influence other people. So probably going to spend quite a bit of time talking about Detroit and also the year 1988 because I think that was an incredibly monumental year for you, musically and professionally. But before we get there we should go there. So I want us to start the beginning and the reason that we were playing those two tracks at the beginning by Stephanie Mills, is because they relate to your upbringing and also to your place of birth. I’d love for you to start by telling everyone where you were born and where you grew up. Kevin Saunderson
All right, so, originally born in Brooklyn, New York. I grew up there probably until I was ten, 11, 12 right around there, ten, 11. I’m from New York originally, my mother’s from Detroit, and she moved to New York and I was born there. Christine Kakaire
What was it that took you to Belleville? Because when you left New York you didn’t move to Detroit proper, you moved to Belleville which was kind of a satellite city of Detroit? What were the circumstances? Kevin Saunderson
Yeah Belleville was a suburb of Detroit, it was about maybe 30 minutes away from Downtown. Actually I moved to Inkster first. Inkster was the same, but a different type of environment than Belleville. It was kind of an urban community, poor neighborhoods and that’s where my mother grew up, so I lived there and I think I went to elementary for one year or something like that. And then I moved to Belleville which was quite different than Inkster and it was quite different than definitely Brooklyn. My mother got me out of Brooklyn because I was just around a lot of negative energy and I think she was, and she wanted to make better for me, she wanted me in a different environment so she decided to leave, vacate New York. And she moved me back where she was from. Christine Kakaire
I understand that it was something of a rude awakening for you in Belleville. It wasn’t a particularity diverse community. I believe I read in an interview that you did that it was kind of the first time you became aware of what racism was. Kevin Saunderson
Yeah, definitely, definitely. When I moved to Belleville, I moved into a nice, I guess middle class neighborhood around lakes and stuff like that and it might have been three or four black families that lived in that whole kind of... They called it a subdivision. So it’s might be, I don’t know, 150 houses, whatever. I used to always wake up, I’m doing whatever, I look outside and I see all this trash in my yard. I’m like, “Well, how’d that get there?” But it was continuously. So one day, I was outside and I heard... You see cars go by, whatever, and these cars go by and they say... they blurt out this words like, “N---a, n---a, n---a.” And I’m like... I don’t really know. I didn’t know at that time what racism was, I didn’t know what the word meant. But I watched this movies called Roots and that’s when I got my first education about slavery, and then about racism, and then I put two and two together and I could tell that these people didn’t want me in this neighborhood. When I first moved into Belleville, the first whatever, first month, two months, that’s what I got when I first moved there. Christine Kakaire
And I believe that you were quite natural when it came to sports, various sports in school. Was that kind of a bit of a refuge for you perhaps? For this environment or... Kevin Saunderson
Well Belleville was a different type of city compared to New York. It was like seriously country, very green, I didn’t have any friends. Yeah I think when I first moved there I’m like... Even school hadn’t started for maybe a couple of months at the beginning of the summer. I didn’t know Derrick [May] or Juan [Atkins] at that time either, I just didn’t know nobody. You got lakes, you could fish, and there’s not much you can really do. And I sure wasn’t making music at that point. So once I got to school, finally went to school, start going to class every day and all that, I became interested in sports because I was bored in my surroundings and I needed, or I wanted, to do something that was interesting to me. So that became my thing, and meeting Derrick, I met Derrick through sports, I met him in junior high. We were 13, 12 or 13, and that’s how I first met Derrick May. Christine Kakaire
But you didn’t get off to the best start with Derrick May, is that right? Kevin Saunderson
Well, in the beginning it was okay but maybe about a month or two later... You know how you become friends with somebody, you meet them you think, “OK, I’ll hang out with this guy.” About a month or two later, we made a bet, we bet on a football game and he lost [laughter] but he didn’t want to pay. It was whatever, $5. And he was acting silly, “I’m not going to pay.” So I got mad and I got aggressive and I had to punch him a few times, basically I beat him up, OK? That’s how we actually really became friends. [laughter] For real, because sometimes it takes that for somebody to respect you, and then all of a sudden he had that respect. I wasn’t a guy to try to bully people, I was big now but I was a nice guy, I like to get along with everybody. So we became friends from that point. Christine Kakaire
I think this is probably a good point to look at photo number one. It’s going to come up on the screen behind you. Talk us through who’s in this picture, obviously that’s you on the left there. Kevin Saunderson
That was the promotion of the compilation, I think... I want to say The Face magazine, or some magazine from England came to Detroit, and they wanted to take pictures. This was the beginning of the whole interest in our music. That was probably one of my first pictures taken. Christine Kakaire
This is the three people who... Kevin Saunderson
Obviously Derrick, and then Juan is over there and that’s the beginning almost. Christine Kakaire
And my understanding is that Juan is a few years older than you and Derrick. Kevin Saunderson
Yeah, Juan was... Let me think here. Juan is definitely two or three years older. Yeah, definitely. Christine Kakaire
I understand that Juan was the first person to start experimenting with making music... Kevin Saunderson
No doubt. Christine Kakaire
... In the very, very early ‘80s. When did you first get a sense that he was kind of tinkering with these machines and tinkering with sound? Kevin Saunderson
OK so, as I was explaining about Derrick, junior high school, we became friends, we were playing football. Juan’s brother, Aaron Atkins, also was paying sports with us. So we hung out together, because we played sports together and we kind of hung around each other. So I would go over to Juan’s house and Aaron’s house because he invited me, he invited Derrick. So we kind of hung out over there and that’s where I first met Juan. And Juan was like this kind of... In school you seen him, but he’s older, he ain’t got time to be hanging out with us. He was just older, different at that time. Thinking about different things, thinking about moving on, and high school, thinking about chicks, whatever, stuff like that. We’re just sports geeks. So going over to the house, that’s where I met Juan. And Juan, he stayed distant, he didn’t even say hi. It was like, “That’s my brother, Juan.” That was it. I seen different pieces of gear, or tape decks back then like eight-tracks and cassettes stacked on top of each other. So he was already doing something different with these machines than I was used to seeing them. You know them, the regular set, eight-track and maybe a receiver and a turntable or something like that. So he had multiple units doing whatever, I didn’t pay attention that much but that’s when I first caught this taste of... He was doing something different. That was kind of the beginning of that part but it evolved over time and over years of just being around the house and Derrick. But it really grabbed me, more or less, when Juan started making music. Derrick actually moved into my house when we were in high school, so we’re talking like three years later, we’re in high school now. Derrick moves in with me for like four months, his mother decides she’s going to move back to Detroit but she wants Derrick to finish out the school year at the same school. She didn’t want to take him out of school right then, so she asked my mother, he moves in with me and that’s when the musical part started to... That was really the beginning, I would think, of the connection with music and even my roots in New York. Because even though I was young, I used to go back to New York to visit my brothers, other relatives and listen to the radio, WBLS and all that. So we had a connection musically, we started talking about different acts, and Juan was at the beginning of making music and Derrick was trying to explain this to me. Derrick was his biggest fan and kind of prodigy at that point. Christine Kakaire
So you mentioned that you were still traveling back to New York periodically and I believe towards the end of your high school years when you were visiting New York, you were going to one particular club. Which club was that? Kevin Saunderson
Yeah, I definitely went to the Paradise Garage at least, three, four, five times and it was towards the latter part of my high school year before I went to college. I got to experience Larry Levan and Paradise Garage for sure, quite amazing experience. Not knowing at this time too that I was going to be making records, and making a record that actually Larry could play. But I was so inspired by the atmosphere, the sound, just the music, the feeling I got when I went there. I got there, whatever, 1 AM in the morning, I left at 12 PM so, definitely... Christine Kakaire
The first track as people were walking in was by Stephanie Mills called “What Cha' Gonna Do with My Lovin',” which is a song that you ended up covering with your project, Inner City, in the late ’80s. But we’ll kind of talk about that a little bit more a little bit later. Going back to Detroit around this period while Juan is experimenting, you and Derrick are communicating, in the same space, talking about music. And I believe at this point for all of you, the Electrifying Mojo played a huge influence as well. It’d be great ff you could to the participants who he was or who he is, rather. Kevin Saunderson
So when Derrick moved in with me, probably the first night... It’s, I don’t know, 11:30 PM, whatever. I’m like, “I’m going to sleep.” He’s like, “You’re going to sleep? No man, it’s time for the Electrifying Mojo.” That’s what he told me. I hadn't heard of Mojo. [laughter] I had no clue who Mojo was at this time, so I was like, “OK.” He cuts the radio on and that was my first experience, so Derrick introduced me to the Electrifying Mojo to listening to the Midnight Funk Association, that’s what he called it. That’s how my influences that came... Really was from New York and then I’m round my mother so I’m listening to Motown stuff too, because that’s what she grew up on. But I listen to a lot of New York stuff when I can, so... But that’s when my musical taste, it got broader, I started hearing different music. The way he introduced music, the way he played music, Mojo would play albums when you're used to hearing maybe one song or maybe another single. When Mojo played, he had this theme with Star Wars and all that kind of stuff and it led up to this great intro that lead into whatever he was pushing that night, whether it was Prince, Parliament-Funkadelic, Kraftwerk , The B-52s, all that stuff got introduced to me through that channel, through knowing Derrick. And that’s how I started finding out about Mojo. That became a ritual, I wouldn’t miss his show. Christine Kakaire
Yeah I mean it was every night, right? Kevin Saunderson
I can’t remember that part but... I can’t remember, was it every night? Was it every night, Mike? [asks Mike Banks in the audience] John? OK. Yeah, it was every night. So, wow. Just some great music and some great times. Christine Kakaire
I’d actually love to play just a little rip that I found of Electrifying Mojo’s very cinematic, very over the top radio intro. I think just to give people a sense of the world he was building and also the community that he was building with the Midnight Funk Association. So I’m just going to play around a minute or so of this intro. (music: The Electrifying Mojo – “Midnight Funk Association intro”) That’s just a fraction of that particular intro. Could we look at photo number eight on the screen actually? So this Midnight Funk Association was an actual card-carrying membership. Were you a member? Kevin Saunderson
I was a member just because I was listening and I was just into it, that’s all that mattered to me. I don’t even know if I knew about the cards. Christine Kakaire
I found this one deep in the internet. But I think something that I love about this Midnight Funk Association community is that idea of people signaling to each other, like switching on the porch lights or even honking their horns at midnight... Kevin Saunderson
Honking horns, flashing lights, definitely. Christine Kakaire
... And creating this sense of community and people being connected through the music. Mojo, was he somebody that you talk about at school? You talk about the tracks that you heard, etc? Kevin Saunderson
Yeah, definitely. We’d definitely talk about the tracks, especially if you heard a new album of a new Parliament-Funkadelic that you hadn’t heard. Just amazing. And you heard music that was completely different, like I said, B-52s and all that kind of stuff. It was just so way out from what standard radio was playing and you didn’t want to hear any other radio besides something like Mojo. Christine Kakaire
Did you ever meet him in person? Kevin Saunderson
Definitely, of course I met Mojo. As time went on, Mojo did his segments just featuring Inner City and I was like, “Wow, this is like... This can’t be real.” So definitely, yup. Christine Kakaire
Before we get to Inner City, I want to try doing something and creating something of an audio family tree. Because around ’86, ’87 I believe, is when you started observing and watching and eventually joining in. Making music with Juan and Derrick but also other characters like James Pennington, Santonio Echols, etc etc. And I think it's really interesting to hear various kinds of hallmarks and sound signatures already starting to emerge at that point. So what we’re going to do is just listen to quite short, 30 to 45 second grabs of particular tracks. The first three are Juan and Derrick, I’ll let you know what those are. And then the second lot of three are tracks that you, Kevin, were involved in, and I feel like you can already hear the eventual traces of Inner City starting to kind of assemble. OK, so the first track we’re going to listen to is Juan’s very famous debut, under the name of Cybotron. (music: Cybotron – "Clear") That was Clear by Cybotron AKA Juan Atkins, from 1983, which is kind of hard to believe. So just a couple of years later Juan and Derrick released a record under the name X-Ray and I’m going to play a track called Let’s Go. And I believe, when I was kind of doing research about this, that you were observing them. It took them a few months to make this track, do you have any particular memories about this track? Kevin Saunderson
Are speaking to X-Ray or Clear? Or both? Christine Kakaire
X-Ray. Kevin Saunderson
OK. At that time, when X-Ray was being made, we all were... When I say we all, I had equipment, and Derrick had equipment, and Juan had already had a few releases with Cybotron. Actually he was on to... He might have been on to Model 500 as well. I always was observing the whole... Once me and Derrick ... There was a point where Derrick moved to Chicago. So the Chicago movement was in its early stages, we kept in contact over the phone. This was like 1982, but Juan’s got records out as Cybotron, obviously Clear came out in ’83, so ’82 was the beginning... ’82 going into ’83 was really my beginning as far as my inspiration and changing my path. I was playing football and I decided, “Oh, I’m going to be a DJ.” I hadn’t thought about the music part but I knew I was going to be a DJ and I was starting trying to figure it out. That was before X-Ray because X-Ray might have came two years later. So there was a lot of stuff going before we even got that far. But by the time we got to that point, Derrick was... Yeah, he was working on tracks, he had a place downtown near Wayne State and he had some equipment, I had some equipment, Eddie Fowlkes had some equipment, Juan, we all had pieces of equipment. And sometimes we would bring it together. If he needed me to bring my 909, whatever, then I would bring it down to his house. Tracks got formulated like that because now you can complete a track because you had the equipment. I was around when everybody was making their tracks. I mean, Juan was kind of just in his own world, he was well above us as far as his knowledge, his skill level, and he had records out. But that was kind of the beginning for Derrick for sure and, I’m trying to think, Eddie had a track that he was working on. Like I said, we were all working on music. X-Ray was probably finished before Eddie’s track but Juan wanted to release Eddie’s track first, so that’s what I remember. Christine Kakaire
Yeah and it’s interesting to kind of go through Discogs and try to figure out the lines but it’s all overlapping. It seemed like everyone had their own record label, everyone was bringing their friends in to collaborate. So actually, this is probably a good point to ask about setting up record labels because from the start you had KMS, Juan had Metroplex, Derrick had Transmat. What was the significance of having your own record labels this early in the game? Kevin Saunderson
OK, so yeah, Juan had Metroplex, then Derrick led into Transmat. Actually my first record came out on Metroplex. It actually... Christine Kakaire
Kreem. Kevin Saunderson
The first version came out on Metroplex Records and I was like, I was kind of observant and I was like, well shoot I could do that, I can give it to the DJs, I can promote it, I wanted to do it myself. You know because I felt like I wanted to control what I wanted to do with my record and then I could tell like I gave it to Juan and it felt like I didn’t know what was going on so I was like, “Juan, I want my record back.” And you know, he was cool about it, he was cool and he said, “No problem.” So I got it back, did some remixes and that’s when KMS started. I started that. I wanted to start because of the reason I just said, I wanted to be able to... I didn’t want nobody to tell me how to put my music out, how to play it. I wanted to control that and I didn’t want to be tied to anyone else’s timeline. Christine Kakaire
So this is the Kreem release you’re talking about? Well let’s fast forward to this first instance of you getting a production and writing credit on a record. So this is you and Juan Atkins as Kreem. I’m gonna play the track "Triangle Of Love," which I think is like a direct predecessor for what comes later, particularly with the use of vocals, so let’s listen to a little bit of "Triangle Of Love." (music: Kreem – Triangle Of Love") So that was a little bit of "Triangle Of Love" by Kreem. How did that track come together because to me I can definitely hear elements of the kind of music that you’d be hearing at Paradise Garage, especially the vocal. How did that all come together? Kevin Saunderson Well, I like vocal music, I like melodies, and I thought about Paradise Garage and when I decided I was gonna make my first record, somehow I wanted it to be a vocal record. I fell into that path. So before the vocals, and trying to put this track together, basically it was really just a lot of drums and different elements. The musical part really didn’t come in until later, and Juan played a very important role because I had... First of all I had a different bassline, so Juan changed the bassline. What I told Juan is, “I got this track, I feel like it’s almost finished but I don’t know how to finish it,” because at that time my production level was nowhere near like Juan’s. I know how to do some drums, I can maybe play a bassline and hum out a melody or get a keyboard player to play it for me like I think I want it. So I got all that and I got like eight tracks, so I’m working with a Fostex eight-track. I got seven actually I think, because you gotta leave one for the sync. But I don’t know how to finish the track, so everything is playing, there’s no arrangement it’s just like everything is just playing straight and I got my drums and my rows and everything is just going but I’m like, “Well what do you do from here?” Because I never actually seen anyone finish the track. We all got together and you could see Derrick and everybody working on stuff but never knew how to finish it. So Juan, I called up, I told him I needed him to help me finish this song. So Juan basically said, “All right, well how much money you got?” That’s what he said. I said, “Man I ain’t got no money.” He said, “Well, what kind of pieces of equipment you got?” So I had to... I had a sampler and I wasn’t really into using samplers so I just had this sampler, it was the Akai 800 or something like that, if I remember correctly. So I said, “I got this sampler over here.” He said, “That’ll work.” So he came over and finished the track. But now I see Juan, I’m right there with him so I could see how he mixing and how he arranging. He decided to change the bassline, which later I found out was kind of like an influence from New Order, at the time I didn’t even know. But then he mixed it and I was missing those elements, like how to mix it and take it to two-track and make sections and splice it together, your arrangement together, but I had no clue about that part. So once Juan showed me that I was off and rolling. I knew what to do and this is my first production but things elevated for me because now I got a record company, or I mean it came out on Juan’s label first but eventually I had my record company and I was able to... I didn’t need nobody to show me what to do no more so now there was no holding me back. Christine Kakaire
So in this period of having this masterclass from Juan about how to finish your tracks, and realizing that nothing is holding you back, you went into a period of high productivity, I understand. I believe you also needed to replace a vocalist. Was it the vocalist from that particular track who... Kevin Saunderson
Well, this track, the vocalist... I replaced her on the new version I released on my label. I worked with a guy named Duane Bradley. He played on the radio too. He played daytime, more or less. He did mix show. A decent ear for production, he was a good guy, and he was a fan, and he was into... He was like a New York version of... He was a Detroit guy but very New York-y as far as the music style he played and influences and the way he thought about production, so I worked with him on that next record and he was the one who was like, “Well, we need to work on these vocals,” That’s when I brought another vocalist in for that project, but then it changed again when Inner City came about because she just wanted to sing gospel so that was really my last time working with that singer. Christine Kakaire
So at this point enters Paris Grey, who I believe, you were telling me yesterday, you sent her the track, she wrote the vocals for “Big Fun” and then sung them to you over the phone, is that right? Kevin Saunderson
Yeah, yeah. So in between all this, I went from Kreem to working with Derrick and James Pennington on an EP at that time, and then I went into Reese & Antonio, so I had a few things going on but it was more underground, it was different. I wasn’t trying to be vocals. If it was vocals it was vocals like, “Bounce Your Body To The Box,” stuff like that, “Just Want Another Chance,” and then Paris came about as I had this music that I had already been working on with James Pennington that became “Big Fun.” She did write the lyrics and she sung it over the phone, I listened to it and I brought her to Detroit to do the vocals and we had to go to Juan’s studio because I needed more tracks again to, and Juan played another significant role. He mixed it for me. I knew how to mix at that time but I was like just, I was all over the place. Making tracks, doing this, you know. So Juan, he did the mix on it. The music was already there and he just finished it for me. Christine Kakaire
But that particular track kind of joined the archive of things that you were working on, I’m talking about “Big Fun” here. But it wasn’t until another person entered the picture by the name of Neil Rushton. It’d be great if you could talk about how you first encountered each other. Kevin Saunderson
Yeah Neil, he became my manager eventually, but I first came in contact with Neil through Derrick May. Derrick May met him because Derrick had “Strings Of Life” going on, big buzz. Neil contacted Derrick saying, “Hey man, I want to license this record,” and Derrick was like, “It’s too late I already gave it to...” whoever he had signed it to and so Neil told him, “Well, if you ever run into any problems later on down the line,” or he said, “If you ever have any issues or anything, you need some advice, just give me call.” So, Derrick ran into some issues, got in contact with Neil, they started building their relationship and Derrick actually ended up going to England, to meet Neil. He met Neil and hung out there for whatever, a week or two, came back, told us his experience in England and what was going on over there and the music he was hearing from us over there and Chicago and all that. Beause he was the first one to travel like that, so we went off of his word basically what was going on over there, and Neil ended up coming back to Detroit to meet myself, Juan, Eddie, just the whole crew, Blake Baxter, I guess Mike [Banks] too. Members Of The House and whoever else I might have forgot at that time that was on that album, but he listened. He met with us all separately, listened to all our music and “Big Fun” was one of the tracks I played for him that ended up getting licensed on this Detroit techno compilation that eventually came out with “Big Fun” on it and all the other Detroit producers, DJs at the time. Christine Kakaire
Yes that compilation was called Techno! The New Dance Sound Of Detroit and from what I understand, I don’t know if it’s myth or reality, was that Neil Rushton and had put together a compilation of Chicago music and it was Chicago house and the intention was to call this Detroit house but at some point the word techno was adopted. So you have any insight about that? Kevin Saunderson
Well, I don’t really remember but I know Juan, this is what Juan tells me, that’s what I hear that it was called house, or the sound of Detroit House, whatever it was called, but and Juan said, “No, no, no, no this is techno, Detroit techno.” So that’s what Juan says that he told Neil, “We’re gonna call this Detroit techno,” and that’s... and Juan always called it techno. I knew techno from Juan from the very beginning. I didn’t even know the word techno until I heard Juan say the word techno and that was always his theory. Christine Kakaire
It’s great to hear you speak with such a reverence for Juan because the three of you, you’re known as the Belleville Three, Juan, Derrick, and yourself, but within that you all have your superhero names. Like Juan is the originator, Derrick is the innovator, and you are the elevator. And I think this would be a fantastic opportunity to watch a couple of videos from this compilation, the biggest hit which went on to become a single, and turned into this amazing video that we’re gonna see, was “Big Fun.” And I was so thrilled that I watched this video closely last night and asked you earlier if that’s you dancing in the background and it definitely is. Christine Kakaire
So let’s have a look at video number three which is Inner City’s first single, “Big Fun.” (video: Inner City – "Big Fun") So that was the video for Big Fun by Inner City. You said you hadn’t watched that video for a few years now, what’s it like seeing it back again? Kevin Saunderson
Bring back some amazing times, just a great time for music and how things evolved. It moves really quickly and, you know, 1987 is when I put my first record out on my label, 1988 I’m having this huge hit success a year or so later. I thought it was a dream. Christine Kakaire
I mean did you have a sense of how things were changing for you, coming from this like hotbed production community and then having a breakout hit like “Big Fun” which is being consumed almost like pop music where it’s all about the performer and the performance. How was that transition for you and for Paris? Kevin Saunderson
Well, I mean, I wanted to stay in the background pretty much and that was my whole plan. Christine Kakaire Literally. Kevin Saunderson Yeah, exactly, just like in the video. But I just wanted to make music and I wanted to be this great DJ. It did change things for me because I had to go on these shows and do all these like Top of the Pops and stuff like that, which at the beginning I definitely wasn’t comfortable doing but I did it because it was kind of the beginning. I had to learn my way and I was a developing artist. I was more a producer than an artist, for sure. I didn’t have the vision to want to be that kind of artist but it happened because of my inspiration, because I was blessed, and the timing and I wasn’t one-dimensional either. I like different forms of music, I like the dark, dirty underground shit too, but I like to sing a song too and feel it in my soul, so because of the success it came with it. Christine Kakaire
Speaking of Top of the Pops we do have a little clip of that that I’d love to play as well. Kevin Saunderson
Oh boy. [laughter] Christine Kakaire
But of course you have this big breakout hit and at that time, it was kind of towards the beginning of 1988, is that correct? Kevin Saunderson
It was like September, October the record might've came out. Christine Kakaire OK. Kevin Saunderson
But it came out on my label, it came out on the compilation, so it was bubbling like crazy throughout the whole summer. Christine Kakaire But of course, as is the case in record label land, big major label land, if you have a hit you’re expected to deliver another hit, which you did with “Good Life,” which alongside with “Big Fun” formed the basis of this album, and I think it’s worth mentioning just how popular this album and these tracks were. I think eight of these tracks made it onto the British Top 100 in terms of single sales. Kevin Saunderson
Yeah I don’t know if it was eight, it was definitely five for sure. I believe five for sure. Christine Kakaire
And you had a similar success in the US with the Billboard Dance Charts as well. Kevin Saunderson
Definitely, definitely. Christine Kakaire
Okay well let’s have just a little look at this video from Top of the Pops because I think it’s worth reinforcing how much of a crossover act Inner City had become. So if we could play, let’s just play a minute and a half of this video of Inner City performing “Good Life” at Top of the Pops in December, 1988. (video: Inner City – “Good Life” (live on Top Of The Pops)) What are your memories from that? Do you have any memories from that? Were you kind of directed, told what to do? Kevin Saunderson
Just felt uncomfortable, a lot of anxiety. Like, “What the hell am I doing up here?” I mean really, that’s how I felt. Christine Kakaire
It’s funny because you’re just like endlessly queuing this one record in the background it’s amazing. Kevin Saunderson
You know it was just moving so quick and I’m a studio producer so it’s like, you’re out of your environment really because you’re not in the studio, so things have changed obviously now. You can basically take your studio on the road with you and perform and do stuff that you at least used to do or that you do in the studio, but it’s still a great experience. Paris was the star, she needed to be the star and I just played whatever role I needed to play to be a part, because I was a part. Christine Kakaire
OK so you talked about you were a studio person, you wanted to be in the studio, you were in the studio, so I think this is probably a good time to follow another pretty epic line of your discography. I didn’t realize until you mentioned this to me yesterday but you are credited with creating the first dance remix, in terms of not just doing an edit but essentially gutting a track and reforming it in a different context, so it’d be great to hear a little bit about this work that you also did in 1988. Kevin Saunderson
Yeah I went to England, as Neil was trying to get me work in the market, so he asked me, and I think Derrick also, did we want to do some remixes while we were over there, try and do a little DJ tour, it’s early days and promoting the techno compilation. So early ’88 I took on this project called the Wee Papa Girl Rappers and it was for Jive Records. I hadn’t heard the track, these days you listen to the track, you decide if you want to do it but it was just like, “Do you wanna do a remix on this track?” So I was like, “Sure, I’ll do whatever. I’m here.” I wanted to make time go by while I was there and do something with my time at the same time so I worked on this track. I went in the studio, heard the track for the first time. I was like, “What the hell am I gonna do with this track?” I didn’t know what I was gonna do with it because I was used to making music, my music, not taking somebody else's tracks and trying to make them work for me. Then I knew like, OK, people like Shep Pettibone and Jellybean Benitez and all them was doing remixes, a lot of disco stuff, which extended it and made it easy for DJs to play. So I had a challenge there, if I was gonna go that direction I felt like it wasn’t anything that I would play myself. If I edit it and make it, and extend it, it still wouldn’t fit to where I wanted to get, so my approach was to lose everything and to make a track, and make sure it was in the same key, and take a bit of the vocals, and use it over my track and that’s how that kinda happened. And then it was like the first time that had happened, so the record company... I mean I did it and then instantly it was something I felt like I could play, that fit into what was going on at the same time. So the record company, they... I mean I don’t actually think they hated it, they just couldn’t believe it, and the artists couldn’t believe it as well because the producers were Fine Young Cannibals I think, of the actual track, and they weren’t very happy about it but somehow I guess they let some other people hear it, they gave it some DJs and it just, it blew up from that, and all of a sudden I’m doing all these remixes, kind of just following the same format and other people are following that and that’s how that ended up happening, basically. Christine Kakaire
The inspiration begins again with the remixes. But I think that we should listen to just a little snippet of the original version of this track which is called “Heat It Up” by Wee Papa Girl Rappers which is a British hip-house duo, twin sisters. And then we’ll listen to your Detroit House Mix directly afterwards. (music: Wee Papa Girl Rappers – “Heat It Up”) (music: Wee Papa Girl Rappers – “Heat It Up (Detroit House Mix)”) So that was the Detroit House Mix of Wee Papa Girl Rappers. Where did you start with this track? I mean, you talked about wanting to strip all the bits that you didn’t want away, do you remember how you actually made it? Kevin Saunderson
I just used the vocals and I had to use some trigger device, I can’t remember what it was, where I could sample like 30 seconds... No not 30 seconds, like five seconds, ten seconds, something like that. You can only do that amount and I was able to trigger that vocal to make that “It’s like that” layer. I think I started with that, working it over some drums and I got a TB-303. That might have been the first or second time I worked with a 303. I just filled it out, built drums, a little bass and just kept working it until I felt like it was working. Christine Kakaire
What’s your working process like because you seem to be somebody who is especially prolific and working on a range of things, particularly around this time period. Are you a start to finish kind of person? Do have numerous projects going at the same time? Has your process changed over time? Kevin Saunderson
Well back in those days, when you went in the studio and I got a 24-hour block, I was done within 24 hours. Sometimes I was done in 12 hours. The only thing that kept me from completing a project was if we had technical difficulties and there was plenty of technical difficulties with using tape. If you needed to use anything from the actual track or you needed to really use the vocals, just didn’t have the technology that you have now to do it. And then I had all the time in the world. I was young and I didn’t have any commitments so I could just work endlessly in the studio as I did back in Detroit and that’s why I had all these tons of aliases ‘cause I just kept making music and I was like, “I‘ma just gonna put that under that brand. I’ma put it out under that,” ‘cause I just wanted so much music to come out. So that was my approach on remixes and I think now, if I make a track, I will sometimes play it... I make it just for me and I might play it for two or three months, just play it in my sets before I even revisit it. It’s a different approach. You know, with technology you can test stuff out a little different. It’s just a different time now. I think people tend to take their time with tracks a lot more than we did back then. And I mean even me, you know I’m all over the place, I’m still playing all around the world, I have a family, so I try to balance everything. And I don’t have any super commitments to finishing anything ‘cause I don’t really have to unless I feel like I need to. And then when it’s finished, it’s finished. Or when I feel like it’s finished, it’s finished. Christine Kakaire
[laughs] OK, you mentioned your aliases and I do want to talk about Reese in particular. But you also just mentioned your family and I think it’s worth noting that KMS Records and Inner City has become something of a family affair. Is it two of your adult sons who are on the same path as you? Kevin Saunderson
Well, well, OK. So Dantiez, one of my sons, he runs KMS more or less, A&Rs it, puts out records, every now and again I’ll bring a record into the whole pot and say, “Hey, we should put this out.” But he also is... He’s partnering up with Inner City, so the new music... We got a track out now, we got a track coming out in another month I think, anything that’s new from Inner City, he’s doing 90% of the music and he’s moving on with that project. There’s no longer... Paris Grey is no longer part of Inner City because she is basically retired. He wanted to take on the project, I thought it was good and I gave him some coaching and I’m still a part of that. My other son, they work together on tracks as the Saunderson Brothers and they work individually too, so it’s a family affair too, and we have a studio that never stops. I guarantee somebody is using it right now. [laughter] Christine Kakaire
Okay, let’s revisit one of your aliases, Reese. I’m gonna play a little part of a track called “Just Want Another Chance.” And this is also from 1988. And then we’re gonna talk a little bit about it afterwards. (music: Reese – "Just Want Another Chance") So that was “Just Want Another Chance” by Reese, which is one of your aliases. Tell us about that bassline in that track? Kevin Saunderson
You know when I was creating that bass, I was thinking dark, deep, I was thinking Paradise Garage. And I created it on a CZ-1000. So I just got into the parameters which I always enjoyed doing because sometimes when you’re creating sounds, it can inspire you to play a certain way or you hear something that inspires you to play something on top of that. And you can also change your direction, I’ve played lines that were just okay sounding, but all of a sudden, I get into parameters and I’ve morphed that and changed it in a way where all of a sudden it’s amazing, the line, where you wouldn’t think I would get that out of it. Experimentation, just experimentation with no rules. That’s as simple as that. Christine Kakaire
And so this particular bassline was taken to by drum & bass producers, and jungle producers in the UK. So what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna play a little bit of a track called “Terrorist.” Which is by an act called Renegade which was Ray Keith and Gavin Cheung, and this is from 1994, and you can hear that exact same bassline in this track, so let’s have a listen. (music: Renegade – “Terrorist”) So this lifting of that element of your track came out six years after “Just Want Another Chance.” At what point did you become aware that this bassline, and then, after that, the bassline treatment, became the 'Reese bassline' which is such a staple of drum & bass and jungle music now? Kevin Saunderson
Well I used to hang out in London a lot. I used to hang out with Fabio & Grooverider, so I used to you know used to always talk about, “Oh man, your bass, your bass!” So until I went actually to hear him play, it seemed like every three or four records, every track I heard, it was some form of that bass sound, it had been sampled, or replayed. I don’t know what year, whenever they was at... I think it was Heaven, I don’t know what the night was called. It was in London. But I recognized it through them before I... I mean I didn’t know because I was just hanging out listening to them play drum & bass. And I was like, “Wow, every three or four records, here come another Reese bass,” you know? So it became definitely a staple and it sat in many, many, many tunes, I know that, so. It was also a compliment in a way. Hey, they didn’t create it, but they was able to grab it and use it creatively. Christine Kakaire
Yeah. OK so the last section that I want to talk about, which I think brings this conversation... Rounds it off quite nicely. You talked about hanging out in the UK with big drum & bass DJs at that point in time, people who were taking music that was kind of coming from that hardcore continuum and elements of ragga and elements of techno as well. You have another alias named, E-Dancer, which is known for being quite no-nonsense, tough, dark, dancefloor-driven tracks. That’s an alias that first arrived around 1991. But what I would like to play is... OK, so there’s a pretty well known track of the E-Dancer discography from ’97, I believe, called “Velocity Funk.” And again, through deep diving into Discogs, I realized that the origins of this track is a remix that you had done for the electro-funk group Cameo in 1991. So this period of the late ’80s, early ’90s, where did you find the hours in the day? But also how did this remix come together? Because you specifically called it The Hardcore Mix, so you were making a nod to the stuff that was going on in the UK which was influenced by what you’d been doing, so tell us all about it. Kevin Saunderson
I was hanging out in the UK, so I would go to raves and all that, and part of it I really liked, and some of the music I really hate, but there was elements that was interesting. And sections that was really good. So I was influenced, I would say subconsciously, and when I got into the studio, especially when I was working a remix, I was like, “I’m just gonna mess around with this,” you know? And see how it come out. And I ended up liking it. So it was Cameo. And I thought it was just a bizarre mixture of music and the artist. ‘Cause I grew up listening to Cameo. So, the record company released it, majors, especially back then, they didn’t really know what they had, they might put it there a little, promote it, under-promote it, whatever. It kind of floated out to some people, many people didn’t get it, so I decided to just go back and redo it and use it as an E-Dancer. So that’s how you noticed that and then the change over. Christine Kakaire
OK. Well let’s listen to a little bit of the original of “Money” by Cameo and then directly after that, I’m gonna play “Velocity Funk.” And then we can wrap up before we open it up to questions. (music: Cameo – “Money”) (music: E-Dancer – “Velocity Funk”) I mean it’s almost impossible to imagine putting those two tracks together, but with the remix which you did, which unfortunately I don’t have, you managed to do that. But what I want to do before we open it up to questions, is ask about how inspiration and reiteration is still continuing with you. I know that with your E-Dancer project, you put out an album in 1998, called Heavenly and I believe it was last year there was Heavenly Revisited, and it kind of continues to iterate itself as does Belleville Three, you’ve been doing live shows. It would be great to get a sense of how all of these strands of your projects are still continuing to evolve now. Kevin Saunderson
Well I'm not gonna have 10,000 aliases like before, so really i'm just doing Inner City, I’m doing E-Dancer now. So what I decide when I play E-Dancer, I decided a couple years ago I want to revisit it and do some tweaks, but sometimes the new generations don’t find the music from the past so I thought what was a way to connect the two, and then maybe they’ll go back and find the original album if they like what they hear. With the new album it was really still mainly the old album, with just some modifications as far as mixing and some slight arrangement things. Maybe adding some fills, I did stuff like that with ...Revisited. And I also added two or three new E-Dancer tracks to that record as well. So I just felt like it was necessary. I’ve been doing this for 30-something years, and I felt like the music is still great, I think it’s still important. So I’ve done that. And I’ve been doing some live shows featuring some of those tracks in some of the live shows. I’ve also worked on another version that’s gonna be coming out that’s totally downtempo, totally ambient, very relaxed but very strong, with the same music. But it’s gonna surprise people. Very orchestrated. Stuff like that is a challenge, but it inspires me to take those chances and do what you want to do, and try to do what you want to do and achieve. So I’ve done that with E-Dancer and some of that will be coming very soon. With Belleville Three, me, Derrick and Juan decided to get together and tour, and the original concept was, “Let’s tour and let’s put some of our great tracks together and let’s do a live tour.” And go to some of our favorite places around the world and just do it properly, something that we haven’t done, and maybe add a few new tracks or tracks by each other, or maybe collab on two or three tracks and add it to the project.
Well the process took longer than anticipated trying to get there. So what we end up doing is doing a DJ tour for four, five dates, having three individual setups. So that’s what we ended up trying, it worked 50% of the time. I mean when do something like that, it’s totally an experiment, ‘cause you’ve got three different minds, three different ways of thinking, we’re not sitting down practicing and trying to format anything. It’s more like whatever happens, happens. You get on stage, either it’s gonna sound like shit or it’s gonna sound great. Sometimes you have amazing moments too that you cannot recapture either, so what we decided was we not gonna do that. If we go back out together, it will be completely live, playing some of our classic records and hopefully a couple new tracks together, so that’s kind of the next phase of that, Belleville Three. Christine Kakaire
Well hopefully you’ll be elevating for another 30 years. Kevin Saunderson
Hey, as long as I stay healthy, I’ll be here. Christine Kakaire
Please thank Kevin Saunderson. [applause] So at this point we’ll open up to questions particularly from our participants. If you have any please raise your hand. Audience member Respect Kevin. Kevin Saunderson Hey. Audience member Yeah I was just wondering when was the moment that you created this timeless techno stuff that has been used countless times. When was the moment that you created that style? Kevin Saunderson Oh when did I create it? Audience member Yeah. Kevin Saunderson Oh man, 1985, ’86, ’87. Yeah ’87, ’86, ’87, all that, ’88. You know all that stuff was created back then. But it still began, it really began in ’82, ‘cause you know the foundation was, learn how to be a DJ, then it was learn how to work a drum machine, then it was learn how to get a sequence and do a bassline and then it was just adding pieces to the puzzle and learning. So the development really was between ’82 and I would say ’87 before the first record came out. Audience Member Hey, thank you so much. I just want to ask, is there any particular contemporary dance music that you’re excited about? Anyone you want to mention? Kevin Saunderson I don’t even listen to... I don’t even look at titles. When I’m musically playing something or listening to something, I never looking at the titles, so I never know what the hell... Even if I am, if I think it’s great, I really don’t know. It’s not like back in the day were you really knew each record and each artist because I had all that time to be educated or really absorb it. So it's a different time for me. So when I hear shit, I mean I hear lots of great music and there’s still plenty of great music out there. But I can’t even give you a name or the artist or the act, just can’t. Audience Member You spoke quite a bit about the people who are influencing you as a producer and mentoring you there. But who are some of your mentors as a DJ that helped inspire your style in that particular format? Kevin Saunderson DJ wise, OK. Larry Levan. Tony Humphries. Ron Hardy. Derrick May. Even though me and Derrick is at the same age, Derrick, especially back then, just did amazing shit. He would take chances. And he was ruthless. It’s almost like being a sports guy, being a competitor at the same time. But having no fear. So that’s what I loved about Derrick. Ron Hardy just... Derrick was influenced from Ron Hardy. Ron Hardy was the first one messing with the high end, taking out the bass, low end, bringing it back in, crowd screaming. Keeping it out for two or three minutes, stuff like that. That’s some of the ones. Audience Member Could tell us about the music scene in the late ’80s, early ’90s in Detroit in terms of, were there many clubs? Were you going out? Were you even DJing that much in your home city? Because from what I’ve heard, sometimes a lot of pioneering musicians in America have never fully been appreciated in their home country or home city and have had to go to Europe to find success. So if you could tell us a bit about that. Kevin Saunderson So, back in those days, the first gigs... Juan was doing these Deep Space parties. He had this little following, and it was all urban black kids, basically. At least it was probably 95% just black. People from the cities, going to schools. And then it elevated from that to these kids going to college, to also following the music that Juan and then Eddy and then myself were creating. Derrick and all of us, Blake. And we were playing also. So the parties we were playing, the parties I was playing, were parties on the campus. Fraternity parties and events like that. We were actually playing at different universities, stuff like that. As far as clubs, there was a club called Cheeks, I remember the first time I went there I heard Al Ester. Great DJ, he could play, he was playing back then. We had Ken Collier playing and maybe a little later in the ’80s or early ’90s, I remember Heaven. What else in Detroit? I mean the Music Institute of course. The Music Institute was where Derrick's residency, it started out as me and Derrick's residency, but because of Inner City, I kind of got dragged out of the Music Institute to touring within the city and a guy named D-Wynn ended up taking my spot and playing there, ‘cause it was every an week thing, that was the place. That’s where Richie Hawtin, many people came that was within the surrounding area to be inspired hearing all this great music from Detroit and from Chicago, from wherever. So that’s kind of what was happening at the time. But we did have to go overseas and it was a gap for me because of Inner City. Some people didn’t even realize that I was a DJ, it took a while to kind of reestablish myself as a DJ. But we had to go overseas to really get that love and then it turned around with having our own festival in Detroit. I think in the US it’s better, much better than it was years ago, now, today. I play probably more in the US then I play in Europe and that was unheard of. Audience member Yeah I just wanted to ask about coming from America, when you guys first popped in Europe, do you remember the specific moment that that happened? And was there a specific person or a bridge that helped you guys establish yourselves in Europe? Kevin Saunderson Well I mean I would think 1988 is when it really took off because for me, obviously I had the Inner City success, but I had “Rock To the Beat.” I had all this other stuff going on, “Just Want Another Chance.” You had Derrick with “Strings Of Life,” Already had “Nude Photo” out. Then you had other cats coming in from Detroit like UR as that whole thing started to develop and Octave One started developing. Everything started, Carl Craig, so it all happened from the compilation. It all happened because of England, they jumped on board, and Neil Rushton was the person who introduced us. So that’s the specific person who got us over there. Even though we were over there in a way, it got us the deal that triggered other things. ‘Cause we triggered ourself because we put out records. We DJ’d and we controlled our own labels so no one could stop it, it's just where it was gonna be placed in the end. Audience member As somebody who's had many aliases, I’m just curious how did you come up with the names? Kevin Saunderson Man I would just sit back and listen to music and just daydream and just feel like, “It feels like that. This feels like that.” And then you know, sometimes I wanted it to be, she had mentioned like there was some influence with the UK rave scene right? So like Tronik House, that was specifically, I was gonna use some breaks. I knew I’m gonna start this track out, I’m gonna mess with some breaks and chop up some breaks and try to include that type of thing in there. But just sometimes I create the music and then came up with the aliases. It wasn’t really that I came up with the alias first, you know? Audience member Whatever fit the music. Kevin Saunderson Huh? Audience member Whatever fit the music. Kevin Saunderson Yeah, whatever fit the music and it felt like the Reese project, it was more soulful. It was a little more downtempo, it wasn’t as fast as some of the other stuff. It was different singers from Detroit. And everybody wanted me to produce them. I can’t produce everybody so I was like, well yeah I can put two or three tracks of you guys together and you all kind of got this gospel type effect. And I thought let me do... You trigger ideas like that. And then you make the music and it works. Audience member Cool. Audience member Hi. Kevin Saunderson Hello. Audience Member Thank you for sharing your story. I wonder, do you remember the first time you played in Berlin? And can you recall how you experienced the techno scene here when you came? Kevin Saunderson Man, I played Berlin. I don’t remember the first moment. Here’s what I do remember. Not as a DJ, I remember as Inner City, I played Berlin and I played right when the wall came down, right? So I remember walking over and getting a piece of the wall and we did this constant, big... It was with Kool & the Gang, and S.O.S. Band and Inner City and Diva something, I’m trying to think of her name. I can’t remember, but I think it was maybe 1989 and ’90. So I think that was the first time I even came over here. But I remember distinctly getting a piece of the wall, going on stage, holding it up and I did it like Inner City theme, like it was really a powerful, magnetic, special moment. And then through the years, I remember coming back and I seen the scene developing. I remember it being very fast, very dark, very aggressive, but they had a buried underground scene going on. I do remember that. Christine Kakaire I think that’s the final question. So once again, thank you Kevin Saunderson. [applause] Kevin Saunderson All right, thank you, thank you.

Kara-Lis Coverdale
Playing music at a young age does not a prodigy make, though it certainly helped Canadian composer Kara-Lis Coverdale. A student of piano throughout her childhood in rural Ontario, she became organist and composing music director at a local church at 14. After earning an MA in musicology and composition, Coverdale moved to Montréal. In addition to working as the organist for a local church, she befriended esteemed sound artist Tim Hecker, who recruited her to play on his albums Virgins (2013) and Love Streams (2016). Then, in 2015, Coverdale released her solo debut, Aftertouches. Using synthetic instruments sourced from VSTs, sound banks, and personal archives, she blurred the lines between electronic and acoustic music, as well as the secular and the non-secular. Since then, she’s played festivals like MUTEK and Unsound, and in 2017 released Grafts, on which she processed and looped vocal samples to create cool and melodic modal compositions.
In her lecture at Red Bull Music Academy 2018 in Berlin, Coverdale talked collaboration, working with her Estonian musical heritage and how architecture informs and influences her creative process.
Hosted by Shawn Reynaldo Joining me on the couch today is a composer, a piano player, an organist, an experimental artist. Just a very talented woman. She hails from Canada, currently lives in Montreal. Please help me in welcoming Kara-Lis Coverdale. [applause] I want to start out today, I just listed off all of these different things that you do, and I thought it might be helpful to just start by playing a piece of music from you and then we could talk about it. This is something that came out in 2014, and it’s the title track of, I guess it’s an album or a cassette, it was called A 480. Do you call it an album? Kara-Lis Coverdale I guess you could call it an album, yeah. Shawn Reynaldo All right. We’ll talk more about it after we hear it. let’s just check this out for a couple minutes. (music: Kara-Lis Coverdale – “A 480”)
[applause] I want to talk specifically about this piece, but just as a little bit of background, you are a classically trained musician, as they say. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah. Shawn Reynaldo When did you start playing piano? Kara-Lis Coverdale Five. Shawn Reynaldo And when did you start actually composing? Kara-Lis Coverdale I guess it was a little bit later, like ten maybe. Shawn Reynaldo Oh yeah, really old. When this release came out, I thought one thing that was really interesting is that it came with a sort of score. Could you do me a favor and pull up image number two right now? That’s the score that came along with the record. It doesn’t really look... Can you explain what the hell that is? Because it certainly doesn’t look like the usual set of notes composed on. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, I guess it’s a graphic score, essentially. All notation is a graphic, think of it that way. But A 480, I guess to answer the question I’d have to back up a little bit. At that time, I was working a lot with digital downloading technologies and investigating source allocation I guess, with media, and getting into the source of the musical objects I was using to create music. And I was particularly interested in the sample pack at the time. This was... I was writing things around 2012, 2013. It was released a little later. The work I wanted to index... The point that more increasingly, people were working with sound files instead of sound objects, and I wanted to make the work downloadable and turn into a treasure hunt for people who did have the score. So it’s a way of seeing the way that the stems are organized in a grid-like structure. When I ended up sending out the score, a lot of people embarked on this hunt to figure out where the sources came from. It was actually from a sample library created in California, but it was at this seminal time where the idea that one source could end up at any location and property rights around music production started to fall apart at that time. So it was indexing that whole sphere of economy around music. Shawn Reynaldo So on that track we just heard, essentially it was all constructed of vocal samples from a sample pack? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah. Shawn Reynaldo What made you think that that was a rich-earth to source for making your music? Especially coming from a classical background? Kara-Lis Coverdale I guess that I was studying... I’ve just always been a big music fan as well as someone who makes music. This was the direction I saw. I mean most of you probably work with samples, almost all of you probably. But from the tradition I came from, this very much isn’t part of the vocabulary, at all, of what music is. And when I was studying, even when I was doing my masters, it was very much like I had to fight my way through the academy in order... It’s not like this space, I had to really... I was one of the first people writing on that kind of stuff, and it still wasn’t taken very seriously at the time. Shawn Reynaldo Let’s talk a bit more about your time gravitating from classical composition to more experimental territory. Did that start while you were getting your masters in a proper academy? Kara-Lis Coverdale I think it started far earlier, when I was young, just being an outsider in many ways. But I was very much... I was a good student, I would say. At the same time, I did my two hours every day practice, that kind of thing. I was quite vigilant about that and very dedicated throughout my entire life. But I guess I’ve always been an advocate of individualism in music, and experimentalism is the only avenue that allows that. I mean when you’re a music student, your entire first 15, 20 years of production is all about fitting into someone else’s glove and then you try on all these different personalities and these different ideas and ways of being, ways of thinking and ways of feeling.
And then eventually, you have to make your own glove. And I think experimentalism was the best way to go through that. Classical music is also a really weird word because classical really only refers to the 18th century, but of course, when you’re classical, in the common understanding of the word, or in the non-common understanding of the word rather, it actually encompasses anything from year one of human existence, or the earth and the wind. Shawn Reynaldo When you were getting started as a child, you are not only in this really structured environment, but it was also a competitive environment as well. Correct? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah. I did competitions, that kind of thing. Shawn Reynaldo Were you successful in these competitions? Kara-Lis Coverdale I was very competitive at the time, but I was pretty relaxed also, I think, sometimes. Shawn Reynaldo How would you be competitive? Were you sabotaging the competitions? Kara-Lis Coverdale No. I was very internally focused, maybe I was competitive with myself, I would say. And then supportive of anyone else who was doing the same thing. It’s not really about beating the person next to you, it’s about your internal victories, let’s say. So yeah, in that sense, I was always a tightly wound coil, I guess. Shawn Reynaldo Were you a little stress case around the house when you had a competition? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah. The day of performance week or competition week was always very intense because... I mean even the classical upbringing, I guess we’re going to go into this as an angle, anyone here who has had kind of that training can sympathize with the idea that the third bar in the second cadenza has four 16th notes and there’s a crescendo across those four and if you decrescendo then you’re playing that segment wrong. So it’s a hyper-performative practice that is expected to be reiterated in immaculate detail. And so there’s a lot of information, especially, I think, for a young kid. It’s not really a freeing sense of music production. Shawn Reynaldo What was your first real exposure to finding freedom in music? When did you first start to veer out of just playing piano and doing these competitions? Kara-Lis Coverdale I actually had a lot of avenues for just doing weird stuff at home. I played other instruments a lot that there was no pressure around, or no existing tradition. I guess that’s kind of the problem, when you have tradition around an instrument, there’s this whole... It’s not really a problem, it can be very beautiful, but there’s an entire technique library. But I had an accordion around that I shredded a lot and that was fun. One of the first things I saved up for as a kid was a boombox. It was like $400, Sony Mega Bass, with the singular Mega Bass buttons that you could boost the bass. It had two tape players in it so you could dub off the radio, and a CD player in the top. I actually didn’t understand it as a creative act at the time, to do that kind of musical activity, or I didn’t consider it something that I would share to a teacher or something. That wasn’t until much later, in maybe 2007, that I got more into that seriously. Shawn Reynaldo I think it’s worth noting that while you are messing around with this Mega Bass button in your boombox, what environment were you living in? Kara-Lis Coverdale I was in the country, Yeah. I was in the country, I grew up in the country. My closest neighbor was maybe a kilometer and a half away, so I was an internet kid in many regards, and I started with downloading at around that time. And those outside voices were very important for me, maybe more important than they were for somebody who was living in an urban area because they were that much more fresh, or just hearing it for the first time when you’re growing up around grass and stuff is different than street clammer or whatever. Shawn Reynaldo Weren’t you really into Mobb Deep and Wu-Tang Clan? Kara-Lis Coverdale I got into them in high school. Shawn Reynaldo Did their stories of street knowledge really relate to your rural Ontario experience? What did you connect with in that music? Kara-Lis Coverdale Well, when I was 16 I got a car with my butter tart money, I worked at a butter tart store. Shawn Reynaldo What is butter tart for the non-Canadians? Kara-Lis Coverdale It’s a Canadian delicacy. It’s this weird tart that has a... You fold the tart, and I was called the “Queen of Sheeta” at the time, because you have to sheet the dough down and put it through this dough press and it goes through five or six times, then you stamp out these little circular things and then you put them into a pan. I was a machine with this, I was the fastest and I had the best, most perfect tart shells. Shawn Reynaldo So apparently your competitive nature extended outside of the piano realm? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, I like speed and repetitive things. [laughs] Shawn Reynaldo And while you were growing up in the country and doing piano competitions and listening to Mobb Deep at home... Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah that’s why I started talking about the butter tarts, because rap sounds really good in the car. I always had the big CD bible and just liked listening to good shit. Shawn Reynaldo Was it the lyrics or was it the music? Kara-Lis Coverdale It was the music, but it was also the lyrics. I mean, I knew them. But generally with music, I’m much more of a sonic person than a textual one. I comprehend the inflection of the voice, the delivery and the intent and the emotional weight behind it but the actual word itself registers second. So yeah, but I always loved the productions and I was always trying to make them on the piano and whatever I had around, but of course... You quite quickly discover that you can’t capture [Mobb Deep's] "Hell on Earth" on your acoustic piano in your living room. So then there was another avenue of “How do I enrich things I make with the artifact of recording technology?” I think that rap production was the very first electronic music I really listened to and was into in that regard. Shawn Reynaldo I really like the idea of you trying to recreate RZA beats on piano at home. Especially because I know you were also actively playing at the church. Can you tell me a bit about the role that the church had in your upbringing and in your musical story? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, so when I was 14 I started as a church organist, and that was a funny time. It was kinda rough at first because there’s so much repertoire to learn as a... I remember being overwhelmed for many weeks and being like, “This is too much for me.” But after a while you just learn all the music and it just comes out, but my family’s also part Estonian so I grew up going to Estonian school and Estonian church and stuff like that. Estonian summer camp. This was an Estonian church so it’s not very many people there. And anyways, they would ask me to play piano often and accompany people, just as a way to exercise my ability. And then the organist who was there, Eva Rammo, she eventually just asked me if I wanted to take over and I said sure. It was a good job for me for many, many years. I was there for quite a minute. Shawn Reynaldo Are you religious? Or were you religious personally at the time? Kara-Lis Coverdale I wanted to play music and the pipe organ was an amazing instrument. I mean, I still think of it as the first synthesizer. It is the first synthesizer. And it was actually quite integral with how I started thinking about layering sounds and pitches and thinking about timbral writing instead of just harmonic writing, of course because the vocabulary of the piano is quite monochromatic. So to think about how I could, bandoneon or there are some flutes or diapason, all these different textures and colors was a really interesting world. And then also with the bass footboard, it also was really interesting to me. So I wouldn’t saying it was a religious calling or anything, I think most organists would agree that it’s more of a musical calling. Shawn Reynaldo Was it ever strange to be playing your music in an environment that comes with a lot of, let’s say, historical baggage and a lot of philosophical baggage as well. I mean, I assume you’re waiting in between sermons to play your music but you’re still hearing the sermons each week. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah I think it’s a little different for me also because the services were in another language. Shawn Reynaldo Were they in Estonian? Kara-Lis Coverdale They were, but I speak Estonian. But the language used in church is another level. I just... Be preparing my things in my head, when I had to play. Sure there’s a certain tone there, and I think the architecture is one of them, of the space and the arrangement. The way that with the organ your back is always turned to everybody rather than in other performance situations, you’re facing. So there’s a degree of anonymity that comes with performing, at least in the church tradition I was working in, that kinda comes with it. You’re there to share a musical object rather than your personal object. Ultimately I think that just made my music better. Shawn Reynaldo Well you’ve mentioned the role of Estonian culture and identity and I want to talk a little more about that, but first I thought we should play something. This is from a piece that you put together in Estonia, I believe, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Estonian republic, correct me if I’m wrong. Can you tell me just a bit about this project and then we’ll listen to some of it? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, this project was last year and the director of the first Estonian-speaking theater got in touch with me because he was interested in doing work around language, exclusively, and the multiplicity of language. The idea of what comes first, the natural world or the language we use to describe the natural world? And all of these meta ideas around communication, I would say. He got in touch with me because I talk about vocal work a lot and the manipulation of the voice and altering sonic identity in ways that can flip meaning, and we started working on it last year and I ended up focusing more on... Actually the work originally was meant to investigate the early 20th century, because there was a massive explosion with the technological revolution at the time,
there was a lot of growth in the medical sciences and so all over the world there was a massive expansion of language generally, but in Estonia in particular there was the language father, they call him. There’s many different linguists that have their different approaches to the expansion of language. It’s very individualized. But with Estonia, they tend to expand language from within language, so it’s an internal growth. But I wanted to focus on the hyper-futuristic aspect of Estonian economy. That word keeps coming up today. Estonia’s the first digital ID nation and they invented Skype and there’s lots of super modern things going on there but they’re also a medieval culture in many ways. It’s like this hyper-future, hyper-past dichotomy. So I found this coding book one time when I was coming back from Riga. No, Cēsis actually, in Latvia, and I was on the train after this crazy night in Cēsis. And coming back to work on the piece and I found this coding book in an old Russian-built train station in a weird open library. It was very surreal, the whole encounter with this library in the train station. It was so deserted but immaculate and it was coming out of Soviet times. And then this coding book appeared, and for the work I ended up extracting several excerpts from within that book and then I had these singers from the theater sing them out so there’s... That’s what this is. Shawn Reynaldo All right. Simple concept. What’s the name of this piece? Kara-Lis Coverdale The name of the entire piece is “Marjamaa Laulud,” which is... Yeah. It’s like “songs of this country,” I guess you could say. Shawn Reynaldo All right. Let’s listen. Just for reference, the piece is 29 minutes long, we’re only going to hear the first four or five minutes of it. So let’s check this out. (music: Kara-Lis Coverdale - “Marjamaa Laulud”) [applause] Can you tell us the name of that piece again? ‘Cause I can’t pronounce Estonian. Kara-Lis Coverdale “Marjamaa Laulud.” Shawn Reynaldo And just to clarify, so the voices we heard there was an Estonia choir reciting phrases that you got from a coding book. Kara-Lis Coverdale Written in Estonian, yes. Shawn Reynaldo So there really is a clash of modernity and history going on on several levels with that. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah and just also the chaos of my own personal experience I guess, as someone who travels a lot. Shawn Reynaldo I mean I want to ask about how you feel in relation to your Estonian heritage, ’cause it seems like you grew up going to Estonian church, your mother is Estonian, you learned the language but you grew up in Canada. Did you feel Estonian when you were growing up or did it feel just like this thing that your parents made you do? Kara-Lis Coverdale No, I felt Estonian. Very much. But everything my grandparents did was Estonian. Yeah it’s a very rich cultural existence being... It’s active work and there’s a really deep folk heritage there, especially with folk music and I was always active in choirs and I was always behind the piano accompanying choirs and... Not in the religious sense at all, I’m talking folk choirs. My mom has several folk choir records that she recorded with her buddies when she was a teenager. Beautiful records with amazing covers. My mom did all the graphic design and calligraphy. But yeah, there was a large community, but at the same time I felt a bit of an outsider again. That there was a little bit of a clique-y element around it sometimes. Yeah. I guess that’s maybe where I’m Canadian. [laughs] Shawn Reynaldo How did the experience of growing up Estonian in Canada compare with when you went to Estonia, and I believe you spent four months living there while you were making this piece? Kara-Lis Coverdale I did. That was my choice. I wanted to have feet on ground and take the time to make something that felt like an immediate document of what the country was like at the time and how I found myself as someone standing in it. But I had been to Estonia several times before. Mainly to visit family but also the trips were always organized around the choir festival that takes place every four years there. I don’t know if anyone here knows about it, I think it must be one of the largest choir festivals in the world, but Estonians are understood now and in the historical record to have sung themselves to freedom from Russian occupation. And so they formed this human singing chain across the Baltic states and imbued a lot of their choral work with protest lyrics, and they held several protest rallies through song all over Estonia. And to this day they preserve, despite that Estonia is now free, they preserve the tradition and remember their independence and what it took to acquire it again through these song festivals. And there’s 30,000 singers on stage at once, so you can imagine what that sounds like. It’s a pretty insane experience, but even a year and a half leading up to the festival, they commission composers to create new works and then they send out choir directors to each different choir all over the world because you have to audition in order to make it into the... You have to be serious and show your dedication to learning the repertoire. And so then they send out the directors to get everyone on the same page and then you all meet at the same time and there’s this procession through the city and everyone’s crying and everyone in the country comes to greet this choir. There’s about 110,000 people on this song festival grounds and there’s a torch and they take the torch up the tower and light the tower up, very Olympian kind of tradition. And then they sing these beautiful pieces together. Shawn Reynaldo When you had the Estonian choir singing these lines from a coding book you discovered, did they look at you like, “Why are you having us sing this stuff?” How collaborative was the process? Kara-Lis Coverdale It was quite collaborative. We talked about it throughout. And initially I was a little bit hesitant because... I wasn’t hesitant, I knew that they asked me to do the work because they knew what I’m into and so I had a certain element of confidence there, but sure, they had to assure me a few times that it was fine that I just go with my vision, because, of course, when you’re asked to do a project of that scale for an audience that’s nationwide rather than scene-wide. It was a little bit different so I felt like there were a lot of expectations. I had to sort out what I wanted to say and I had to make sure that it was poignant for the time so... But I think it turned out quite well. Although it was very modern, I will say. It was received in a very modern way. People were like, “This is very interesting.” Shawn Reynaldo I think being an organ player, or often times being a piano player, can be a very solitary endeavor. And even being an electronic producer can often be a solitary endeavor, but you’ve also done a lot of collaboration in the last several years. Can you talk about why you like to collaborate and what you get from the process? Kara-Lis Coverdale Collaboration’s about rubbing up against others, fundamentally. And sharing. I mean, it’s not really fun. The point of music is to sound out and to listen to other sounds being sounded out. Unless you just want to be in the black box forever and it’s not very fun. [laughs] With collaboration I tend to just go with my gut, and whatever is interesting for me or just listening for sympathetic resonance, and then also sometimes not. Some of the best collaborations have been the most unexpected ones also. Or also, ones that have been very difficult at first and then years later you can look back at it like, “Ah.” Shawn Reynaldo What was a difficult collaboration if you don’t mind spilling the beans? Kara-Lis Coverdale Well they are all a little bit difficult, aren’t they? I mean, in their special ways? Shawn Reynaldo I want to ask about one collaboration in particular. I mean, just to give people reference, you’ve worked with artists like How To Dress Well and Tim Hecker, but I actually want to ask about your work with LXV and you guys did a collaborative album together. Came out in 2015, it’s called Sirens. You actually never met in person before you started making this record. Can you talk about how that came about? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, I’d heard David’s music...David Sutton is LXV. He’s from Pennsylvania and I heard his SoundCloud. This was in the earlier days of SoundCloud. I don’t really cruise SoundCloud as much as I did back then. But it was a great place then to hear new stuff and the other day I was even talking about blogs and how it was the only way to hear about new music and then SoundCloud came out and opened this dam of chaos. But yeah, this was just post-blog I would say, but blogs were still relevant at the time as gatekeepers of sonic production in the netherworlds of experientialism. I was really into, hyper into, digital modes of production and also just aesthetics generally and narratives and David was very hardcore at the time. And so we just ended up sharing a few messages and decided to make something and we worked on that record for a year and a half just by proxy. And then we met in New York City. We had a gig at... I can’t think of the name right now. Trans-Pecos. In the basement. James Place was running a series down there.
Cienfuegos and a few others were playing that night. It was a loud show, and yeah, it was a crazy gig because I mean, this person who I made a whole record with I was just meeting with for the first time. We rehearsed somewhere in Bushwick that day and it was a real chaotic... It was a great day actually. And the set was really good, surprisingly. Shawn Reynaldo Did you like each other? Were you worried leading up to it that you were going to meet this guy and he’s going to be a jerk or something? Kara-Lis Coverdale No, I knew he would be fine. Shawn Reynaldo So you’re still friends. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah. Yeah we’re still friends. Shawn Reynaldo All right. Let’s hear something from that record. Again the album is called Sirens. This song is called “Disney.” (music: Kara-Lis Coverdale and LXV – “Disney”)
[applause] That was “Disney,” a collaboration that Kara-Lis did with LXV, and listening to that piece and some of the other music we’ve heard, I feel like there’s this grandiosity to your music in a way, that it just sounds like it’s made for these large, regal spaces and I wanted to ask... You obviously come from this background of playing in churches and playing organ music. Some people call it sacred music. Do you think about place and ideas of space when you’re composing and putting together your music? Kara-Lis Coverdale I think I think about the concert a lot, and just what I would want to hear as someone who is going to listen to music rather than be functional to music. I think about the architecture quite a bit. That kind of comes later though, when I’m deciding what to share in terms of a program for whatever avenue I’m sharing in. But sometimes if I know ahead of time if I’m writing something for a particular event and I know the space, then I might think about it. Shawn Reynaldo Can we pull up image number seven please? This is a photo from a show that happened just a few weeks ago in Montreal, and that is Kara-Lis in the middle of a very large space and you can flip through image eight and nine. Can you tell us a bit about this show and how you prepare for playing in a space like that? Kara-Lis Coverdale This show had a lot of reverb, it was like nine seconds. But a lot of spaces, when you’re playing a power plant or something, for instance, that’s also nine seconds. You have to be a little more patient when you’re sending things through. To be a little Alvin Lucier about it, consider the media’s traveling throughout the box. It’s something to consider for sure, when you’re coming from more controlled, hyper-controlled production environments where the monitors are set exactly at an array of XY and, “No, you gotta have that tweeter up a little higher because...” People can get really crazy about hi-fi and listening playbacks and mixing stuff. But when you go to share it in a live setting you have to learn how to deal with physics on a more immediate level. Shawn Reynaldo That makes me wonder, with your live shows, how improvised is it? I figure when you’re working with these long-form tones and changing reverbs depending on the space, there has to be some level of flexibility to it or maybe there isn’t. You tell me. Kara-Lis Coverdale It really depends. The liveness is, of course, a really age-old concept by now for people who work in... For people who consider recorded media their primary media. I don’t really concern myself with what is liveness. A lot of these works I cannot do them live. I mean live in the sense that each single note is performed out in real time, played by a finger or something. So I just consider playback technologies an extension of my brain at this point, and body. But this show, or the one that was up there, there was 20 minutes of organ improv. There’s ways to have fun in the moment, and there was also a vocalist working with me there. It’s something to keep flexible with, I think, and think of different ways of, I don’t want to say remix because it doesn’t feel right either, re-work the memory. Shawn Reynaldo Clearly, you’re someone who thinks a lot about your music when you’re making it and it seems like there’s a lot of ideas of theory and history and how humans relate to technology going in and I want to show a couple more images. Can you show image number three? Admittedly this is something that I took off of Kara-Lis’ Instagram. And then can we show image number four? Oh, it’s sideways, but it’s some kind of a diagram of a pendulum. I’m just curious, how much of your music is riffing on these ideas, these academic or theoretical constructs, and how much of it is coming from you and just playing what you feel in the moment? Kara-Lis Coverdale I’m pretty addicted to learning, I think. Of course it’s endless in music, whether it’s mathematical or theoretical or whether it’s cultural or whether it’s economical. There’s just... It’s endless, which is great. But I think that I spend about 50% of my time studying and then 50% of my time forgetting what I’ve studied and just exhuming in a way. Because I think if there’s too much of a disconnect between... Of course, purely academic music is very valuable and that it offers this really clear, example-oriented, study-oriented sonic document of an idea or a technique and to be honest, A 480 is kind of like that. It’s pretty nerdy in that regard. Not nerdy but just void of... People still trip to that music, but it's just, in the way that I presented it, it was a little more study-oriented. Shawn Reynaldo Well, I want to play something now from a piece you made called “VoxU.” Why don’t we hear some of it? It’s another very long piece. In fact, you performed it just the other night right here at the Funkhaus before Tim Hecker, and I’ve cut out a couple of excerpts from a very long piece so let’s listen to this and then we’ll get into the ideas behind it. This is again, “VoxU.” (music: Kara-Lis Coverdale – “VoxU”) [applause] Again that was “VoxU.” A piece that you created I think initially for the MUTEK Festival in Montreal, and it has a very specific idea behind it. Maybe you can tell us about that. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, I wanted to explore the origins of vocal synthesis because that’s a pipe organ technology. And so the vox humana, it’s a stop. So a stop, you can think of it as a synthesizer preset. Or like a fixed tone that’s linked to a pipe design. And it’s a reed pipe organ stop that has an oscillating component and then a cylinder which is a tremulant that moves just in front of the blowhole, so it creates this... When it spins and you activate the tremulant it creates that mechanical vibrato that creates those cyclical beats in the music. So, of course, the beats change according to pitch, so there’s only certain pitches that work together so that the beats align in ways that aren’t total deconstructed craziness. So that was fun to figure that out. But I went around I sampled ten different libraries and created ten different libraries from vox humanas and figured out how they work and looked at different instruments and then put it together into this choral work, I guess you could say. Shawn Reynaldo And the vox humana, doesn’t it date back to the 15th century? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yes. Shawn Reynaldo It’s interesting to think people think of synthesis and music technology as these inherently modern pursuits, but I think it’s a recurring theme in your work that you’re interested in the history of music technology, and demonstrating that this stuff goes back way longer than 20 years ago or even 50 years ago. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, for sure. People think of Siri as a new thing but this is like a vowel-oriented Siri, I guess you could say. Shawn Reynaldo So, when you’re doing a piece like this which has a very specific historical inspiration, where are you in a piece like this? How much of this is your personal expression and how much of it is, let’s say, an academic exercise? Kara-Lis Coverdale I think I’m all over it really. Maybe in the arrangement and just the way I write it out I think. Mostly arrangement narrative and my own perspective on the topic is always there. Tends to be kind of dystopic actually. Even though it might be... “VoxU,” I found the technology kind of creepy to be honest. I mean, i’m not the first one to think that. Organists have historically given the boot to the vox hu, you can swap out organ stops quite easily... Not easily but you bring in a technician and they can replace sounds, so if you’re sick of preset four you can just bring in a new one or re-patch it or something, it’s the same idea. But it was laughed at generally, as this odd replacement sound, but I guess maybe that’s why I was drawn to it. [laughs] Shawn Reynaldo You really are an outsider. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah. Shawn Reynaldo It’s interesting you say that, because it’s funny to think about something from the 15th century being designed to replace something that humans were doing, and that story is continued with music technology. You think about the 808 and 909 were supposed to replace drummers and then became this totally separate thing. Do you feel like the history of music technology is something that’s important for understanding music in general? Kara-Lis Coverdale Oh, 100%. I think it’s extremely important. It’s written into music composition, music playing, everything, since day one. You even look at the invention of the pianoforte, for instance, and what the dampener pedal did for music and how that basically gave birth to impressionism. A lot of romantic music, the softening of the palette and what that did for chordal abilities in the left hand, how it freed your hand from the keyboard. Just the advent of a simple dampener pedal. I think its very under-studied, under-considered. Shawn Reynaldo When people talk about your music, I feel like they use a lot of different words because it’s hard to describe. It’s not like, “Oh it’s hip-hop, oh it’s techno.” People say things like experimental or they say sacred music or they say choral music or stuff like that. What I’m wondering is... Or it’s avant-garde. How do you think of your music? Do you even think about in terms of categories? And what’s the appeal of making music in the form that you do, where you’ll make a piece that’s 22 minutes long sometimes? Kara-Lis Coverdale I mean, I don’t really think too much about format or reception. I’m not like, “I’m going to make my trance record now or my...” You know I’m not going to... I mean I respect if someone wants to do that, sure, but I just would rather come across new combinations, in light of what I learned about what everyone else is doing. But I think I’m pretty omnivorous in that sense. I listen to all music and I think that there’s no inherent value, or no primacy and value that are in one music over the other. Shawn Reynaldo I remember one time we spoke before and you said that when you first met Tim Hecker one of the things that you guys bonded over is that you both love Drake. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, it’s true. That was a Canadian connection I guess. Shawn Reynaldo I’m sure there’s some noise people that would really hate to hear something like that, but for you, is it not a different category? Kara-Lis Coverdale I mean, I think that it’s weird when people say they hate a music because then you’re saying you saying hate a whole group of people. And I just think that’s really violent. I don’t know. Shawn Reynaldo Speaking of not adhering to the rules, I want to play something that you put out last year and it’s called Grafts, and it was essentially a 22-plus-minute piece that came out, and even that is an interesting act in and of itself, being that long. Let’s hear a little bit. Again, I’ve excerpted a few pieces because we can’t play all 22 minutes, so let’s hear a little bit of it and then we’ll talk about it. (music: Kara-Lis Coverdale – Grafts)
[applause] That was Grafts, it came out last year on Boomkat. Oddly enough, even though it was this 22-minute piece, I would say it was your most critically acclaimed thing that you have put out to date, and it got accolades from even a lot of the DJ world and stuff like that. And then the record came out and you didn’t really talk that much about it, there wasn’t a lot of interviews. I feel like people don’t really know that much about this record. So can you tell us what was the inspiration behind “Grafts?” Kara-Lis Coverdale Grafts was something I wasn’t really expecting a lot of people to listen to I guess. Shlom from Boomkat wrote me and asked if I would like to do a one-sided LP as part of a special series Boomkat was doing. And I’m a really big fan of Boomkat so I decided yes, and I had this piece that I had made four months prior, a rough cut at the time. But it came from... I guess it was a really personal piece of music but, yeah, then it came out and people were listening to it, it was a strange phenomena. Shawn Reynaldo Is the fact that it was a personal record, is that what contributed to you not really doing a lot of press around it? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, I didn’t think that... I don’t know. Shawn Reynaldo You don’t have to tell us now, you can keep the secret if you like. Kara-Lis Coverdale Not necessarily, it’s just that the way that it was part of a series. It wasn’t a proper album per se. It was a one-sided LP, it was only 22 minutes of music and kind of three pieces, it came out of me sitting down for 8 hours straight and that was it, that was the music. A really late night thing. I often work on nocturnal songs, and it came out of one session, even though I worked on it a long time after fine tuning it. Shawn Reynaldo One thing I wanted to ask about, sort of related to not doing the normal press cycle is that you’re an artist, you don’t do traditional releases, you don’t conform to traditional genre barriers but you seem to be constantly touring and playing around the world at festivals. You have lots of commissioned pieces that different cultural institutions ask you to do. Sometimes, when you put out a record, you talk about it in the press, sometimes you don’t, but you don’t really seem that concerned with the usual cycle of the music industry, but you’re still finding a niche. Is that something that you’re consciously pursuing, to try and stay out of that cyclical, album cycle rat-race that a lot of artists seem to be stuck in? Kara-Lis Coverdale I just feel that it’s really difficult to stick with something, in terms of... The press is so slow to catch up with what I’m doing and then I feel like it’s so much work to be updating all the time, and I’d rather just be making music. But it’s something I think you have to get a hold of, and learn how to deal with, the media also. You have to get used to the multiple interpretations of your word and how common discourse can inflect or paint over your own experience in ways. I just feel like for a few years there it was a constant battle with the media and it was exhausting so I was like, “Forget it,” at a certain point. But that was a few years ago now, so I’m ready, I think, to re-approach that. Shawn Reynaldo And what about with shows? Because it’s not like the new Kara-lis Coverdale record comes out and then it’s like, “Oh it’s time for my European tour and that will be followed by my American tour and it’s all very structured and there’s a social media campaign that ties into it.” Yet, at the same time you’re always traveling and I’ll see, oh, you have a residency at this place in Europe or this place in Canada or wherever. How does it work with your live shows and planning that as a part of your career? Kara-Lis Coverdale It’s been kind of a wild ride in the past while I guess. Like you said, it’s been a lot of different projects and a lot of different ideas and a lot of different everything. For a while my first huge tour, I was basically touring for two years and then I would find myself doing Elbphilharmonie one night in Hamburg, that beautiful new concert space. And then I would be doing Venster99 the next night, an anarchist pub in Vienna. It was really weird, up and down. But I think that’s just... It’s not an uncommon experience, I think, with musicians, but maybe it was a little more extreme in my case because I also don’t... I’ve been very resistant to having a manager and anything like that, and I like to do my own thing and make my own decisions. So if something interests me I just do it. Whether or not that’s a bad business decision I don’t know. It definitely made me very exhausted, so we’ll see for the next few years how it goes. Shawn Reynaldo Were going to open it up to questions pretty soon but I wanted to end by playing something new that you’ve brought in. Can you tell us about this piece? This is something that has not been released. Kara-Lis Coverdale I wrote this in Paris, and I was coming off of a residency, sort of out of a residency with GRM. They’ve been very kind to me, and I don’t really need to say much else. Shawn Reynaldo Alright. Does it have a title? Kara-Lis Coverdale It’s called “Flu glac_ru” right now but I code all my stuff in really weird ways so it’ll probably be called something else, or not, I don’t know. Shawn Reynaldo Alright, well let’s give it a listen. (music: Kara-Lis Coverdale – “Flu glac ru”) That was “Flu glac_ru,” maybe it’ll change, the title, at some point. Unreleased music from Kara-Lis Coverdale. I want to ask one last thing before we open it up to the audience. When you’re composing, there’s a lot of different sounds on there, we’ve heard a lot of different music. Sometimes there’s vocal bits, sometimes there’s piano, sometimes there’s organ, sometimes there’s something that’s entirely electronic. Where do you begin? What is your home sound or instrument? Is it on the computer? Is it on a piano? Is it on an organ? Is it something else entirely? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, either percussion or wind, for sure. Never really strings. Usually percussion or wind. Shawn Reynaldo It’s interesting you say percussion, just because there’s not a lot of drums. Kara-Lis Coverdale Well, piano is a percussion instrument. Shawn Reynaldo Well, now you’re out-nerding me on music. Fair enough. All right. Well, let’s have a hand for Kara-Lis Coverdale. [applause] Kara-Lis Coverdale Thanks. Shawn Reynaldo If anyone in the audience has questions, they’ll come to you with the microphone. Audience Member Hi. Kara-Lis Coverdale Ciao. Audience Member Ciao. When you’re looking for vocalists, or searching for vocalists that are going to be in your works, what characteristics do you look for in their voice, in their opinions towards music and how they work and what works they’ve chosen to be in? What do you look for? You know? Kara-Lis Coverdale I don’t look for a characteristic in the voice, that’s for sure. I think I look for some other type of resonance. It’s like a vibe you feel out. Most people I work with, there’s some connection, if you know what I mean. Audience Member Before you hear them sing, ever? Or is that after you’ve seen them perform or something? Kara-Lis Coverdale It can be either before or after. But it’s usually on a human level, or on a level of just a shared vision of something, or a shared... You’ve gone deep in something, maybe separately, but you’ve both gone deep to that place and you can just feel that you’ve both been there. That kind of a connection. But that said, it doesn’t necessarily need to exist. Like with the Estonian work, with those singers, that was very, “Hi.” I met them on that day and it worked out really nicely, so it’s not necessary. But long-term collaborations are usually a little more human-oriented. Audience Member Have you heard the album Ramona Lisa by Caroline Polachek? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yes. Audience Member Hi, I’m Philip, big fan of Grafts. It was one of my favorite things in 2017. I’m sad that I missed the show in Cologne, and I wanted to ask two things, sort of about the structuring of the record, Grafts, because for me it’s really... It’s interesting in a way that it sort of hangs in the air. It has this serene calmness to it, but then there’s this perfect spot where the piece transitions into the next, but it sort of doesn’t. It feels inherently right and I wanted to ask you how you achieved that, because it’s hard for me to put it into words. Kara-Lis Coverdale I think that just comes out of a form of... Just years of thinking and playing at the same time. It’s like playing is a form of speaking, because a lot of that work was just one take, like I said.
There was three layerings that I re-went over. But it was more or less immediate. So those transitions are just me talking from one sentence to the next. It’s very real-time. It’s not me going through and deciding I want two-seven to go to six and then six to go to one and I need a cadence there before... You know? It’s just comes out. Audience Member So it’s more like... Kara-Lis Coverdale That’s a really bad answer. Audience Member It’s like an in the moment thing you would say? Kara-Lis Coverdale In Grafts, because it was such a letting, I guess you could say, more than something I was architecting for the sake of whatever. Some other external... I guess commission is the word. It was more of my own thing. Yeah, I guess it’s a real-time. Yeah. Difficult to place how that works. Audience Member Thank you. Kara-Lis Coverdale It’s a magical, musical thing. Audience Member My second question would be... I’m sorry if I’m taking too long. On Grafts, and on the new piece you played, I’ve heard you incorporating just playing pure scales up and down. Like, for example, I think in Grafts it’s in the third half, it’s like a pentatonic scale going up. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, Grafts is very modal. Audience Member Yeah, that’s what I was interested in, because I wanted to ask you if your interest in utilizing music technology and showing the bare-bones structures of it and taking these bits also applies to musical theory structures, because I feel like you’re using scales in a way that’s... Uses the scale as a whole, as an object, instead of just working in the frame of a specific mode or scale, which is very interesting to me. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, absolutely. Some scales fit different instruments better. You really have to adapt immediately to whatever instrument you’re using. It’s like being conversational with people in that regard, when you have to, “Oh, maybe this person can’t handle this right now, so I’m just going to close this other area of me.” I don’t know. Just being accommodating. That’s something I learned pretty early, I think, as a pianist. Also, for going to competition, for instance, you’re expected to show up and perform a really technically precise work on this new piano for the first time that is totally different than whatever you’ve worked on before, whereas a violinist shows up and just shreds on their own violin. But yeah, when you’re composing you have to consider the instrumental bias, always. And with organs, they’re all very different also. It’s a good gateway to get into that world of individuality. Audience Member Thank you. Audience Member Hi. I’m Mira. Kara-Lis Coverdale Hi Mira. Audience Member Thank you so much. Kara-Lis Coverdale Thank you. Audience Member Really inspiring. I was wondering how you... When you work with writing down the music and the scores within, like the first one with the circle thing, do your ideas come from the score sometimes, or do you write them down afterwards just to show it to people? Or do you write them down for yourself? How does that thing work for you? Kara-Lis Coverdale I have a really weird relationship with scores. I kind of hate them, but I love them. Like with these A 480 scores, I wrote them after I made the music. I rarely write music on the score first, almost never. So in that sense, I’m very much a child of playback, in the same way that composition was very contested in the keyboard era. Musics that were written at the keyboard, it was considered a crutch that you shouldn’t really rely on. You should just have your quill and write out your phrases and it’s more theoretically pure or whatever. But I’m the naughty version of our time, where I like to rely on input technologies, and then if I need to write it down after I’ll transcribe it out of that. But I think it makes for much more immediate music. But also I like to, on my albums at least, do back and forth procedures, so you’re writing a bit in more innovative ways, and then there’s also just moments of outpouring. I think it’s a little more like you grow further when you take a step back and write things down in the score, kind of mentality. Does that make sense? Audience Member Yeah. Is it mostly for yourself that you do it? Or is it for other people to understand it in a new way? Kara-Lis Coverdale No, I never do it for myself. It’s always for other people. Shawn Reynaldo Speaking of scores, there was an image I didn’t get to show today, but maybe we can pull it up. It’s, I believe image number five. Oh, it’s sideways. But anyways, you can see there’s a more traditional score or note thing happening at the top, then these circles... this is another image that I pulled off of Kara-Lis’s Instagram. I definitely did some deep lurking before today’s talk.
Can you explain what’s going on here? Kara-Lis Coverdale There’s some medieval notation going on at the top, but then I’ve also decimalized it because I like doing those conversions. I’m really obsessed with converting numeral values into ratios that are digitally compatible. And then 16, 32, just classic value sequences, that also mirror digital and pipe organ technologies, I really like that overlay. I’m constantly working with that in my music.
And my mother was a draftsperson, so I really like rulers and protractors. It’s also a nice way to illustrate ratio-based harmony, like, from Harry Partch’s work. I don’t know if anyone here knows that. But, yeah, this was just an exercise in ratios. Shawn Reynaldo No more questions from me. Anyone else from the crowd? Audience Member I have the microphone, sorry. Hello. Kara-Lis Coverdale Hi. Audience Member I have a very practical question, actually. You said you travel around a lot and you go from different projects to others, so change the scenery or maybe also the bubble. How do you organize your ideas or inspirations that come along? Do you actually do that? Or do you just work? Actually, it’s kind of related to what she asked also. Yeah, do you collect ideas, inspirations...? Kara-Lis Coverdale I literally spit it out on the go. Like, if something comes I’m like, “Oh, I’ll just put that there.” And then it goes out immediately. Maybe that’s why I’m so addicted to producing in the immediate sense rather than on larger projects. Then, I guess in terms of organizing it’s just a lot of emails and writing in my... I have a black book. And my computer. Yeah. Audience Member Hi. Kara-Lis Coverdale Hi. Audience Member I’m Susana. Kara-Lis Coverdale Hi. Audience Member Thank you so much for your talk. You said that you are no longer using SoundCloud to listen to new music. Kara-Lis Coverdale How long? Oh, I don’t know. Audience Member No, SoundCloud. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yes. What about it? Audience Member I was wondering where are you lately looking for some music on the internet nowadays? Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, I’ve gone pretty private, so I guess emails. I also like to meet people in real life now. I’m pretty adamant about that. Although there’s a few things I have going on where I knew about some music before, just through usually word of mouth or a friend of a friend or someone introduces themselves. People send me music all the time and I check it out. Yeah. I just don’t spend much time surfing SoundCloud as I used to, for better or worse. Audience Member Thanks. Kara-Lis Coverdale Hello. Audience Member Hi. Yeah, thanks for your talk. I’m Tornike. My question was regarding when you do a piece inspired by folk chant or choir or any other choir or sacred music which is pretty canonic and has a lot of history to it, do you feel a responsibility to take it... When you make it your own thing, do you feel responsible for taking it somewhere else? How does it feel? Is it like a pressure in a way? Kara-Lis Coverdale That’s a really good question. This is a very delicate dance, because there is really a lot of weight there, and you have to be respectful. Absolutely. There’s been times where I’ve felt it’s been really necessary to be a little more radical. But I always have good reason, and I make sure that I can face-to-face say it to somebody who is informed about those traditions and cares about them. It’s not something I would do for LOLs, ever. Also, when you’re an organist, you’re vetted for each space you perform in, so there’s usually resumes involved. These are really precious instruments. So there’s a certain degree of respect that always has to follow everything you do. In terms of the works themselves, for instance, the gagaku, this is the most immediate example I can think of, the gagaku ensemble I was performing with as part of the [Tim Hecker] Konoyo tour. These musics are sacred musics that are meant to usher their afterlife sonics. The show, for instance, is a mouth organ that’s made by instrument masters that source these pieces of bamboo from the bamboo forest and spend months making these instruments. The sonic is meant to open the gateway between this world and the next world. And when we were performing the work in Tokyo, this amazing sound engineer, he’s just such a cool guy, Zach, I don’t even know his last name, but he came up after and he was like, “Oh, very intense.” And then when I started talking to him a bit more he got into how he was hesitant to even help us with the performance in the first... Not help us, but he needed to check out what we were doing with the gagaku, because it is such a special... You don’t mess with it really. Then, after he said, like, “I knew that it was the right... I was able to participate after I saw how you were working together.” Yeah, these are serious traditions and they’re serious practices. I mean, you’re talking about the ritual of life and death often. It’s not something you joke around about. [laughs] Audience Member Thanks. Shawn Reynaldo When you were working on the Estonian project that we heard, did you have to worry about appropriating your own heritage in a way? It’s weird to think about that, because you are Estonian, but at the same time you’re sort of an outsider to that culture. Kara-Lis Coverdale Oh, for sure. I think about this all the time, it’s so trippy. Because the music that my grandparents brought to Canada is very much music of that time, which was another reason why I insisted that they bring me there to work on it, because I felt like my idea of being an Estonian was 50 years old. Then I’d be reinterpreting an interpretation of an interpretation of an interpretation. But in terms of appropriating, no. I don’t think I was appropriating, because I’ve been a participant and I was invited, and we worked together, literally on the whole thing. Appropriation would just be taking without having any business doing so. So, yeah, even when I’m traveling I don’t go anywhere I’m not invited. There’s simple procedures of what is appropriate and not. I guess appropriate is part of appropriation, and that’s probably... Shawn Reynaldo Someone has to email you first? Kara-Lis Coverdale No, I can reach out first. But, yeah. Shawn Reynaldo Does anyone else have any questions? Audience Member Hi. Joan. Kara-Lis Coverdale Hi, Joan. Audience Member I have the impression that you read a lot of music theory books from your Instagram stories. Which one is your favorite one, or the latest one you’ve read? Kara-Lis Coverdale Lately, I’ve been into [Hermann von] Helmholtz on the sensation of tone again, I’ve been revisiting. Harry Partch, also been revisiting. I really like reading [Arnold] Schoenberg, [Karlheinz] Stockhausen is always inspiring, in his weird ways. Then, I really like the more creative radicals. I read a lot of Glenn Gould, across the board. Even though it’s not really theoretical per se, but I think he’s someone who really, in an interesting way, imbues his own personality with theoretical inquiry in a way that resonates with me. I read about architecture a lot. There’s The Soundscape of Modernity by Emily Thompson, it's excellent. She talks about how architecture can form ideas about modern sonic production. That ties into organ work also. Jonathan Sterne is a favorite theorist. That’s more philosophical, that’s history of technology, but that text has really changed my life. He’s a very generous and interesting scholar, also he works in Montreal.
Yeah, those are some immediate examples. Audience Member OK, thank you. Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, no problem. Shawn Reynaldo Last chance. Audience Member Hi again. As you just mentioned architecture, I was wondering how do you think about form in your music? Do you take inspiration from other fields, or maybe... Kara-Lis Coverdale Yeah, form is such an interesting topic, especially in digital music, because you’re rendering objects so often. So I feel like you can talk about... I mean, form historically in music is talked about on this horizontal left/right trajectory in terms of arrangement of event. But now you can talk about form as being a point A to B, like in a distance-related orientation as well, and a 360 orientation, but in a finite space that isn’t necessarily moving left to right. Yeah, it’s a really exciting time to talk about that. But in terms of architecture, yeah, of course. I like to think often about the relationship between an instrument and the period in which the buildings, like this building for instance, the Nils Frahm studio definitely fits this, this architecture, you know, it’s like they’re made to be together or something. What kind of architecture would fit my music? I don’t know. I think about goo a lot, and wood, also. But form is also a textural thing as much as it is a sequencing event. I think for modern producers, textures, like fabrics and that kind of stuff, can be really interesting to think about. Shawn Reynaldo Anyone else? All right. Well... Kara-Lis Coverdale Thanks. Shawn Reynaldo Thank you so much to Kara-Lis Coverdale. [applause]

Title: Larry Gold

Larry Gold
A classically trained prodigy who began playing the cello at age seven, Philadelphia native Larry Gold has worked on countless hit records over the past four decades. Throughout the ’60s, ’70s and early ’80s he was a member of MFSB, the legendary house band for Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff’s Philadelphia International Records, and helped shape “The Sound of Philadelphia,” as it came to be known, via classic recordings by the O’Jays, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, Teddy Pendergrass, Billy Paul and others. By the late ’90s, Gold came into his own as the go-to string arranger of the modern R&B and hip-hop era. His orchestral contributions to Brandy & Monica’s 1998 smash “The Boy Is Mine” set off a series of genre-defining recordings, including classics by the Roots, Erykah Badu, Jay-Z, Justin Timberlake, Jill Scott, Common and Kanye West.
In his lecture at RBMA Berlin 2018, Larry Gold discussed learning and making music in Philadelphia, the Philly sound, creating emotional depth with string arrangements and his composition process.
Hosted by Jeff Mao Our guest today is a musician, studio owner, producer and, of course, a great string arranger. Won’t you please welcome Mr. Larry Gold? [applause] Thanks so much for being here. Larry Gold It’s great. Jeff Mao This was kind of impromptu, you with the cello, here this morning. This is kinda what you do every morning, though. Right? Larry Gold I do. I play all day when I’m not working on someone’s arrangement. Music is my daily bread. Jeff Mao How many hours a day do you practice? Larry Gold I’d say, minimally two, but maybe eight at times. There was a period of about 20, 25 years when I didn’t play my cello. I used to play on records, obviously, and I kept myself in great shape. But then when I opened The Studio, which I think is about 25 years ago, and I started doing arranging, a couple of arrangements every week, I really didn’t have the time to devote to the cello. So every time I went to play it, I felt like I was a stranger to it. That feeling made me pretty depressed. So I sort of put it aside for a while. I mean, I would pick it up. I picked it up, I told you before, when The Roots entered my life, for a while. I went up and I would take it out every once in a while, because they would like me to take it out. So I mean, I did some live performing on occasion. Jeff Mao Right, right. Larry Gold With Jay-Z. Jeff Mao Right, exactly. We’ll get to some of these things, these notable events in your career. I wanted to start, actually, with a piece of music that we talked about a little bit. Now, this is an arrangement of yours for an artist named Jill Scott. And... Larry Gold This record was completely done at my studio. Jeff Mao In your studio. Larry Gold Yeah. Jeff Mao OK. The 2011 record that we’re about to play? Larry Gold Yes, yes. Jeff Mao OK. So just to sort of reset, even though we have Larry playing a little bit this morning, let’s hear something that he arranged for Jill Scott. The track is called “Hear My Call.” It’s from 2011. And let’s give it a listen. (music: Jill Scott – “Hear My Call” / applause) Jeff Mao That was Jill Scott, “Hear My Call,” 2011, produced by JR Hutson and string arrangements by Larry Gold. We wanted to play this song because the elements are so sparse. It’s really just piano, voice and the strings. And as an example of what you do, I guess, tell us about your approach to a piece like this. Larry Gold Well, strings are emotional. And this was a very emotional song, and I thought it was a good way to start. I love Jill. All I can tell you is that the song still moves me, to this day. And I’ve heard it a lot in my lifetime. It’s something I actually... I like it. Ask me a question about it, and I can maybe better answer it. You know, I do everything by feeling, more than by rote. And Jill was in the studio recording, and I have a little room off to the side. And I was working on the arrangement, and she would knock on the door and say, “How’s it going?” And I’d say, “It’s goin’,” and I wouldn’t play it for her. And then I finally played it for her and she was crying. And I said, “Well, let’s do it.” And that was the end of it. And then she performed it a lot. One time, she asked me to fly to California to conduct and I said, “You don’t need a conductor. It’s only a string quartet.” She said, “I want you to fly,” and I don’t like flying, even though I flew to Germany, for this. And so I didn’t fly. And I don’t remember where – it was for some big event out in California, but she’s used it... On a lot of occasions, she’s used it when she wants to be more intimate. Jeff Mao Yeah. This song is such an expression of vulnerability. When you get a client, obviously this is an artist that you worked closely with for a number of years, so it’s a different type of relationship. Larry Gold Oh, I’ve known Jill since she was in high school. Jeff Mao Yeah. Larry Gold She grew up in Philadelphia. One of the things about me being in Philadelphia is that a lot of the artists that you’re gonna play today all grew up in Philadelphia. So we were sort of a homegrown unit of musicians. Jeff Mao You said it’s all sort of by feel, but when you’re writing the arrangement, something like this, you notice just as a neophyte, as a lay person, who doesn’t study music necessarily formally, you hear just the strings follow the cadence of her singing at different points, whatever countermelodies that you’re sort of exploring. I guess, does that apply in this type of situation, or is it really just something that’s more instinctive? Larry Gold This was more instinctive. I just wanted to add an emotional context to the song, and this was an easy song to do, even though it took me a minute to come to terms with it. I don’t like doing too much, because I think too much takes... You can go hear a symphony, or go listen to the cello or something. And it’s a pop record, really. So I don’t know, I just think the mood is good. Jeff Mao Where in Philly did you grow up? Larry Gold I grew up in a neighborhood that was pretty poor. It’s called North Philadelphia. Same neighborhood Jill grew up. The same neighborhood McFadden & Whitehead grew up. The same neighborhood Teddy Pendergrass grew up. A lot of musicians, a lot of singers. My father had a store, we lived up top of the store. In the back of the store, I used to play my cello all day long. Jeff Mao At what age did you start on the cello? Larry Gold Six. I started guitar, first. There was a toy guitar in my father’s store. And I brought it in the back, I learned how to tune it. It was actually an Elvis Presley guitar, which I should’ve kept, because it’s worth a lot of money today. It was one of those little toy plastic guitars. And it came with a pitch [tuning] fork and it came with a little color instruction book, “How to Tune the Guitar.” And it actually had ... What? It had a couple of songs in the back, and I taught myself how to play a few Elvis songs. And my mother took me to guitar lessons. Two blocks away or three blocks away there was a little music store, in the early ‘50s. And the guitar teacher, after going through a few books with me, said, “You gotta get him a violin. He’s got hands. He’s got fingers. He’s got ears.” Jeff Mao Yeah. Larry Gold So my mother went to school, and I was too young, really, to get an instrument, but they took me in this room and I’m small, I’m petite. I’m not a big – Jeff Mao Petite’s a good word, yeah. Larry Gold OK. I’m not a big man. So if they would’ve had a bass in that room, I would’ve taken the bass, but the biggest string instrument they had in that room was the cello. So I came home, the cello was bigger than I was at the time. And that’s all. Jeff Mao And you stuck with this, and eventually were classically trained. You got into a pretty prestigious music school. Correct? Larry Gold I went to conservatory, yeah. Jeff Mao Right. Which one was that? Larry Gold Curtis [Institute of Music]. There’s a great music school in Philadelphia. And I got in very young. I started studying with the cello teacher there, and I started studying with the counterpoint teacher there. And I was accepted, I think I was around 13 years old. I sort of stopped going to high school. I don’t recommend it, but – Jeff Mao I think some people in this room are already past that point, so you’re in good company, actually. Larry Gold Yeah, I know. But I don’t recommend stopping learning, that’s what I mean. Jeff Mao But in terms of actually stopping school, why did you quit school? Larry Gold Because I fell in love with music, and I knew music was going to be my life, and I always liked to read, anyway. And I figured I knew enough math. I was a little big shot. I don’t know what to tell you. You know? And I started playing. So I was playing around town, just like I played here, and somebody asked for my phone number. And the somebody that asked for my phone number was the contractor who contracted all the musicians in Philadelphia for the records. And in the early ‘60s in Philadelphia, there were some big records being made. There was Cameo and Parkway, and as you told me... What is it? Jeff Mao Arctic, yeah. Larry Gold Arctic and there were a few other record labels that I’m not gonna remember the name, per se. But I started playing on records. And I fell in love with the process of making records. Jeff Mao Right. Larry Gold And singing and all that kind of stuff. Jeff Mao So you were already in love with pop music, though. Larry Gold Completely. I told you, I’d learned Elvis Presley songs when I was six years old, so yeah, I was very fond. My mother used to say that with the guitar and me singing, I could’ve earned a living at any bar in that neighborhood. Just going to play, and people would’ve thrown money at me. Jeff Mao And what was the name of the contractor who picked you out of the crowd? Larry Gold His name was Don Renaldo. You don’t see credits much on records anymore, but if you go back to the ‘60s and the ‘70s, on the back of every record out of Philadelphia, it said Don Renaldo, strings and horns. Jeff Mao Yeah. Larry Gold And I was part of that strings and horns. And that strings and horns eventually became a group called MFSB. Jeff Mao How many pieces are composed in that string section back then? Larry Gold Six violins, two violas, two cellos. And then a full complement of horns, too. Jeff Mao And what kind of musicians were converging to work together on... Larry Gold All different kinds. Some of them were conservatory trained, some were jazz players. It was a combination of people. Most of them were formally trained classically, though. Jeff Mao On the string side, you mean? Larry Gold On the string side. Jeff Mao And then on the other side was mostly jazz players? Larry Gold They were formally trained. Everybody’s formally trained a little bit, but yeah, they were all jazz players. Jeff Mao Yeah. I know you’ve said before that you kind of learned pop music from an African American perspective, because you’re working on black music, essentially. Larry Gold Philadelphia’s a black town. They didn’t make white records. They did, Cameo and Parkway made some records. Jeff Mao A little bit though, right? Yeah. Larry Gold Yes, they did. But I wasn’t included. That was Bobby Rydell and people like that. I never cared for that end of it. I think my mother grew up listening to things that I never really identified with. A little bit I did, but not that much. I identified much more with the early records that I was listening to. I mean, like I told you, Stax/Volt, and the Motown records I loved. Then the opportunity in Philadelphia was for me to participate on these R&B records. So I got into it. I learned. They taught me gospel music. They taught me everything. Jeff Mao So this is black and white musicians. You told me that there was a union for the black musicians and one separate for the white musicians. Correct? Larry Gold In the early ‘60s, that’s correct. That’s how segregated life was in Philadelphia. It’s still too segregated, in a way, but there’s not a black and a white musician union anymore. Jeff Mao So you’re in the studio together with people from maybe a different neighborhood or that you haven’t necessarily encountered as a teenager. What else did you learn? Not just musically, but just from being around this crew of people? Larry Gold Well, they were less formal than my background was. And I liked that a lot. I learned how to smoke reefer with them. I mean, there were so many things that I learned that I can’t put in words. I just liked them. They liked me, and I liked them. They liked me for my knowledge, and I liked them for their knowledge. Jeff Mao When did you start to encounter producers like Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff? Larry Gold I was probably a teenager. I would say [I was] maybe 16, 17 years old the first time I saw Leon Huff. He was in the record business early on. He did Phil Spector’s records. He played piano on all those great Phil Spector records out of New York, and the girl groups and all that. They used to have four piano players, three piano players in the room at one time. And Leon was one of the piano players. Leon played rhythm piano. Then there was somebody who played melodic and so ... But I met him then, and I met Bunny Sigler then. Bunny Sigler used to sing opera, so he considered himself like a crossover. He was classical as well as R&B. I mean, I got very involved. First of all, it was the way I made my living, too. It wasn’t as if I did it for nothing. Those early records... First of all, it was all cash. There was no checks. It was really sort of, not lawful, I guess is the best way to say it. Jeff Mao Off the books. Larry Gold Say again? Jeff Mao Off the books. Larry Gold Off the books, yeah. Jeff Mao Actually, there’s one group that you did form, which I actually am a little bit curious about, before you got fully immersed into the soul scene. Larry Gold Well, it was both. But I’m- Jeff Mao It was at the same time. Simultaneous. Larry Gold At the same time. Jeff Mao OK. Larry Gold I had a bar band before this group. Jeff Mao Right. Larry Gold And my bar band used to do covers. I played bass. Electric bass. And my bar band used to do covers, but we mostly did Sam & Dave and we did Percy Sledge. We did whatever we felt like doing, but we weren’t the only... We were in Philadelphia doing that, but I think there’s probably a band in every city in the ‘60s, in every city we would go to that were doing that. Jeff Mao Right. If we can show image number one on the screen over here. How did this group form? Good News. Larry Gold Oh, Michael Bacon, who still plays music, and I had been friends since we were 11 years old. Michael played the cello. And I met him, we were both cellists in an all-city orchestra. And we were friends for years and years and years. And I think, as I told you yesterday, and I’ll tell everybody here, I took way too many psychedelics. And I ended up not even knowing my name, which is not good. But this group was sort of like a healing process for me. I went away from my earlier friends and I did this. I didn’t write most of this stuff, but I played and I sang a little bit, and we went all over the world. We did the Isle of Wight Festival. It got very successful very quickly. We were signed at Columbia Records. I hated the record we made. I knew I didn’t know anything about making records when we were in the studio making that record. They gave us a producer and all he did was, he... Whatever we did live, we did in the studio. And I knew that wasn’t right. And I knew none of the songs would be hits, because they didn’t sound like the other records that were on the radio at the time. Jeff Mao Well, what style are we talking about? Larry Gold It was folk music, I would say. I would classify it as more... It was acoustic guitar and the cello. And I played bass, too. And we both sang, and that was it. And we made a lot of noise. I play a lot of cello, so I ate up a lot of space with the cello. And Michael had a good voice. Michael sounded a lot like James Taylor. To this day, he has a band with his brother Kevin Bacon, who’s world-famous, called the Bacon Brothers. And I don’t go hear them, because I don’t like ‘em. So I don’t know what to tell ya. [audience laughter] Jeff Mao Sorry, Kevin. Yeah. Larry Gold Yeah. Sorry, Kevin. But if they were in the room, I’d say the same thing. Jeff Mao Yeah. I think it’s also interesting because you’re relatively young, and you’re getting this major record deal. As a young person, sort of dealing with... The music industry is different now, but that same experience might be something that people in this room encounter, in terms of being involved in something from a relatively early age that they’re not ready for. What do you think you can sort of impart as far as advice goes in dealing with a situation like that? Larry Gold Well, I never listened to anybody. Like I said before, I quit school early. I thought I was like a street kid, on my own in the ‘60s. And I’m not recommending that. This group had an agent, and a lawyer, had a manager, had all these people that told me what to do. It drove me crazy. And at the end of the week, if we made couple thousand dollars, I’d go home with $200 or whatever it was. I don’t even remember what it was. And I hated that. I hated that because it was just, I know they made a living. And to this day, I have a manager who got me this gig. So I mean, it’s part of reality. Jeff Mao I thought I got you this gig. [laughs] Larry Gold And a lot of times, when you’re little, you don’t think they know what they’re talking about. You’re like, “Oh, I know what I’m doing.” And especially if you were a hippie and involved in drugs, for sure, you didn’t listen to anybody. The hippies had an expression: Don’t trust anybody over 30. You know? So here I was, all of 16 to 17 years old, and all these... I had a manager who was probably in his 50s. It was not a good experience. I met Clive Davis and I met a lot of different people, a lot of different artists that I admired. My goal before this record... They kept on saying, “Oh, this is the next Simon & Garfunkel.” CBS signed us, “Oh, Columbia. Oh, this is the next ... “ So I said, “Oh, great. Well, why don’t you get Paul Simon to produce the record, then?” So we actually had a meeting with him, but he didn’t even produce his own records. Jeff Mao Well, the producers who made a profound impact on you after you left this group, as we mentioned, Kenneth Gamble, Leon Huff. If we could show image number two. [picture appears on screen] Larry Gold Well, the thing was, I had already had a taste of what the Philly records were prior to this. So when I gave this up, I knew I could go back there. I called Don Renaldo. I said, “Look, could I play cello again in your group?” And he said, “Absolutely. Are you kidding?” So I started working right away. And I also knew that Gamble and Huff and Tommy Bell, these guys knew how to make records, man. Jeff Mao And that’s Thom Bell in the center, right there. Leon on the left and Kenneth on the right. Larry Gold That’s a great picture. That’s when we were kids. Jeff Mao So you’re going and doing sessions. Let’s play something, actually, that I believe you played on. It’ll sound really nice in this room. This is the O’Jays “Back Stabbers” from 1972. Larry Gold Leon Huff playing piano. Jeff Mao Leon Huff playing piano. You’re a part of the string section, arranged by Thom Bell. Produced by Gamble and Huff. (music: The O’Jays – “Back Stabbers” / applause) Larry Gold That’s the mighty O’Jays. Let me tell ya, man. They’re still kickin’. I’m gonna do an album with them before the end of the year. Might be their last album. You don’t have a picture. Eddie Levert, he’s gotta be 78 years old, now. And Walter’s gotta be in that general [range]. I’m 70, and they’re eight to ten years older than I am. Jeff Mao Do you have a memory of... Larry Gold I have a memory of the song. Because the person who actually wrote the lyrics for that song was my good friend John Whitehead, who’s not with us anymore. And he told me that he was living in what we called government housing... You call government housing, maybe, but we called the projects, in Philadelphia. And he came home one day, and his wife, young wife, was outside talking to these two guys, and he went upstairs, and he got really mad. He went out... And they’d smile at him. And he went upstairs and he wrote, “They smile in my face all the time they wanna take your place, the back stabbers.” And he wasn’t working for Gamble and Huff at the time, but Gamble and Huff had a little office in those days. And he went in and he sang... This is the way he wrote a song. He would go, “They’re smilin’ in you ... “ He would come in and just sing the melody to you. And he sang the melody to Huff, and Huff started playing the piano, and it turned out to be a big hit. And it turned out to be a career-maker for my friends John and Gene. And that’s the story I have about that. Jeff Mao When you’re going to work everyday, you’re going to Sigma Sound Studios in Philly, right? And you are a part of these sessions. I mean, we could literally sit here for hours listening to different Philadelphia soul records that you were in on sessions for. Did you have an idea, at the time, that this was something really special? Larry Gold I knew that was a hit. If you know the history of Motown and the history of commercial black music, this sounds like a hit. And I would go in and sometimes I would get the chills. I would just sit there, and listening back to... Before we even put the strings or the horns on, I would just sit there and think about just how brilliant the vocals were, and how brilliant the rhythm was. I mean, that’s Norman Harris playing guitar, who’s no longer with us, who was my dear friend. I mean, these were great musicians. Jeff Mao What about the arrangement of Thom Bell? I mean, you can either use this as an example or... Larry Gold You know what? You can barely hear the strings. Jeff Mao Well, I think when you hear the strings, though, it’s this wave of something. Larry Gold Thom Bell was the... I used to say he was the black Burt Bacharach. He was the greatest young black arranger in the country at the time. And Atlantic Records knew it, as well as Columbia Records knew it. And they gave these guys carte blanche. In those days, these were street kids. They gave them whatever they wanted. They knew that they had something special in Philadelphia. Jeff Mao OK, so you mentioned Norman Harris. Larry Gold Ronnie Baker. Jeff Mao Ronnie Baker, Earl Young. These are some of the... Really the rhythm section, the backbone of a lot of these records. Larry Gold The backbone of these records. These guys came to work and enjoyed themselves. They smoked a reefer and they played on their song. That was what they did. Jeff Mao How many songs in a day would you typically do? Larry Gold As a rhythm section, I bet they did at least three, four. Tommy Bell would do even five or six a day. But it’d go a late day. It was all based on what you heard the piano do. In Tommy Bell’s songs, he was the leader. He sat there and the guitar fit in and the bass fit in and the drums fit in. And they kept going and going and going; and Gamble would be in the booth and Gamble had the words, or whoever was the lyricist would... And the vocalists were never there. Very rarely were the vocalists... They were never cut in rhythm. The vocalists came in later, and they rehearsed them. And then the strings and horns came in last. And then it was mixed. Jeff Mao Right. So you got a chance to see it almost fully formed at that point when you guys came in with the strings? Larry Gold Yeah. When I heard the record, when they were putting up the mix for us to play, I heard the record. And it was always... I mean, sometimes it was shitty, but most of the time it was brilliant. I don’t know what to tell you. Jeff Mao What do you think you learned from some of the other arrangers you worked under? Because you referred to these guys, Thom Bell, Norman Harris – Larry Gold Ronnie Baker arranged. Jeff Mao Bobby Martin. Larry Gold Bobby Martin. Jeff Mao These are your mentors. Larry Gold Oh my, they are my mentors. Jack Faith. You can’t leave Jack Faith... Tommy Bell was the first one. As I told you yesterday, he came in one day and Gamble was hiring one arranger, and Tommy Bell said, “I bet Larry can do better than him.” And I never arranged for them. And Gamble said, “OK, well let’s give him a try.” And that’s how I met McFadden & Whitehead. Or at least, that’s how I started to work for McFadden & Whitehead. And that was that. It was that simple. Jeff Mao You mentioned MFSB... Larry Gold But it was all based on my being in Philadelphia at the right time. The right place with the right people, the right singers. This is what makes a hit record, you know? All of those elements fall together in one moment, and you get a record that lasts... This record is 45 years old that we just played. Jeff Mao Right. Larry Gold It’s amazing, guys. Jeff Mao Let’s show image number three. This is Larry in the studio back in the day with the string section. Larry Gold Holy mackerel. There I am. This is unusual. They had three cellos and a bass. [points to the screen] But this was my good friend, Romeo DiStefano. He met me when I was 13 years old. And he would get me gigs and he would pick me up because I didn’t drive. He would say, “Oh yeah,” and just pick me up. I can’t say enough good things about some of these older people. You gotta understand, I was a great player, though. And I was a great musician, and they loved me. So I was like a lollipop that they showed off to people. You know what I mean? Jeff Mao Well, you were the young guy, too. Right? Larry Gold I was not only the young guy, but Renaldo used to say to them, “You could never play better than him in your whole life!” You know? Jeff Mao Now, MFSB, you mentioned, is this collective of musicians. Larry Gold Well, it was Mother, Father, Sisters, Brothers, which made it the family. But it was also Motherfuckin’ Son of a Bitch, which made it real Philly. So that was the deal. And it was a studio band, a studio orchestra. Philadelphia wasn’t the only orchestra like that. We talked before, there was a Chicago group, and there was a group in LA. And there was a group in New York. But yeah, we were a collective of musicians. Jeff Mao Let’s show image number four, actually, just so we have an idea of who’s around here. This is outside the Sigma... Larry Gold I didn’t show up to that picture. I think I was a little too high. Jeff Mao Yeah, you missed the photo shoot day. Larry Gold That’s Don Renaldo in the front with the big smile on. And that’s Larry Washington, the great conga player, who leads off in that song. And that’s Bobby Martin behind Don Renaldo. And that’s Richie Jones back there in the afro. He just died this last week. Most of these people are not living anymore. Jeff Mao Now, was it frustrating at any point to be kind of in the background as a sort of faceless group of musicians? Larry Gold Yeah. It was very frustrating. That’s why I started arranging. I mean, we started with... I was already a big star before I ... Big star. Good News, I was doing real well. But I didn’t like it. And I wasn’t gonna put myself in a position where everyday I didn’t want to go out and play. And then traveling, if you’re a traveling musician, it’s the worst kind of life. Somehow, these young kids today, they love it. I don’t know what to tell you. I hated traveling. Jeff Mao Yeah. Well, we’re glad you made it here, at least. Larry Gold I made it here. That was an amazing event, that I made it here. Jeff Mao When you started arranging, it actually coincided with this so called disco backlash, which Gamble and Huff, the Philly sound, had become quite closely associated with, even though I think that’s also kind of a reductive way to talk about Gamble and Huff. They were much more than that. Larry Gold Much more than that. Jeff Mao But they were swept up in this. Larry Gold Big time. Jeff Mao What was it like to go through that? Larry Gold Well, I finally started arranging, and then all of a sudden, “disco sucks” came around. So the whole sound of Philadelphia got put on a back burner. There was a lot of bad disco music, just like there’s a lot of bad music around all the time. But it seemed like people blamed the Philly sound. And the Philly sound, as I told you, [was] my living. All of the sudden, I was making one tenth of what I was making. And I had started arranging and the arranging got put on the backburner for a while, and I was fortunate enough to end up... I met somebody from Sesame Street, and they found out who I was and they listened to me play. Jeff Mao The children’s show, Sesame Street. Larry Gold Children’s show. And I started writing songs for Sesame Street with a lot of the black artists that I grew up with in Philadelphia. Jeff Mao But that’s survival, you know? That’s survival. That’s working to survive. Larry Gold It was better than survival. I enjoyed it. As a matter of fact, I started doing it before the sound of Philly ended, because when I used to go to the studio, I would go in and Gamble would say, “What’d you write for Sesame Street?” Because he loved Sesame Street. And Tommy Bell said, “Can I get a job?” I said, “What do you want, asking me can you get a job?” They already knew that I was headed into working for children’s television at that time. Jeff Mao So what motivated you, some years later, to open your own studio in Philly? Larry Gold Well, you’re taking a big gap. Jeff Mao I am taking a big leap, because I need to condense a little bit. Larry Gold Gamble always had me working through the ‘80s. And as a matter of fact, in the ’80s, I bought a synclavier, which is a sampling... Like what you guys use, except it was one of the predecessors of what you use. And it actually had, back in 1983, it had two minutes worth of memory. And I could record a whole song in this box, background vocals, everything that I needed. And I actually started producing more those days. And mostly how I got into it was producing... In the ‘80s, there was a wave. The R&B wave ended up being a lot of teenage groups. New Edition was one of the most famous ones. But there are a lot of other... There was one in Philadelphia called the Whitehead Bros. And they were John Whitehead, my dear friend who wrote “Back Stabbers,” sons, and Gamble had me in the studio at night, working on an album with them, and they were 13 years old. And so I started working on an album with them, and eventually, that album never came out. But I was at Sigma, and I was actually... And I was learning how to engineer. I was learning other trades. I always had a little bit of knowledge, but I was not hands on, but I became hands on. And the culmination of this story was, I did a lot of teenage R&B during that time, and it ended up with the Whitehead Bros. had a big hit record. I think you know the year better than I do. I’m not gonna remember the year, but I think it was almost 1990, or something like that. And from that point, from the Whitehead Bros., I started meeting... And a little bit before the Whitehead Bros., we got involved with Pop Art Records, which was one of the first early hip-hop labels in the United States. They had Fresh Prince & Jazzy Jeff. They had Salt-N-Pepa. I don’t even remember how many different acts they had. Jeff Mao Steady B, who was from Philly. Larry Gold Right. Jeff Mao Roxanne Shante. Larry Gold Roxanne Shante they had. Coolie C, who ended up in jail. Jeff Mao Cool C. Larry Gold And Steady B, too. Yeah, they had a lot of records. So I ended up helping Lawrence Goodman, who owned Pop Art. I didn’t produce those records, but I helped him with the music. Because he wasn’t making any money from the samples. He was giving that money away, back to the people who he borrowed from, the samples. So what he would do, as I told you yesterday, he’d come in and play us a record and say, “Can you make something that’s similar in feel?” And we did. And it was a cash job. No names involved. And he would give us a G or whatever it was in those days, for the record. I got to meet all those young people, then. And then after the Whitehead Bros. was a big hit, all those people entered my life again. Because I had a little studio. I moved from Sigma. Sigma almost went bankrupt. And I moved from Sigma to another studio and I had a little room there. And everyone just started showing up. I told you, Rodney Jerkins showed up and Jazzy Jeff, who’s Jeff. He’s not Jazzy. But Jeff showed up, and a lot of people showed up. The beginnings of a group called the Jazzyfatnastees showed up, which were one of the products that The Roots produced. Jeff Mao Right. Larry Gold By that time, let’s see. How old was I? I must’ve been in my ’30s, getting to be my late ’30s. And I felt like there was gonna be a renaissance of Philadelphia. And I knew it was gonna include some live... There was some live playing. Michael Jackson ruled the waves in the ’80s. His records, Quincy Jones was genius. And those records, they ruled the waves. But Jodeci was all live music. And some of these other records that were coming out, was a lot. There were guitar players and bass players and maybe drum machine. And I thought to myself, “Well, this is the way I was gonna make the Whitehead Bros. record.” That was first off. And including there was a song on the Whitehead Bros. record called “Beautiful Black Princess” that was just piano and voice, and I put strings on, and people loved it. I didn’t like the studio, I didn’t like the owner of the studio that was there. And so I thought, “OK. I don’t have a lot of money, but whatever money I have, I’m gonna try to find a place and I’m gonna build a room that I wanna build, and it’s gonna be more of a hip-hop, R&B kind of a room.” The room was so loud, you could turn the volume up so much your ears could bleed, but the kids loved it. That was more important. Loud was more important than good, even though it was good. But loud was very important. The first thing these young producers would do, they’d come in and the knob was there, and they’d turn it right to ten. No matter what record was on. And that studio got to be very successful. Jeff Mao And Rodney Jerkins was one of the young producers that came to that studio? Larry Gold He was one of the young producers who came around. As a matter of fact, the first year we were open... Or no, maybe it was the second year. Again, maybe I did too much drugs, because I don’t remember years and things like that at varying different... Jeff Mao It’s okay. We have the internet for that, for fact checking. Larry Gold “The Boy is Mine” was... The vocals weren’t done in my room, but the record was made in the studio. Jeff Mao And you did the strings for this record? Larry Gold I did the strings. Jeff Mao So let’s listen to Brandy & Monica, produced by Rodney Jerkins. “The Boy is Mine,” 1998. Strings by Larry Gold. (music: Brandy & Monica – “The Boy is Mine” / applause) Larry Gold This was Rodney’s first hit. It was number one for 16 weeks in America, which was extraordinary. I think only Elvis Presley was number one longer. But for a kid who’s 16 years old, what a day. Jeff Mao Yeah, not bad. [audience laughter] The harp thing is... Larry Gold It’s sampled. Jeff Mao I thought he played it. Well, is it him playing that figure? Larry Gold Right. Jeff Mao It’s the thing that’s really driving this. I mean, you’re kind of filling in. Larry Gold The melody on this was, to me it was... Jeff Mao Speak into the mic, please. Larry Gold Oh, sorry. The melody on this, it’s like a theme. It’s like a Godfather theme or something. It’s very Italian. And I thought it was really cool against... Because the harp was classical, obviously. And I thought it was cool, driving it against Brandy and Monica singing the way they... Including with the breakdown, you barely hear, but the cello’s going [mimics cello playing]. It always ends up that strings are mixed so low. It always bothers me. But it’s not a string record, so I don’t know what I’m saying. Jeff Mao What do you think you learned from – besides the exuberance and the energy – the younger producers and artists that you were working with? Because [in] this chapter [of] your career you’re working with people of different generations. What do you think you learned from them? Larry Gold I think it was both. They learned from me, and I learned from them. They just had a love for it. And when you have a love for music, that’s something you share in common. When we were talking about my earlier career and... They had the love. And they were young and exuberant and stayed up all night. I would go in the studio, seven or eight in the morning to work on arranging, and they’d be there from the night before. All crashed on the couches. And their music was so loud you could hear it down the block. I tell people that was the first time I really knew I had a studio, when I used to go in and see people sleeping there, and had been there all night. Because that’s how much they loved it. Jeff Mao How would you describe the producer-arranger relationship? Larry Gold Well, with Rodney, I’d known him since he was 13. So that was a special relationship. He called me... He had nicknames for me, and it was special. Jeff Mao Like what? Like what? Larry Gold Larr-man was one of them. Philly dude. I mean, I don’t even remember. I represented the history of Philly music to him, though. Being in the room at the same time. He would always ask, “What do you think? What do you... “ And I was free with my opinions. It was my studio. You know? So I was definitely free with my opinion. Rodney was the first of many young producers. But Rodney brought The Roots to my studio. Because when this record was so big, Ahmir, Questlove, he wanted a little bit of that. So they showed up and James Poyser, who’s another great young producer at the time, showed up, and I started building other little rooms to accommodate everybody, that they had their own little studio. Just like I see this place has all these little rooms and so my studio was... Well, this was ‘98. So from ‘98 on, I started building these little rooms. To the point where, I don’t own the studio anymore. Some other people own the studio, but Ahmir still has a studio there. The Roots still have a studio there, even though they’re in New York all the time, Ahmir has a record collection there, of... His record collection’s still at the studio. The young producers were ... And then they introduced me to so many other people. As I told you before, Ahmir was so happy to be there and to be part of it, that all of a sudden, he would share me with whoever he could share me with. And I felt really blessed that I had such good, young friends, to be perfectly honest with you. Jeff Mao I mean, that Philly, neo-soul, Roots hip-hop scene from that era is, for a lot of people, I would imagine some of the people in this room, that’s the Gamble and Huff era to a prior generation. That represents a really classic era. Larry Gold Well, The Roots’ first album they did in my studio was Things Fall Apart. And there’s interludes that I participated in. There’s an interlude called... See, I’m not gonna remember all these titles, but “Love of –” Jeff Mao “Love of My Life.” Larry Gold “Love of My Life.” There was that [sings]. I remember the melody that I came up with. And they went crazy. And then I did a bunch of other arranging for that record. A little bit here and a little bit there. “You Got Me” has strings on it. Jeff Mao Very subtle, though. Larry Gold Very subtle. Jeff Mao It’s tough to hear. Larry Gold Yeah, it’s very subtle. And it was mixed too low. Bob Power. Don’t want to mention any names, but yeah. Jeff Mao Sorry, Bob. Larry Gold It could’ve been mixed louder. That’s all I’m saying. Jeff Mao But do you think also [that] to actually mix the strings higher for that era is kind of a bold move, too? Because... Larry Gold Yeah, I think they were afraid. Look at Rodney’s record. Look how low the strings are there. I think that they were afraid I was gonna whitewash hip-hop, or something. I don’t even know. Or, clean it up, I really don’t know. But what happened was, within a few years, I had, at my studio, Timbaland. I had Pharrell. I had ... I can’t even remember all the names that came through. But the studio became a hotbed of what was creatively happening at that time. I mean, I did Jill’s first record, where the strings, you can hear. It was just a great time. And we had a club. There was a club that featured. So every Tuesday night, it was an open... I had electric cello I used to come and play. See, that was the little bit of playing I did, and they loved it. And Jill would get up and improvise and everybody... And Ahmir would should up and Tariq would get... You know what I mean? It was fun. It was called the Hot Club, I guess, in Philly. It burned down it was so hot. [audience laughter] Jeff Mao You mentioned Timbaland. Maybe we should play something that he produced that you did string arrangements for. This song is entitled “Cry Me a River.” It is by a singer you may’ve heard of named Justin Timberlake, 2002. Strings by Larry Gold. (music: Justin Timberlake – “Cry Me a River” / applause) Larry Gold Timbaland came to visit at the studio and stayed for a month and a half. He was only gonna come for a night. He had a bus outside that had a studio in the back and a bed, but a studio in the back on the bus. And he came up, and we were having a party. It was around Christmas, it was December. And he fell in love with the whole situation, there. And he ended up staying for six weeks. And then he probably went to another city and did the same thing. I don’t know what to say. But he would come back. I did Justin’s first few records. And they came back. They even flew back ... One time, Justin flew back with Cameron Diaz, who was his girlfriend. And she came to the session. That was sort of an interesting evening. [audience laughter] But I think we did “What Goes Around[...Comes Around]” that session. But, yeah. I don’t know what to say. Jeff Mao When you are given this material... Larry Gold I think I did this one [“Cry Me a River”] almost on the spot. Jeff Mao OK, yeah. What’s that situation like? Larry Gold I mean, I think I did this one in an hour or two. Prior to even doing it. It’s a very simple and... Jeff Mao It is simple, but the simplicity of it is what’s good. Larry Gold And it’s just a string quartet and I think I’m playing on this. I don’t even think I hired a cello player. So it was just a simple... I get it. It’s so hip-hop and Timbaland doing [imitates beat boxing] all his mouth noises and I don’t even know, all of it. And I just didn’t want to get in the way of that. But there was... As the end of the record goes on, the strings, again, give you a little bit more emotional feel. To him crying, “Cry me a river.” Jeff Mao Right. Do you have a preference in terms of material that you get? I mean, this is a... You’re a craftsperson providing a service, on some level. But also, it’s a creative endeavor. Do you feel like when you get a piece of material that... Some of the songs we played are emotional. They are songs about heartbreak, about disappointment, disillusionment. These things seem to go very well with some of your... Larry Gold With strings. Jeff Mao String arrangements. Is there a preference for you, when you actually get the material, in terms of subject matter, in terms of what it is? Larry Gold There’s no real preference. I like to have at least a week to think about it. I don’t like doing it on the spot. But to people like Timbaland, they want it done then. You know? “Oh, come on up with four musicians, and bring four musicians in and we’ll just sit around and you just write something.” You know? So I did. That happened on more than one occasion. I don’t like saying that I can do it overnight or in one day or something like that, because I like... First of all, I don’t like having that kind of pressure. But “Flashing Lights,” I did in one evening. So next day I recorded it. And Kanye [West] just sent it to me. I think Kanye tried a arranger in California, and he didn’t like what they did on that album. And I think what happened was, someone mentioned my name to him, and he just sent it to me. And he said, “Can you get it to me tomorrow? I’m mixing it.” And I said, “What do you mean, get it to you tomorrow?” And he said, “I want a big string intro.” And I said, “OK, well give me one day and I’ll record it the next day.” And I think there were two or three songs that I did on that record. Jeff Mao Right, right. The Graduation record. Larry Gold You’re right. Jeff Mao So then, pulling it together at the last minute, do you have go-to people that you... Larry Gold I have a string session that I’ve used. As a matter of fact, yeah. One or two of the string players, I’ve known since the ‘80s. And the rest are young people from the schools. And I’m always trying different people and... But yeah, I have a group of people that I use all the time. Jeff Mao In terms of Kanye or any producer giving you a direction, I guess that’s enough, right? I mean, “I want a big string intro.” Larry Gold He didn’t even give me a direction, he just said, “I want a string intro on ‘Flashing Lights,’” and that’s all he said. And then he sent me those other songs, and I just did whatever I wanted to do. And then I sent it to him, and he loved it. So that was the end of that. Jeff Mao And he mixed it. Larry Gold To the point that, I think I did the next record, 808s & Heartbreak with him, and I think I did the one after that. And then I even did another, when he proposed to Kim [Kardashian], he rented out... I think he rented out where the San Francisco Giants play, he rented out the ballpark. And he had an orchestra, and he proposed to Kim... Kim’s favorite song at the time was “Born to Die.” Jeff Mao Lana Del Rey, yeah. Larry Gold I did the string arrangement on “Born to Die,” but I did a string version, completely, of “Born to Die.” Jeff Mao For the proposal? Larry Gold For the proposal. And that was... Yeah. There was a 60-piece orchestra. Just him on his knees. No one in the audience. There are pictures. You can go to the internet. I’m sure you can find it. Jeff Mao Wow. Larry Gold And I didn’t go. He didn’t invite me to come and conduct it. Jeff Mao You didn’t get an invitation to the proposal? Larry Gold Nah. Jeff Mao And you did the string arrangement? Larry Gold I sent the arrangement. Jeff Mao Wow. That’s got to be disappointing. Larry Gold It was bizarre enough that I would’ve probably gone, you know? [audience laughter] But I didn’t go. Jeff Mao Well, the arrangement on “Flashing Lights” is wonderful, and I think we should listen to it. So let’s listen to Kanye West featuring Dwele, “Flashing Lights.” Larry Gold And Jill Scott. Jeff Mao And Jill Scott. 2007. Strings by Larry Gold. (music: Kanye West feat. Dwele – “Flashing Lights” / applause) Larry Gold Oh. Got comfortable, there. Jeff Mao Is it a different approach when you’re doing something that’s strictly drum machine, hip-hop sort of related? Larry Gold I came up with a little theme that I sample, sort of. Even though I played it through. But if you go through that arrangement, I’m leaning very heavily on four or five notes. And I keep featuring those four or five notes, which, in a way, simplifies the arrangement. There’s not a lot of playing. Let’s put it that way. Jeff Mao Yeah, but I mean, I can’t even imagine the song without those strings. Larry Gold That’s a great arrangement. See? Jeff Mao It is a great arrangement. Larry Gold That’s a great arrangement. And if you played just the strings, it’s a pretty good arrangement, this one. And it’s mixed well. Yes. I don’t know who mixed it, but kudos to the mixer. Jeff Mao When you’re working in the pop realm... You mentioned Lana Del Rey. And you’ve worked with... Larry Gold Well, Lana Del Rey, my hookup was Emile Haynie. I told you that. Jeff Mao Right. Larry Gold Who comes from hip-hop. Jeff Mao Right. Well, that’s actually the other interesting thing. Your career – and we were talking about this a little bit earlier – it’s all overlapped in a really organic way. I mean people could look and say, “OK, Gamble and Huff, neo-soul period, 2010s era, pop music,” and maybe see them as disparate groupings. But there is an overlap. The people who made these records also made these records and brought you in, which I think is an important thing to keep in mind. It’s easy to sort of stand back and look at something as being, “This is a genre, this is a genre, this is an era.” But it’s really the outgrowth of different communities. Larry Gold Yeah. I think you’re right. And my approach is always... I’m just adding Larry Gold, at this point, which is part Gamble, part Huff, part Bell, part classical music, part... There’s so many different parts that I don’t break myself down. It’s music. You know? I mean, the bottom line is, I adore music. Jeff Mao And as far as technology and how you embrace it... Larry Gold Well I tried to keep up as best as I could, but it left me behind a little bit. I don’t really... I work with my old computer, the synclavier, still. And I still use a lot of pencil. And I still write an awful lot. And I have a young man that comes in – he’s not so young anymore. But he copies it into the computer and then he shows it to me on the computer, and I tell him what I wanna change and basically, I guess he’s my copyist. And I always had a copyist. But originally, the copyist would work from my written score. And now they work from either a tonal score, or my written score, or a computer score. Those things changed over the course of my lifetime. Jeff Mao You’ve chosen to stay in Philadelphia, as well. Larry Gold Yes. My wife has taught school in Philadelphia. I’ve raised a daughter in Philadelphia, and maybe I should’ve moved at one point, but I lost that point. And I opened the studio. And the studio consumed... I guess I opened the studio in around ‘96, or something like that, ‘95. And it consumed my life until probably... I sold it about, maybe seven years ago. So until 2011, I was involved on a day-to-day basis. And by the time 2011 rolled around, maybe we should’ve moved to California, but maybe, shoulda, coulda, woulda. I was getting so much work just coming in over the phone, and them sending me songs, and the internet was playing up so much, to the point where if someone wants to hear what I’m doing, we can have Skype and I can sit there and play it for them or have it... Or send them... I don’t like sending demos. I’d much rather play it for somebody on the phone and talk to them about it, prior to bringing in live instruments. Jeff Mao You brought something, which is an actual score of some of your work. This is for a track by the singer Ne-Yo. And you actually also brought a different rough mix of the song entitled “Queen.” Larry Gold I don’t even know whether the song ever came out. It was on a movie. Jeff Mao It came out on some sort of a soundtrack, I think. Larry Gold OK, OK. Jeff Mao The Birth of a Nation, I believe. Larry Gold Right. That movie bombed right away. Jeff Mao Song is still good, though. Larry Gold I know. Jeff Mao So I wonder if we might show image number five, which is the score. Actually, no, I’m sorry. Larry Gold Woah. Jeff Mao That’s image number five. Larry Gold Holy moly. Jeff Mao Image number six, actually. That’s MFSB. [image appears on screen] Larry Gold So this is what this score looks like. And this is another one that’s just piano and Ne-Yo. Jeff Mao And it’s a rough mix, so we can hear the strings nice and clear. Larry Gold Right. Jeff Mao So why don’t we listen to it, and I guess... Let me see. What’s the best way to do this? You guys have the time stamp? Yeah? You good? You sure? Alright. So we’re gonna play this, and then we’ll sort of... If you want to, you can kind of follow along as we get to the different points in the song; these guys are gonna turn the page. So this is Ne-Yo, the rough mix of “Queen” featuring strings by Larry Gold, 2016. (music: Ne-Yo – “Queen” (rough mix) / applause) Jeff Mao What do you want to say about this in terms of a string arrangement? Larry Gold I love most strings. I’m a cellist. The cello is low compared to the violin, which is high. So even my violin writing a lot of the times is more within the realm of the lower register. Not the lower register per se of the violin, but lower register. And it adds a warmth to it. To me, on a track like this, the piano provides enough top and again, I’m just following Ne-Yo, basically. I’m just trying to not get in his way. And every once in a while when he stops singing, I move a little bit more. And that’s sort of been my habit since I’ve been younger doing this; I’m really aware of the vocalist and not really stepping on their toes. And I like this song. I thought it was a very well-written song. Jeff Mao Yeah, it’s quite beautiful. You’re 70 years old, as you mentioned. What haven’t you done that you still would like to do? Larry Gold Well, yeah, I could name a zillion things that I’d like to do, but whether life will let me do those things or not... I’ve never done movies per se. I would love to do a little bit just to see. I would love to work with some people. I like collaborating, and I don’t get the chance anymore because everyone moved out of Philadelphia. I’m sort of left by myself a lot. The Roots moved and Jill moved and everybody moved. In life, when you move to another area you build new friendships and new things. So in one way I feel like I’ve been left aside and in certain times I feel that way, but I’m also fucking 70 years old. So give me a break here. Most 70 year olds don’t even get out of bed. They do, but I don’t know what I expect. I think my expectations since I was a little boy have been way too high, but that’s what drives me. Jeff Mao We’re going to open it up to questions in just a moment, but the last question I want to ask you is, when you talk about strings bringing a depth of feeling to a piece of music, it’s of course the sound of the strings themselves, but the instruments don’t play themselves and the arrangements don’t write themselves. These are from people. So, what do you think it is within you as a person that brings out this depth of feeling? Where does your depth of feeling come from? Larry Gold I’m a pretty emotional dude. I could cry at a minute’s notice. That’s the way I’ve been since I was little. So the cello has always represented sadness to me. When my daughter was little and we would watch movies or TV together, as soon as I heard the cello, I would say, “Uh-oh. Someone’s going to die or someone’s going to get sick.” And she was maybe four years old and by the time she was six years old, she heard the cello and would go, “Uh-oh.” It’s a mournful instrument. I don’t know what to tell you. It can also be a joyful instrument. I’m not going to say it can’t be. But, like you said before, most of the time when people hire me to do an arrangement, the song’s usually about someone breaking up or someone’s got fucked up somehow. So the strings play right into that, into that situation. But, I pride myself on still being a hippie and still have that open mind and being loose about my life, even though it’s pretty formal and tight. I don’t know what to say. But I do feel honored and blessed that I’ve had such a long, fruitful career. Jeff Mao Well, we feel honored and blessed that you’ve been with us here today. So let’s say thanks once again to Larry Gold. [applause] Larry Gold Thank you. You’re too kind. I’m going to get verklempt. Jeff Mao Alright, so anybody have questions? We have a microphone. Audience Member Hi, hi. How can you describe the main role of the strings in the songs that you arrange for? Like, what is the main goal the strings try to...? Larry Gold Bring out the feelings and the emotion, like I said. Like on a song like “Cry Me a River,” as simple as it is, he’s talking about a breakup, so I try to add a little bit of emotional depth. In the same way, like we were just saying, in a movie, when you hear the music come in, depending on the kind of movie it is, it adds another element to it. I think the early days of string writing in popular music, it was more based on the melody and more based on... There was an old Philly trick that when you weren’t sure what you were going to write on those old songs, you just copied the melody, you just went with the unified theme of that record. I still do that a lot. But I use a lot of chords, like it’s quartet or like it’s quarter work. And I think that earlier-on in my career I did a lot of solo work, like little lines that would go with not so many chords. But it’s hard for me to describe. Every song is different and that’s what made it such a nice life so far. I mean, I get to share my talent with their talent and I get paid... well. Jeff Mao Anyone else have a question? Audience Member Hey, Larry. So you mentioned that the development of technology and stuff changed your workflow in terms of going from... Larry Gold Say it again. I’m sorry. Audience Member You mentioned about how technology has developed and how that’s changed your workflow. I was wondering ... Larry Gold It’s changed the record business. Audience Member Right. Larry Gold You make records on computers these days. Audience Member Yeah, well that’s what I was going to say. So, now with huge advancements in terms of sample packs and the availability of decent sounding strings to most people, has that affected you in terms of the work you get and what you’re writing for and the quality of string writing in a lot of music that you don’t have a part of? Larry Gold I think it simplified everything a little bit, because... I’m not saying it’s good or bad. I’m just saying it simplified everything. So many young people now, you have a string sound and they write their strings. For a period of time when all that was just invented, the first thing the young producer would say to me, “Did you listen to my strings?” And I said, “Sure I did. I wrote them out. That was the first thing I did was write out your strings.” “Oh, please use my melody.” I said, “I will use your melody. I will try to enhance your melody.” I try to be respectful, because they worked on the record. They were at their home or the bedroom or whatever, the studio, and they were the ones who did the records. So I am trying to be a little respectful, but sure it’s changed everything. I’d rather have an empty, blank canvas. Then, whatever I do is easy. Audience Member Do you find yourself writing for situations that aren’t going to be played live, like arrangements for string sample instruments and stuff like that? Larry Gold I didn’t understand. Audience Member Do you find yourself getting work which is not going to be recorded live and do you have an aversion to that? Larry Gold Very seldom. I do do that sometimes, but very, very seldom. My whole reputation is based on records, but I have done that. I’ve done that for people that I know and people that I don’t know, but not too often. People don’t really call me for that kind of stuff. Everyone’s sort of pigeonholed in life, aren’t they? If you had a hit record that was techno, and you wanted to make a live record after that, everybody would say, “Oh, I don’t know about that.” It’s like everyone pigeonholes everybody in life, I think, whether you’re a doctor or a cellist. You have your specialty. I’d love to do more, different kinds of work, but if you don’t get the calls, how are you going to do it? So, mostly it’s records. Jeff Mao Anyone else have a question? Audience Member Hello. First of all, thank you for being here with us today and sharing your experience. I wanted to ask a question. As I now play and sing with an orchestra in Moscow, I was doing it for quite a long time now, and I noticed that this music is just these days not getting into the ears of people, not getting inside. Like nobody really likes it anymore, I just feel it and... Larry Gold Well, I... Is that the question? Audience Member You notice that putting a cello or violin
into the record, it’s like bringing up emotions and it seems to me like people don’t really like being involved into someone’s emotions. It’s like seeing someone as naked and they say, like, “Oh, he’s naked. I don’t want to see it.” Yeah, and it’s something like that. Do you kind of feel it in the same way? Larry Gold Well, I think that strings on records are less and less right now. So, I don’t know. I can’t speak for your generation or the generation that’s going to come after, but I think technology changes everything. And I think right now... This young man talked about... It’s great that you have the opportunity to sing live with an orchestra. That’s thrilling. I wish more people would appreciate orchestral music and all different kinds of music. But, people in our life, we do get pigeonholed. We do decide. I hope I answered your question a little bit, but I don’t think people are afraid of emotion, though. If I take the last generation that I worked with, like a Jill Scott, she’s not afraid of feelings. I don’t think Lana Del Rey was afraid of feelings either. I think they wanted that. I don’t know, though. I don’t know what’s going to be in the future as far as... I’ve done some orchestral work, and it tends to get washed away a little bit, if that makes any sense to you. It gets to be too much for the younger generation. It seems to me it’s much more interesting... Like I was watching television the other night in Berlin, and somebody was singing with a quartet and it was pretty good. It seems to me that, if it was an orchestra, it would have been too much of a wash, where the string quartet made it more intimate, all the players were into it, you could tell. I don’t know. Audience Member I’m sorry. That may be a little bit boring question, but do you at times not record the strings you write yourself? Larry Gold I mostly play. Like, I could pick my cello up and just play, and not any people, just out of my head. It’s interesting. I’ve had a life where people have hired me all the time to do what I do, and when they stop hiring me, maybe I should write all my ideas and expand them, and I probably will. But, I really haven’t had that much time to be able to have that leisure to do that. Audience Member And are there times when there are other engineers recording stuff you are writing? And when that happens, do you have a certain sound in mind before and you kind of tell them how to mic the strings or process them, that sort of stuff? Larry Gold I’ve had the same engineer now for 20 years, 25 years. He knows what I like, and if I don’t like... We get into the studio, we have the strings there, and I start listening in the ear phones, and if the mic sounds too far away, I say, “Oh, bring those. Bring the mics in tighter. I don’t hear enough presence on the cello. The viola part needs to come out more, either you’re going to play a little louder or move the mic closer.” Part of the thing about the old Philly sound was it was very tight miked. Now, most everybody likes miking far away. So, that’s part of the wash that you hear and you don’t hear the distinctness. I like hearing that distinctive... I’ve had the cello in my ear my whole life, so I like that. I like, I guess what you would call tight miking. But I’ve used the same people for years and years and years, and you get used to it. It’s like your bed. You just expect, you expect what you expect. And I mostly do soul records, so there’s a certain sound that I think that over the course of my lifetime, I’m going for and I’m always trying to get to that spot, both engineering-wise and musically. Audience Member For most of us, hiring an orchestra is probably not within our budget, so do you have a recommended, go-to configuration or ensemble for getting a full sound with no money? Larry Gold Well, when you say no money, there’s always a little bit of money, because I don’t like using musicians then don’t pay them. I can’t do that. But “Cry Me a River” was probably like just four to six instruments. Some of these songs are 15 instruments, but the budget can do that. Usually, you can do something pretty good with four violins or a smaller kind of a group. I mean, the Ne-Yo song probably was only four violins, two violas and two cellos. Usually, I use six violins, two violas and two cellos. That’s what I use, ten players. And a lot of times, if I want it to sound bigger, I’ll move the mics on the second take. So if I have one set of strings at a tight mic, then I’ll do another version of the same thing where I move the mics a little bit. And it gets a different sound, then I blend the two together. So, by doubling them, all of a sudden I have 20 strings players. And there’s some times I’ll even do it three times, so then I have 30 string players, because I want it to sound more like an orchestra. But nobody can afford an orchestra anymore. I mean, Kanye can out of his pocket from his clothing company. I remember when these kids in hip-hop in the late ‘90s... We were sitting in my studio once and one of The Roots said to me, “Somebody just came out with a new sneak and it sold out the first day.” I think it was Jay-Z, and it sold out the first day, and someone looked over and said, “Oh, dude made $20 million today.” And I looked at him, I said, “You’re kidding me.” I had no idea that clothing was going to be... But it seems that’s the way, in the last 20 years, they make more money from clothing than they do their records. And I guess that’s what they call branding. I was never into branding. I’m just a simple cello player. But nobody can hire an orchestra anymore. Even when I say, “Oh, I want to use ten string players.” “Oh, it’s too expensive.” So, I even get shit for it, so I don’t know what to say. Audience Member Hey. Thank you so much. It’s been so interesting. I wonder, when you get a song
that you’re going to put strings on, what’s the first thing you do when you get that? Larry Gold I write out the chords. I write out the bassline, depending on the record, I listen 100 times to the melody. I get to know the song to the point where I can hear it all in my head, so that when I go home at night ... When I go home at night, sometimes I think about the string lines while I’m sitting there or while I’m sleeping. I’ll wake up in the morning or when I go for a long walk, all of a sudden the song comes to me and I’m hearing the way the things are going to work within the context of the song. Music is memory. Everyone should understand that music is memory. You remember a pitch, you remember a piece, you remember this. It’s all memory. So, that’s the first thing I do. I memorize what I’m going to be working on. Audience Member So do you usually play or play the arrangement some way at first, or do you think of it and then write it dow; or do you play it on the cello, or do you play it on the piano, the chords? Larry Gold I never play it on the cello. I told you, for 25 years I didn’t even take my cello out of the case, basically. I have samples. I have string samples that I use, that I play. Once I start formulating my ideas, I put the ideas into my old synclavier and I sit around and I put it on repeat and I sit on my couch and I listen. And I start changing things, back and forth or I put the arrangement up on the computer so I can see like you saw, and I start moving things around, “Oh, that’s too much here. This is the ... “ Audience Member Thanks. Audience Member Hello. Larry Gold Hello. Audience Member You mentioned earlier you spend a lot of time with your instrument. I was just wondering, how do you keep practice time interesting? Larry Gold How do I keep what? Audience Member Practicing, or time with your instrument, how do you keep it interesting without getting bored, and what’s your practice routine like? Larry Gold Well, in the last two years, I picked my cello up again seriously and so... It was like rebuilding. My hands were sore. I couldn’t play. I had no callouses. And I promised myself I would play very slowly and I would not force myself into situations where I would sound shitty. And I just very painstakingly play, and I don’t get bored because it’s life. It’s my breath in my life, so I really don’t get bored of it. And I progress slowly, just like you do when you’re a child learning an instrument. You learn how to play the open strings and you learn how to play... There’s a famous old movie called... I think Bill Murray [was in it] and he used “baby steps,” he called it. Well, I do baby steps. I think music is baby steps. When I build an arrangement, it’s baby steps. I start here, and I move to this part and I do this or I do this. Very seldom do I do the whole thing all in one shot. I like giving myself, whether it be writing or playing, I like giving myself a little bit of time to develop it. Audience Member You mentioned you haven’t touched your cello in two years. How did it feel to not be able to play or to not have time to play your instrument that gives you joy? Larry Gold Well, you know what? I was trying to make a life for myself in my old age and I didn’t think I would go back to playing the cello, and I knew it would have to do with records, so I really didn’t mind giving up my cello for those years, but I still did music every day. There was years there when I arranged vocals, when there were three or four young vocalists in the room. And that’s like writing strings. It’s similar. And it’s all a learning experience. And again, I talked about baby steps. I think one of the things about making a record is you have to be able to imagine yourself playing, like with you and your computers you’re playing the bass or you’re doing the drums or you’re doing a violin or... So, you have to get into it and use your imagination. But I think it’s baby steps. Jeff Mao So guys, I think we’re going to wrap it. Larry is going to be around this evening in the studio, so if you have any more questions that you think of you can always hit him up. He’s going to be hanging around for the rest of the afternoon, and he’s just as entertaining off the couch as he is on. So it’s a wonderful opportunity to just talk to him. But, I can’t think you enough again for being here. [applause] Larry Gold I can’t thank you guys enough. Thank you.

Title: Lido Pimienta

Lido Pimienta
Lido Pimienta is much like her music: a complex tapestry of influences and ideas rooted in independent thought and human experience. The Toronto-based, Colombia-born artist made her debut in 2010 with Color, a collection of songs written in Baranquilla that pulled from youthful experiences with metal, identity, motherhood and, quite literally, finding her voice. In the following years she moved from London, Ontario to Toronto and studied art criticism and music production. She delved further into the potentials of using her voice in combination with loop pedals and electronic production and connected with local musicians, such as Kvesche Bijons-Ebacher and Blake Blakely, who helped Pimienta fashion the sound of her second album, 2016’s La Papessa. That album, self-produced and full of layered compositions, from the sonics to the subject matter, won the 2017 Polaris Music Prize and received numerous public accolades from both Canadian and international media. In 2018, she signed with American label Anti, reissuing La Papessa in anticipation of her new record, Miss Colombia, which continues to explore Afro-Colombian music traditions and ideas of ownership and identity through Pimienta’s unique lens.
Sitting on the couch at the Red Bull Music Academy Bass Camp Calgary 2019, Pimienta spoke frankly and at length about how personal experiences have shaped her artistic approach, the lessons of collaboration and independence, and why Miss Colombia has become not just a record but “a language, a thesis.”
Hosted by Anupa Mistry Please help me welcome the Polaris Prize winning singer, songwriter and producer from Barranquilla, Colombia via London, Ontario, Canada and Toronto, here to Calgary. Lido Pimienta. [applause] Lido Pimienta Humbled, very humble. Anupa Mistry Welcome. So, you’re back home in Toronto after spending some time in Colombia recording your – spoiler alert – new record. I want you to set the scene for us, because I don’t know how many people here have actually been to Colombia. Can you tell us about, I guess, Barranquilla? Who lives there? What does it look like? What does it sound like? What does it smell like? Take us to your home. Lido Pimienta OK. So, Barranquilla. I mean, my Barranquilla might not be the same Barranquilla for a lot of folks because I have never been a regular. I’ve always existed in this confused hyphen. Even though as a Colombian, I should fit in. But I never did because I was interested in electronic music from a very, very, very young age. I’m not supposed to, because I am half black and half indigenous, and we don’t really have those distinctions in Colombia. But to me, I was definitely one, because I went to this school called the Lyndon B. Johnson School where you’re not allowed to speak Spanish. It was very hard because everyone in my class was like Melanie and Stephanie and… Anupa Mistry It was an American school? Lido Pimienta Yeah, it was based in Colombia, but all of the morals and everything was taught from Catholic, capitalist, US-adoring point of view. So, I was a weirdo. Not only am I not blonde, blue eyes; my mom comes to school wearing these weird outfits. My food is cooked. Why don’t you just buy the... Those things. That it’s like… it was cultural. I would have kids come… They would take my hair, and they would put it under a microscope to study it, because why isn’t it straight? That was my Barranquilla. Because I went to this bougie private school, I rebelled against that because I didn’t feel welcome in that scenario. My Barranquilla. While the mainstream one is like Carnival. Yeah, it’s just Carnival and Sofía Vergara, she grew up there. I actually went to school with Sofía Vergara’s first cousin. She would drop by our school and everything would stop. I would love it when she would come by, because everyone in Colombia is horny as f---. So, they would just stop. I would just leave the school. I would just go home and draw on my walls or whatever. My Barranquilla was metal. That was my sh-t. I would just grab a bus, and I would go to the south side of the city, which is not where the bougie people live, and I was in bands. I was 11 years old. My mom never knew that I was taking the bus to go to the periphery of the city to be in a hardcore metal band and scream into a microphone. But the microphones that we had were pieces of sh-t. All of our instruments were made or scraps that we found. When I moved to London, Ontario, and I went to my first punk show, everything was like new. Orange. You know Orange, the brand? The whole set of Orange, but they’re punk. I just didn’t. It made no sense to me, and I even saw one of the kids being driven by their parents in a really fancy car. I’m like, “I thought that punk... Never mind.” It’s always been… I’m just confused. In Barranquilla, I just experimented and I was lucky because I was able to infiltrate metal, but also electronic music and also traditional music. My voice allowed that to happen. It was very diverse and very experimental and very dangerous for a 12-year-old. But, yeah, I still don’t drink, and I don’t do drugs, so it was fine. Anupa Mistry Maybe that might surprise people to hear that there’s a thriving metal scene in this Colombian city. It shouldn’t, but maybe you could tell us a little bit more about that world. Lido Pimienta I mean, I think Bogota has one of the biggest metal fan bases in the world. We compete with Scandinavia or whatever. But, yeah, it looks like some Colombian guy with very long hair sweating a lot because he’s wearing all black, and it’s very hot. It’s 31 every single day of the year. Freaks! We hate everything. My metal friends hated my electronic friends. I’m never going to forget, one of them was like, “You know what music you listen to? That electronic music? Let me give you a song right now. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. You think that’s good?” That is excellent, actually. I love it, but that’s kind of how I grew up. I still don’t care. I think that music is great. I think that music is great and you should love all of it. Because, also, we’re very mixed. We have Spanish blood. We have indigenous blood. We have black, and we have everything. When we listen to music, we are understanding it from so many points of view. I understand it. You play me anything, I will understand it immediately. It’s not confusing to me, and the more foreign [it is], I identify myself with it more. I don’t know, I think metal, I was just able to scream. Guttural. It just gave me this thing that I felt really good and safe. Because, another thing about Colombian culture is that it’s very... How do you say? It’s not fake, but it’s of appearance, appearances. We don’t have sweet 16. We have quinceañera. Anupa Mistry For 15. Lido Pimienta When you turn 15, what are you going to get? Are you going to get a flight somewhere? Are you going to get a car? Or are you going to get new lips or new boobs? A new ass, perhaps? I was the antithesis of that. When I turned 15, I threw a metal show in my apartment building and it was madness. But that’s what I did. So I was just this weirdo. Even at 16 years old, I’m walking down the streets of Bogota, and I will have people pointing at me like, “Look at that clown.” It would hurt me, but now I’m just like, “Yes! Bring your clown, yes girl.” Back then, you don’t understand it. You just feel like you’re so out of the narrative of what it means to be Colombian and what it means to be a woman, because the fact to… I wasn’t wearing the revealing and the tight – my mom, to this day, her dream is to see me wearing a J-Lo outfit on stage. “I just don’t think that it really goes with my message of indigenous sovereignty if I’m dressed like J-Lo, mother.” But, she can dress like J-Lo, and she does. So, good for her. Anupa Mistry I wish we had some of the metal you grew up listening to, to play, but we do have some Colombian music that you told me you grew up listening to. Let’s listen to something that is not metal, but is from Colombia. Do you want to set it up? This is this track. Lido Pimienta [looks into laptop] Oh, “Chambacu?” If people here are in electronic music, you probably heard this in some mix. This song has been remixed, I don’t even know how many times. A lot of producers around the world will email me and ask me if I want to do a version of this song, but the invitation never comes with a cheque attached to it. So I’m like, “No.” But, yeah, this song is from Aurita Castillo. She was a child when she did this. She had this group, and the song is called “Chambacu.” Chambacu used to be, I don’t know, the closest equivalent would be a reservation. The town doesn’t really exist anymore. It’s like this legend where it’s just one of the places where black people or slaves would start making their homes. The second place is San Basilio de Palenque. San Basilio de Palenque actually was the first free town from slavery in all of the Americas. They have this relation, but what I like about this track is because I could see myself, because the track is really somber, as it is happy. I’m all about that. (music: Aurita Castillo – “Chambacu” / applause) Anupa Mistry So, that’s a cumbia track. Can you tell us about cumbia? Lido Pimienta Well, I think that track is really good, because it shows the nuance of cumbia. Because, cumbia is this genre that takes many shapes and many forms from central to South America. In the States, too, the new generation of cumbia, native folks in North America are making cumbia. So, this is just one of the many faces and shapes that cumbia takes. Cumbia is very important for Colombians, especially on the North Coast. I’m from the North Coast, and we love to dance our cumbia, and it’s part of an identity. Why I love this song is because this song is happy, and at the same time, it’s very somber. When the guy starts saying [imitates somber, deep voice], “Chambacu,” that’s very… The intonation is not what we’re supposed to or used to listening to in cumbia, which is [imitates high pitched singing]. That is cumbia, but this is... No, we’re going to get this little nine-year-old tell us about how much she loves her borough that is no longer going to be here. We’re going to talk about how much we love it, even though a lot of classism and racism happens because that’s also another sad trait of Colombia. We hate ourselves. We love ourselves when it’s Carnival season, and then back to hating ourselves. Cumbia, the cumbia in Argentina, cumbia is huge, but it also is frowned upon as the music of the poor. But, then there’s all this new movement of DJs and producers that are taking cumbia, and they’re adding modern beats to it. Now, it’s like, “Well, yes, cumbia at the club.” But, I think it’s also normal in any traditional music. These are the waves of it, but to me, you can add any beat to any cumbia music, but this track, it needs nothing. It needs nothing, and it’s still as relevant today as it was 50 years ago. Anupa Mistry Can you give us a bit of... Your music really deals in the fact that you’re an indigenous woman. You’re a black woman. You’re Canadian. You’re singing in Spanish about all of these things and what it is like in this body. But, I’m wondering, and you kind of gave us a bit of background. You went to this school, and you’re seen as quite different, and Colombian society is stratified in certain ways. But how did your consciousness around these ideas actually develop to the point where you’re like, “OK, this is something I need to put into my arts practice, or this is something I want to engage with through art.” Lido Pimienta It didn’t, like a eureka moment. It didn’t happen, because this is just a part of my reality, and I grew up with my mother’s family, which is the indigenous side. When in your classroom, when you’re a tween, and the cliques are developing, and you want to be cool, and you want everyone to like you, but you just don’t fit. You’re always going to be a weirdo because everyone is going to Miami, Orlando for vacations or summer break or whatever, but you’re going to the desert to help your uncle kill a lamb and then learn how to properly get rid of the blood and use everything in the animal. That’s not cool. That’s not cool.
How am I going to top going to Orlando Studios with, “Yeah, there’s no toilets in the desert”? That’s not… Growing up like that, it’s just my experience. I just speak about my reality. I don’t sit on a rainy day and decide, well, today, I should really write about how hard it is to deal with my period, and I should really talk about... I don’t do that. It just comes when I’m changing my baby’s diaper, when my son comes, and he’s like, “So, what happens after we die?” “Can you ask me later? Let me figure it out myself. Then I can tell you.” I’m washing the dishes for the kid. A song will come, and then it happens to be about giving birth. Anupa Mistry So, when you’re 11, signing in this metal band, were you singing about what you were experiencing in school? Lido Pimienta I wasn’t singing about what I was experiencing in school, because to me, that was normal. I didn’t know that it was f---ed up, what was happening, and the micro-aggressions and the violence that I was experiencing and the other-ing that I experienced by teachers and the kids alike. It didn’t really make sense until I moved to Canada, where we actually have those conversations. In Canada, we talk about everything. There is a couch for everything in Canada. In Colombia, if you start talking about anything, you have to do it in someone’s home. Lock the door, no one can know what’s happening because someone can get hurt. Trans issues and indigenous issues. When the president just got elected, in the week that he was elected, over 25 activists were killed in their homes, decapitated. So, that’s one of the reasons why I moved. When my mom started realizing what I was singing about… Anupa Mistry What were you singing about, though? Lido Pimienta The government and the president, the oppression as young people, and because I was able to escape the bougie bubble of the Lyndon B. Johnson School, I would experience what kids my age were experiencing in the peripheries. I was like, “This periphery is very similar to what happens in the desert in the North Coast of Colombia, in La Guajira which borders Venezuela. OK, I need to talk about this.” Even if I wasn’t conscious about it, that’s just my life. I was just talking about how oppressed we were, how I couldn’t wear whatever I wanted because of the... Here, there’s cat calling. Over there, it’s straight-up sexual abuse. It’s sexual abuse with young, little, little kids. Taxi drivers, again, at 15 in a cab by myself, hell no. You have to go with a whole crew because bad sh-t can happen to you. I was not happy with those things. I also was reading a lot of Naomi Klein and just learning about Angela Davis. I was the only 12-year-old that was reading this stuff. That will just add to this weirdo. Yeah, but in the future, you’re still going to be needing your parents to take care of you, and that’s not going to be my narrative. That’s just what I did. It’s still what I do now. When people are like, “Lido, how can we cure racism in Canada?” My name is not Lido. Right? When they say that to me, I’m just like, “Talk about it.” I don’t know. There wasn’t a moment that defined. No, it was just occurrence. It’s just my life. I just put it out there. Anupa Mistry So, we’re going to hear something that you… some of your music in a second; but I guess before that, what is the kind of... What do you see as the thread between your early metal days and the music that you’re making now, aside from the content? Just in terms of the expression, whatever you’re getting from the art making itself. Do you see a connection between that and the kind of music that you’re making now? Lido Pimienta I’m just tough. I’m tough, and metal is tough. It’s angry. Really, screaming is great. Releasing that anger is really great. I’ve gone through a lot of turmoil and tragedy and bad stuff, so when I’m on stage, I’m very empowered, and I feel like I’m the baddest bitch when I’m on stage, and that’s my stage. I always say it. I feel bad for whoever has to perform after me, because I just demolish that. It makes me feel really good that even for those 45 to an hour minutes, I was able to just bring it. It just feels really good [grunts]. It just feels really good when you’re like, [grunts]. That feels great. That just feels really good, then you hit them with that [grunts] and then, you go [sings softly] like that. To me, that’s f---ed up. Yeah, I just went from down here to all the way up here, like life. Because your life changes in a second. In a second, your life will be f---ed up or really happy. With me, the good... Immediately after something good happens, some f---ed up thing happens. OK, I’m just expressing myself, guys. I’m just living my best life as best that I can. Anupa Mistry With that, let’s listen to a track from 2010, your first LP called Color. It’s called “Humano.” “Humano”? Lido Pimienta “Humano.” Anupa Mistry “Humano.” (music: Lido Pimienta – “Humano” / applause) So, what can you tell us about that track? It came out in 2010. It’s from your first record. I wanted to play that because I think we were talking, and I feel like your sound is... That’s kind of the foundation of your sound, and you’ve built up and around it. But, yeah, tell us about that song. Then we can talk a little bit about the first record in general, too. Lido Pimienta Yeah, so the… Color was a group or collection of songs that I had written while I was in Colombia. Then I moved to Canada, learned about… Anupa Mistry You were 16 when you moved to Canada. Lido Pimienta I was 19. Anupa Mistry Oh, 19, wow. Lido Pimienta I was 19, and then I met baby dad number one, had a baby, went to school. When I was making, well, this song, I wrote actually in Canada after... Any of you saw the Polaris thing, when I was talking about an Aryan specimen that told me to go back to my country? That song, I wrote after someone told me to go back to my country. It was about this thing with orders and just trying to understand who I am or where I am, or where am I going? And, how in the end, we’re just human. Also, I forgot to mention El Salvador in there, so I’m sorry, El Salvador. Next year is going to be ten years of that album, or ten years of Lido Pimienta in music out there. So I should do another version and include El Salvador. So, mental note, but yeah, just music. Where does it come from? It comes from how music heals and how music is always there for me. So, when I put this thing on Myspace, I didn’t know what was going to happen because I just put it out there so that I could continue to be in touch with my friends in Colombia. So, we’re on Myspace. That was the only intention that I had. I came to this country with the sole intention of becoming a visual artist and art curator. I still have this idea of going back and making my own artist-run center or academy, music academy. I still want to do that, but someone heard it on the Myspace, and it happened to be South America’s biggest pop star. That catapulted into, “OK, well now you have to go on tour.” But that was it. It was just an opportunity to be recording music and learning to record myself was just learning about my voice and how I can use my voice. Later, I was introduced to loop pedals and loop stations and drum machines. All of that helped me just expand at least the composition side. When I’m talking introduce, it means a quick search on YouTube. Anupa Mistry Yeah, I was going to ask you what that education comprised… Lido Pimienta Yeah, girl. I didn’t have no time to go to no school for production or nothing like that. Anupa Mistry So you were learning as you were making? Lido Pimienta Yes! Because when baby daddy went back to the States, I moved to Toronto. Because I was living in London, Ontario. I moved to Toronto, and I was like, “Here I am with my kid.” It was tough, right? Because, I had two roommates. It was tough, but it was great too at the same time. The room that I shared with my son was my first music studio. I got a little Novation [keyboard]. I was like, “How do you do this? And how do you do that?” But, always having in the back of my mind, “I need to go back to this, my voice,” because that song, “Humano,” it has so many remixes. I’ve lost count, just so many remixes. I always get, it’s always the Germans, always the Germans. “I made this. I made this remix. I hope you like it.” I’m like, “Publisher, are they paying for this? Let me know. Yes, I love it.” But, yeah, that’s when I learned electronic music is just, you know what? This is cool. I can transform a very beautiful, soft song, and I can take it to all these other places. That really set foot into what would come after, when I moved to Toronto and I met my friends. I met the scene, the electronic scene in Toronto. That’s when I became friends with my friends there. That’s when I was like, “OK, everything is going to be okay.” I met Kvesche Bijons[-Ebacher]. He’s also known as Spawn of Sid and Blake McFarland, Blake Blakely. We started making music together. It was the most special, wonderful moment as a single mother who had a horrible breakup, and thinking that I wasn’t going to be able to make music on my own. That was super great. Then I met Robert Drisdelle. He’s from Halifax. He’s a composer who plays the clarinet. I was like, “Oh, clarinet, I’m going to teach you porro baby.” So, that’s what we did. Then, Brandon Valdivia, he’s in this group. His project is called Mas Aya. He also used different flutes from different countries. All of us got together. We’re really making this. Then, I always admired Prince Nifty. Look up Prince Nifty right now. Go, find him, because his music is amazing. Tenderness was another person that I was like, “I need to learn from these people.” That’s how slowly the sound in La Papessa started building. Me and Nifty would meet way later, but I was still listening to his music, and just, “I need to learn how to make these beats.” So, that’s basically how I was able to survive. I don’t even remember the question, but... Anupa Mistry That’s okay. We can move on to: You mentioned your voice being kind of this... I guess it is the foundation of the sound. But it being [also] kind of a way for you to kind of reach into other genres, by laying out this simple, beautiful, vocal track. Can you talk a little bit about how you approach the vocals in your music because you’ve got... First of all, you use a lot of repetition and you’re using the looper, you’ve got these different harmonies. What’s your approach to kind of creating the vocal soundscape for your music? Lido Pimienta Well, Colombian music and the one that I particularly am drawn to the most, which is in the cumbia, tambura, bullerengue and sexteto realm, it’s all about call and response. When people talk about tribal music, well this is the deal. Call and response is this thing of respect and it’s also the thing of including everyone in the song. Making everyone feel like they have a say. I’m all about that. Palmas, just clapping and repeating a phrase. It’s like you enter this trance. That’s why I love it. When I was introduced to this – again, you have to research – the pedal I use, I was like, “OK, very cool. I can have a group of people made of myself.” When I started working with the loop pedal, I didn’t really have friends that I could sing with. My voice had to do it, and even one of the songs that I did for the first album, I wanted this big choir. I sent out this email to the local musicians and no one paid attention to it. Then, when we put it online it had hundreds of thousands of streams in the first three hours or whatever. I was like, “Well, I guess my voice is enough then.” Opportunities like that, when someone says no, you still go for it. When someone doesn’t believe in you, you still do it. When someone tells you that’s weird, well guess what? There’s a lot of weird people out there that are gonna like it and I’m gonna make my coin anyways, thank you. With that rhetoric, I’ve been able to live in a very expensive-ass city and have two kids, you know what I’m saying? That’s just where it came from. I have a strong voice. Not only am I loud, I love to talk about myself, but I also like when people are listening. Then that is my opportunity to bring us together because sh-t is f---ed up. There was a horrible terrorist white supremacist attack yesterday in New Zealand. That sh-t happened here in Montréal and it’s like we have selective memory. It’s like, “It’s not happening. I’m gonna buy the new Yeezys.” Believe me, I love me some shoes. I love that sh-t, but I also want my kids to have a future. I don’t wanna be afraid when I walk down the street. I have to use my voice. If I don’t use my... Then what am I doing? Because if I just wanna make money, then that would be even easier for me because [puts on soft voice], “I can just talk like this and...” Anupa Mistry Put on the J-Lo dress. Lido Pimienta [speaks with Latina accent] “Just talk really Latina because being Latina…” And really work in that fetish that Latin women have and use that to my advantage. I have no problem with taking money from people that are fetishizing me. I have no problem with doing that, but at the same time, there’s enough of that. Of what is expected of me as a Latin American, Colombian. There’s enough of that, so I just do whatever I like. Seems to be working, let’s see how far I can go. Anupa Mistry Let’s listen to a track that I think pulls in some of this personal narrative that I think you’re talking about here. It’s from La Pepessa, which is your second album and it’s called “La Capacidad.” (music: Lido Pimienta – “La Capacidad” / applause) “La Capacidad.” I feel like we can hear all of those things we were just talking about in that. The repetition, the stacking of the vocals. But do you want to tell us a little bit about what that track is about and why it was important for you to... It’s a centerpiece of your performance I feel. Lido Pimienta If you ever go to a Lido Pimienta show, it’s a little bit of this, a little bit of that. A little bit of stand-up comedy, because I’m always like, if the album doesn’t work out I will try stand-up. If that doesn’t work out, then I will try to be a cartoon voice. If that doesn’t work out, I will move back to Colombia and I’ll just teach English. I have it all... You need a lot... I’m a Virgo. Anyways... Anupa Mistry You’re a woman with a plan. Lido Pimienta After big daddy number one, I met who I thought was the best man in the world because he wasn’t an artist. That’s it. The qualification where: Don’t be a musician. You’re the best. This guy wasn’t a musician, although in his head he was. Electronic musician. We were dating and everything was nice, but then it wasn’t nice. I had to break up with him because he became very violent and controlling and that just wasn’t a good look. I broke up with him, but then he didn’t wanna break up. He started sending me all these terrible messages and one of the messages was, “If you don’t come back to me, I will put naked photos of you online.” New to Canada, I didn’t really have a community and the few friends that I did have were my white friends that they’re, “Go to the police.” It’s like, “I can’t explain to you how that’s not gonna work for me.” I did everything that I could to not have this guy harass me and I had to call my mom. I called my mom because she would know what to do. She was like [puts on voice], “Let me give this guy a call. I got you girl.” She was like, “Hello, Ryan. I am the mother of Lido Pimienta, Rosario Pasquez. How are you?” He was like, “Yeah, your daughter, blah, blah, blah.” And she’s like, “Well she tell me you want to put the naked picture in the internet. Put the naked picture in the internet right now. When it happened to Kim Kardashian, she became a millionaire. I don’t want to work in the factory anymore, so please put the picture in the internet.” He called me back and he was like, “Your mother is crazy and you’re crazy. I don’t even want to be with you in the first place.” Mixed messages. Because right after, a man sends you a picture of himself crying. Like what do I believe? Your tears or your angry voice? I just wrote that song and that’s the story. Anupa Mistry That’s a great story. I know you’ve told it a million times, but you know... Lido Pimienta Never tired of telling it. F--- you motherf---er. [laughter] Anupa Mistry You are a Canadian musician. You’re winning Canadian prizes, [Lido makes air quotes] Canadian, collaborating with a nice range of Canadian… Lido Pimienta [puts thumbs up] I love the Canadian government! [laughter] Anupa Mistry You’ve collaborated with, I think, a nice range of Canadian artists actually. Something that’s quite interesting to me is the types of people you’ve been able to connect with: Austra, Shad, Narcy, Tribe Called Red. Have you collaborated with Tanya Tagaq or are you just friends? [Lido nods] OK, collaborated with Tanya, Sidani. Lido Pimienta Witch Prophet. Anupa Mistry Witch Prophet. But you’re also making music that I think for many people scans as quite Colombian. You’re singing in Spanish and I’m not so interested in why you choose to sing in Spanish, clearly you’re comfortable singing in Spanish and that’s fine, but what have you experienced playing this music out, playing shows in non-Spanish speaking communities and cities. How are people listening to that music? How are they receiving it and what does that tell you about the way people respond to your music? Lido Pimienta I think that people don’t mind... I mean, the States is no problem, everyone there speaks Spanish. If you don’t, you speak it by association. In Canada, I’m just fresh, I’m lit. I bring something exciting and people are into it and I’m very vocal and it’s exciting to be a part of whatever I do. I wish I could write a song in English. I wish, but the stuff that comes out is sad. I think that’s what it is. I have this line since, I don’t know, like ten years ago. It’s like [stands up and sings], “Interior design for brain-washing facilities.” That sh-t is sad, right? Then, I was like, “No. I’m gonna write a song in English!” I was like [sings], “I’ve hit an all-time low. I’ve hit an all-time low.” I don’t have the look for that kind of music. That would be confusing. My sh-t is like, “Hey! Hello!” It’s a brand thing. [laughter] If I do the songs in English because I want to tap into that coin, I do. It just don’t come out. Also, the kind of stuff that I write are very cerebral because I like the music to be non-complicated. I like the music to be fun. I want everyone to be able to play it. I want everyone to remember it. I don’t do like: Now the syncopation is gonna start here and then it’s gonna go there and then I’m gonna do this complicated... No, that’s not what I do. But the songs are a lot of nuance, a lot of poetry. They’re very dark and somber, but it’s always like Colombian music. Colombian music and Colombian dance is all about mocking the slave master. Like Son de Negro, for example, is this dance where the dancers are making this crazy movement and they’re making these weird faces the entire time because they’re mocking, but they’re not saying, “F--- you, slave master.” They’re saying, “We’re having so much fun here by the fire singing our song.” The slave master is just like, “Oh, there are those slaves just at it again with their noise, their bullerengue.” Bullerengue means loud noise like “boo-ya.” That was it, it’s just like let’s just do our thing without telling you, but I’m still gonna do whatever I want. That’s what I do. It’s almost like a secret, but also in this landscape, people are open to listening to music in other languages that are not English. But trust the English record is coming. Trust. Anupa Mistry You’ve got a little bit of English here and there on your new record, which we’ll talk about in a bit. I think there are also probably some people in this room, and people watching, who might speak a language other than English, maybe are contemplating making music in a language other than English. What have you learned about the utility and the viability of making Spanish language music in a predominantly non-Spanish speaking language market? Lido Pimienta Haven’t thought about it that much, other than sometimes I’ll mess up the lyrics, like no one’s gonna know. I’m more confident when I do it, which means that the performance is better. It’s more true to who I am. It’s always good. If you’re pretending to be something that you’re not and someone that you’re not, the commitment to that has to be great so that you don’t slip. If you’re gonna create this persona, be 100,000% committed to that. Because this persona is myself, I don’t really have to think about it because it’s just what I do. I’m singing in Spanish just happens to be... It’s not like I am so proud to represent the Spanish language. I’m not Spanish. I’m not. Spain is the boogeyman too. It’s another colonizer language. What I want to do is that I want to do an album in Wayuunaiki, the language of my people, the Wayuu. [points to bag] This is our stuff. The music will look like this, sound like this. That is what I want to do, but first I’ve got to learn my way. I’ve got to experiment. I also don’t have the time that I used to have before having children. I have to be very intentional with the things that I do. I have to be very organized in the things that I do because I have to... I only have a two-hour slot after the baby goes to sleep before I get tired. I have to make sure that I have enough time for my son that’s growing up in this world and he has the, “What happens after you die?” questions, but he also has the questions about like, “What is birth control?” I have to... Anupa Mistry Be a mom. Lido Pimienta Yeah, I have to be a mother. I cannot wait until he turns 12, so he can learn about birth control, but right now it’s all about experimenting, but at the same time knowing who I am. I actually feel very grateful that I came to live in this new reality at 19 and not at seven, not at four. I’m able to go every year, I’m keeping up with this link. I’m a part of my community and it’s ever-changing. I’m showing you that it can be done. Anything, with a nice calendar and saving up and not spending money on stupid sh-t that you don’t need, you’ll be able to at least have a good record that’s gonna sound decent on whatever, the speakers from the laptop. Anupa Mistry I think it sounds a little better than that. Speaking of slaying, let’s hear a track that connects you back to your home, but also connects to me, [points to t-shirt] the number one Rihanna fan. This is a rework of a very well-known Rihanna song and you called your version “Camellando.” Let’s listen to that. (music: Lido Pimienta – “Camellando” / applause) That was your song “Camellando,” which is a rework of Rihanna’s “Work.” What can you tell... I like the story of what this song is about. I think it’s important. Lido Pimienta It is very important because every major song, every major name, Katy Perry, all those major whatever songs, people will cover them. This song was, I feel like there’s probably a Guinness Record on how many times this song was reworked. The infamous cover of the woman that was like, “I am going to sing it so that everyone can understand it because Rihanna is just singing gibberish.” I was like, “What? Let me see who’s doing one in Spanish.” And then I was looking at the ones that were done in Spanish, and they were not good. People were translating the words because… There’s one thing is a translation, another thing is an interpretation. For those of us who speak more than one language, we understand that it just doesn’t work if you translate word by word. One of the covers, the guy was singing, “Ación, ación, ación,” as in, “Work, work, work.” Like, “Action, action, action.” The adjective, it’s just like... He was trying to do it in this romantic way, just like soft light and like, “Ación, ación, ación. Llegó a tener el control.” Horrible. Then I saw another one and it was terrible. I was just like, “I got to represent!” I went to my buddy’s studio, Josh Cole. He’s a great bassist based in Toronto. He has this nice studio and I was like, “Let me just put the track.” Then I did “Camellando.” Camellando means working. That’s a slang for work. When you say, “I’m at work.” You say, “Esto en el camello,” camello means camel. I don’t know why we say that, but that’s what we say in Barranquilla. “You’re riding your camel on my camel.” Maybe it’s because riding a camel is hard and you’re working hard? I don’t know, but that’s what we say. I just did my interpretation of what the song was about, that to me was emotional labor. I was drawing from a lot of street here. Street food is very regulated. It’s like, food truck, here’s the food truck area for an authentic shawarma. This regulated, FDA approved. Colombia, we don’t got no regulation for nothing. You see a woman in the street with oil from three months ago frying up the fries or whatever with her three kids. The older kid will be the one taking the deliveries. Before Uber Eats there were Colombian children taking food to your door. We just don’t have the technology to profit from that app. Yeah, so that’s where the song came from. Then, I put it out, went to sleep, woke up and it’s like, “Woah, Lido Pimienta’s comeback.” I’m like, “Are you kidding me?” I don’t want this kind of attention for someone else’s song, but I took advantage of it. I rode that wave. It was cool. It was just like, “Oh yeah, I should use my SoundCloud more often.” Actually, I should because Branko emailed me about being in his album and I didn’t see it [until] like six months later. Then, I’m like, “Yeah, I have this new record. You should be on it.” I’m just like, “Yeah, totally! Wait, I’m about to give birth. Let’s try the next one.” Lesson, check your SoundCloud inbox. It’s not just sex invitations. There’s some good... [laughter] Anyways. Anupa Mistry Sounds so polite, a sex invitation. Lido Pimienta Yeah. I support sex work. Anupa Mistry I’m glad you brought up emotional labor and one of the things I appreciate about you so much, I don’t really know very many women in my life and I know a lot of strong, talented, busy women, but you really live all aspects of your womanhood I think. If… Your baby who’s here, shout out baby, if she needed you, you might bring her up here. Lido Pimienta My kid is the best. Anupa Mistry It’s not easy for women to be an artist or journalist or whatever the case may be and then also be these other things. How has your art... Or maybe it’s not your art. How have you... I hate the question where do you get your confidence from, but how do you find a way of living so fully like that? It’s not easy. Lido Pimienta Well, I always say carry a calendar, just write the stuff down that you have to do. Really visualize how you want to see yourself, put it out in the universe. It’s very important. To me, I don’t surround myself with people that are not creative. I don’t waste my time sharing my gift with people that are only there to take them from me. I don’t waste my time with having people around who have no ambition, who have no morals, who have no focus. I don’t hang out with people that are just there to hang out. No, if we’re going to hang out, then I’m going to need you to please take the garbage downstairs while I finish this song. A lot of us, growing up with... I didn’t grow up with Instagram. I may look it, but I come from a generation that if you wanted something, you really needed to go get it. It wasn’t like… now it’s this era of influencers and all this stuff, but even influencers which, their careers are purely based on their aesthetic, they still have to think about their looks. They still have to have this discipline and that’s how you’re going to see the results. For me, it’s like I have to surround myself with friends that can take care of kids, that are confident, and that believe in me so when I go on tour and I have to leave my son for two weeks, I’m not worried. That only happens if you really build those relationships with people that are there for you. A lot of my friendships that are no longer, people that are no longer in my life is... We had to break up because my success or my ambition was something that they weren’t cool with. They’re not cool with it because it’s like, “Well, what about me?” It’s just like, “Well, I’m here for you. We can do it together,” but people don’t want to do anything together. People want to be the number one. I wanna have my kids. I had my son when I was 21. I wanted to have my son when I was 20 because I had this vision, when I’m 40 my son’s going to play the piano, I’m going to keep it in the family. That’s just what has to happen, but I had him when I was 21 and I was like, “Well, it’s close to 20, it’s fine.” Then, I was like, “OK, I have this tour. Then, at this moment I’m gonna finish the album. Then, I’m gonna start the tour over here, but then the baby’s gonna be a year old. If I have her this month, she’ll be a year old and then I’ll be able to go on tour.” That’s exactly what I did. I told baby daddy number two, “You better get me pregnant because it has to happen before 2017 because the album has to be...” I just have to organize and have control of my body, really know what’s happening with my body, really download all the tracking period apps and learn what is a vagina. What? Really understand yourself. If you do want to have kids in the industry, in any industry, if you want to have your baby daddy next to you or a partner, this partner has to be 100,000% with you being the star of the show. Baby daddy number two is all about that. He’s like, “Yes, girl. Yes, become rich so that I don’t gotta work. Girl, yes.” Well, that’s not what he does, but he’s there for me and I’m there for him. We really are a team. Just like my team, my management, they’re awesome and they really help me in the things that I want to do and I always have a wild idea after another and you need people to tell you, “Yes. This is awesome.” Instead of, “Really?” When people start saying that to you, cut. I always say that. The second thing that I say, “If you take a group photo and they post it and they look great and you look a mess, you got to cut those people off your...” Cut, because that’s a really simple way of knowing if they care about you or not. In this era, where you can find your next life-long partner on the Instagram and now the opportunity is over because you look a mess? You got to cut, ta-ta-ta. That’s how I’m able to do it. I am very organized and I know exactly what I want and I know exactly how I’m gonna get it. I come from a place where people don’t have opportunities because what opportunities can you have when there’s no running water? We got it good. We got it so good, so why are you spending whatever, $400 a week in weed? Why? Justify it to me. Kurt Cobain started smashing guitars after he had money. When he didn’t have money, he took care of those guitars. That’s how he did it. Then, he became really rich and he’s like, “Give me ten guitars. I’m gonna smash them on this tour.” Fine, but right now it’s like be very careful with your money and the people around you because we do, as artists, producers, dancers, writers, whatever, we are cultural. We hold this cultural power. We need to be able to use it so that we can grow, so that that cultural power grows. You decide what you want to do with it, but whatever that is what you want to do, you’ve got to put it in your mood board. You got to put it in the mood board and surround yourself with people that will be there for that, for that vision. Anupa Mistry Part of what surrounds you is your actual family, your children, your partner, very close friends. I really like that about you. You don’t have this very sealed off artist life where you’re just around other artists and it’s very industry and this, that and the other. Your baby goes wherever you need to go, but for people who are not a parent or maybe who don’t want to be a parent, I still think that there’s something you can pull here when it comes to community. You’ve talked about it a bit, but maybe just, what is the value of a community? It doesn’t just have to be people who will come to your show or people who will play on your track. Beyond that, how can community help people in this room and people who are watching, build their careers? Lido Pimienta My community are my comadres. Just a bunch of women that have been there for me since I moved to this place. We all have a lot of ambition. We all help each other get to where we want to go. I think it’s really good when people say, “I don’t want to have kids,” because there’s a lot of us in the world already. I think a lot of people fantasize to this idea of parenthood or motherhood. I think that’s really great. It’s all about that own ambition and your vision of who you want to be or who you are. The children thing will come, when you’re ready. I need my community to tell me when I’m doing something f---ed up. Friends are not just people that are telling you how amazing you are all the time. I don’t have a lot of industry people around me. Unfortunately, when I’ve met some of my heroes and sheroes in the industry, I get wildly disappointed. Especially people that are surrounded by material wealth. People that don’t have the material wealth want that wealth for themselves. You get this culture of leeches, that just want to be a part of that, because artists, ’cause we are narcissists, because we are very weak emotionally, because a lot of us have been rejected by family members, ‘specially if you’re queer or trans or you’re gay or lesbian, a lot of us have that story. That backstory of, “Oh well, my parents love me. I just can’t come over for Christmas.” Everyone has that story. When we find people that are telling us we’re wonderful, fabulous, amazing, it’s dangerous too. I have people, I have my friends that will be, “Oh girl, your edges are busted!” I need that. I need that because I’m not super woman. I don’t have super powers. That’s why you have friends, so that they can tell you, “You’re f---ing up,” or, “I support you in your whole journey, but this guy, this guy, they’re no good for you girl and here are the receipts.” You need that in your life. You need that to protect yourself and protect one another. If I start accepting all of these new friendships, and when people come to me and they’re overly like, “Oh my God, I really...” Crying and stuff, I’m just, I shouldn’t have that reaction because you don’t know me. That is something that kids starting in this industry game… don’t let yourself be fooled, and think that everyone has your best interest in mind. I started when I was very young. When I released that first album, because of my being so naive and thinking that everyone had the best intentions for me, I had labels completely taking advantage of me. I’ve written songs that have been taken from me, that have won Latin Grammys. I’ve had people just straight up, in my house talking and being interviewed and saying very smart things that sound exactly like what I said in my living room two days ago. You know? Stuff like that, you have to be very careful with who you let or allow in your personal space. You have to really protect yourself. It’s a very desperate thing. Music is a beautiful thing, but the business of it is desperate. Everyone wants to have that number one. Everyone wants to be going on tour and have lavish proximity to Kylie Jenner or whatever. That’s not how the world works. This is still a business. You still have this cultural power that you need to really protect. See it as the ring. This is the motherf---ing ring. This is your f---ing precious. You know what I’m saying? You need that sh-t. You can’t just let anyone and you know Frodo here with the stinking feet up in here. No! That’s what I mean. That’s why community is important. Have real, only real people by your side. I started with a big group, and now they’re getting smaller and smaller and smaller. Girls, Survivor, the Island, it’s less of us. It’s okay because I love them. I hope you’re watching, because I’m watching you too. Anupa Mistry You are signed to Anti- Records now. That happened after you won the Polaris prize in 2017? I think that’s a goal of many musicians, right? To make music, then potentially you can have the support of a label. You were very DIY, before that. Can you talk a little bit about what signing to the label changed for you? Just in terms of your artistic process. [Lido pulls out a record from behind her] Here we go, upside down. They recently gave this record. Lido Pimienta Let’s open it. I don’t have any nails. Anupa Mistry I do. Lido Pimienta I’ll talk about Anti-. For all of us based in this country, we will notice that things move a little slower. Our music industry too is the not-as-hot cousin for the States. The US is super-hot and successful, has it all together, bad-ass bitch. Canada is the cousin that just got her braces removed and her confidence is just starting to blossom. She just discovered what a tampon is and she’s like, “Woo!” The US like has been using the cup for a long time. She’s so cool. Not even the cup, the sponge, you know. We’re still, still with the tampon. I don’t know if that made any sense, so... Anupa Mistry That’s the best analogy for the Canadian music industry I’ve ever heard. [laughter / applause] Lido Pimienta I’m not going to name any names, because I don’t want to get in trouble. I’ve had all this courtship from booking agencies and labels and whatever in Canada. It never really set, never really. It all stayed in emails and nice conversations at the shows. I remember one of the shows. We opened for Sampha. All these music industry people were there. “We have to bring you to the office. You’re amazing.” “Yeah, bring me to the office. Where do I go, where is that?” Nothing. But, I would hear from other people in the industry that loved me. They were like, “Oh girl, guess who called me and asked if you are cool or not.” Are you trying to tell me that if someone is looking at an artist, they have to check if they’re cool enough to be signed or co-signed or put their money where their f---ing mouth is? It’s f---ed up. After the Polaris thing and I got management... Polaris was September 2017. I got management in May, 2017. Up until then, I had different online personas, that were my manager. Until I found them and they realized all of these people that I’m interacting with and all the things that I’m doing, they really helped me organize or help manage it. Really great. One of them, I knew for many years, Rachel. I was like great, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. We go to LA. They put me in this industry, whatever thing. I kid you not. It took me half an hour, opening for all these shitty bands, to get Anti- and all these other industry people actually, “Here is what we can offer you.” For the last ten years living in this country. Right? People there will take a risk. I don’t need to convince myself that you’re a bad ass bitch or that you’re a good performer, a good musician or good singer. I’m seeing it with my own eyes, right here. I see the people reacting to you. Let’s do it. Come to the office. I went. That week, I went to all these places and Anti- were the people that were more real with me. That’s why I went with them. ’Cause they were, “Well, what can we do to work with you?” I was like, “Well I don’t want my bandmates to have to work for a whole year so that they can help me finish my record and perform it.” “OK. Good.” Then, the contracts are happening. Here’s some money that we can give you. I want more. That part of the negotiation, you need your lawyers and all that stuff. The training, pre-label, pre-industry starts with not surrounding yourself with shitty people. If you’re surrounded by shitty people that are only there to take from you, you are not going to know how to read a contract properly. The label will take advantage of you. They will exploit you. Anupa Mistry I think there’s a lot of things that people don’t ask for, though. They’re scared of it going away. You were okay being like, “No, my band needs to not, needs to be okay.” Lido Pimienta I don’t want people telling me or giving me a deadline. These are the numbers of records that I want affiliated. If you want me to do six albums, I’m actually gonna give you three. OK? The first one is going to be a reissue of the one that I just released. [takes record] This is the one that I won the Polaris for, it’s La Papessa. I reissue it with new art, that I made myself, a pretty picture. I was nine months pregnant here, look at this. I was like, “Yeah I am going to do this.” The guy that runs the label, really has this spiritual connection to me. We have really great conversations. I was just, “Oh you really love me. OK, this is good.” This is good for me, because I need to know that you actually care about me. Because why? When the tour happens, if I have to open for a huge star or whatever and I tell them, “I need you to help me with this tour because I need to bring two nannies,” they’re going to help you. You have to look and think about it, not in the moment, now. I’m going to take a picture of Instagram with me signing this contract. No, you have to think about two years into your contract, when you have a product. I knew that when I saw myself in two years into it, it was going to be good because they were really taking care of me. They were treating me like a person, not like this product. We did seven shows at South by Southwest, last year, pregnant. At every single show, the record was there. The label was there, at every single show. They were, “How can we help you? We’re here.” They’re based in LA, they don’t need to be in Austin for nothing, but they were there. I was just, we were still courting. I’m like, “Oh, OK.” And you test people. To me, it just worked out. Just really get you a lawyer, when those contracts happen and be very sure of what you want. I’m someone that is extremely involved in my creative process. All the videos, all the whatever, any campaign, you best believe that I’m going to be behind all of it. They were, “That is exactly what we want. We waste a lot of time coming up with concepts and stuff for a lot of artists. We don’t have to do it with you. We’re actually very excited to work with someone like that.” Whereas other people, they’re not into it. They really want to tell you how to put the product out there. Some artists, they grow frustrated. A lot of artists are, well that record was really good. I don’t know what happened to them. A lot of these people, that you don’t ever hear from again, is because you get really disappointed once you enter these arenas. I don’t need to do stuff just ’cause. I can take my time. Now, I am taking my time. The record is sounding amazing. That’s exactly what I wanted. It’s happening and I hope that people receive it well. I don’t know. Anupa Mistry Let’s listen to something from Miss Colombia. I was telling you, I have a really hard time picking what song to play because... Lido Pimienta Because they’re all great. Anupa Mistry They are all great. We’re going to play “Para Transcribio.” [Lido says something off mic] Oh yeah, sorry. We can do that one. No problem. What’s it called? Tell me again. Lido Pimienta “Eso que tu haces,” which means, “that thing you do.” (music: Lido Pimienta – “Eso Que Tu Haces” / applause) Anupa Mistry So you’re saying... yeah, that’s not the right version. Lido Pimienta It’s not the most recent, but it’s okay. Anupa Mistry This record is not coming out until later this year. This is a sneak peek. Talk about this new record. You do have a concept for it, it’s called Miss Colombia. I’m also curious to know what you’re doing musically, on this record that maybe you haven’t done before. Lido Pimienta When I first started writing this album was in 2016, 2016 in the fall, in October, I went to Santiago, Chile, in Chile to work on Miss Colombia. I had all these songs. I had many versions of it. I had like a bunch of... The versions were all voice and woodwinds and brass. I went to Andrés Nusser’s studio. He’s this Chilean guy behind this band called Astro. He had just stopped Astro. He was, “Yeah, just come over and let’s make some music.” That’s when Miss Colombia started. When we were in the studio working on Miss Colombia, I was like, “Oh I forgot to put the album out there.” La Papessa. I just put it out there and I forgot about it. I was, “Goodbye La Papessa. I’m into Miss Colombia now.” So it was this nice experience where I’m just in Chile arranging the pre-demos of that. That’s the week that I contacted Nifty, Prince Nifty or Matt Smith in Toronto. I was like, “You should come for a couple of weeks and see how you feel the songs.” That’s how I started. Upon returning to Toronto, and people liked the album, I was like, “I guess I got to go on tour now.” Got the short list and the whatever, and I had to stop. I always knew that Miss Colombia was going to be a revisit of those songs, like “Chumbacu,” lots of clarinet, lots of porro, lots of repetition. Musically, the things that have influenced me. It’s my album where I go back to my country after being told, by all the white supremacists, to go back to my country. I was like, “Yes, I’ll go then. I’m going to make gold.” That’s exactly what I am doing. I started reconnecting with the traditional groups that I grew up listening to. I started reconnecting with the singing that formed me as a singer. That was singing in the streets, singing in Carnival. Projecting without a microphone or without a PA. Projecting in the middle of the street with 5,000 people here and 5,000 people here. Watching you. How do you project for hundreds of people with your voice? I need to remember that because the snow and the weather really weighs you down. I needed that injection of life. Going to Colombia to me is always this sour thing. It’s beautiful, but it’s also really hard. It’s happy, but it’s also very sad. Especially, with what’s happening with Venezuela and how we’re getting this influx of very talented, very amazing Venezuelans, that now are selling candy in the streets or working for very, very, very, very cheap, and Colombia really exploiting that. The fear of not becoming Venezuela is what made the government be what it is now. All of these things, there is so much material here. I really need to start looking at myself. In terms of sound, all those are the elements. My favorite was going to San Basilio de Palenque, which is the first free town from slavery in all of the Americas, the home to many singers. If the people here have ever heard remixes of Colombian music, you’ve heard of the singers. Only that the singers are living in poverty, living in houses that are falling apart, if they have a house. The singers like, they will be selling their candy in the street. This group that I grew up with, called Sexteto Tabalá, they’ve been a group for almost a hundred years. It goes from generation to generation of these family members. It’s tradition. Their oldest member and their main singer and songwriter, his name is Raphael Cassiani Cassiani, he’s 89 years old. He doesn’t have a pension. Even though he has written so many songs that we hear over and over again, not just in Carnival, but in the Afro-Colombian diaspora. Because they’ve given me so much, I’m going to go make a song with them.
Miss Colombia has become, not just a record, it’s a language, it’s a study, it’s a thesis, it’s my PhD. I hate academia. But, if that was the route that I would have taken, had I let my teachers convince me when I was in university, this is the work that I would be doing. No, we have to make sure that this traditional music is compensated. We have to make sure that this traditional music keeps living on. That Colombian traditional music lives on properly, properly archived, properly, not like what happens now. If you want the really good archival content, you have to go to France. Go to the vault in France. Just like African artifacts are in London. Gold stolen from indigenous people all over the Americas, is in England. It’s the same with music. If we don’t start looking at music as this precious, one-of-a-kind important works, we’re not going to move forward. Because the canon, why is a f---ing Picasso protected but not a f---ing Sexteto Tabalá song. The canon needs to change. There has to be a shift in what we see as the canon in arts and culture. Picasso ripped off African cultures for years, everyone knows that. Anupa Mistry There was a show about that in Montréal. Lido Pimienta I don’t know. That’s what it is. It’s like Modigliani, the same, all these motherf---ers. So anyways, we should play this song. Anupa Mistry Should we play a Sexteto song? Lido Pimienta Well, whatever you want… Anupa Mistry Should we play one of their songs? Lido Pimienta One of their songs, yeah, even though... Anupa Mistry Now I feel bad pressing play. Lido Pimienta It’s okay because they are gonna get paid, boo. Anupa Mistry OK. Lido Pimienta Here’s Sexteto Tabalá from San Basilio de Palenque. (music: Sexteto Tabalá – “Agua” / applause) Anupa Mistry So that was “Agua” by Sexteto Tabalá and so now we’ll listen to the track that you recorded with them and we’ll hear the donkeys in the background and the truck rumbling by. Introduce this song because… Lido Pimienta “Quiero Que Me Salves.” Anupa Mistry And sneak peak from Miss Colombia. (music: Lido Pimienta and Sexteto Tabalá – “Quiero Que Me Salves” / applause) Why are you laughing? Lido Pimienta I laugh because all I can hear is they’re not in the right pitch but it’s okay. But it’s great. It’s beautiful. Anupa Mistry Thank you. Thank you for being here and sharing your new music and giving us language and space to talk about ways to be better people in the world. I appreciate it. Thank you Lido Pimienta. [applause] Let’s do some questions. I can pass the mic, but questions? Lido Pimienta Also a shout out to my baby. Seven months old. Anupa Mistry Where is she? Lido Pimienta Behaving better than all of you. Audience member Hi Lido, just wanted to say thank you so much for speaking to us. That was very insightful. I want to ask you a question that I think about a lot myself as somebody who looks into my music and music from my culture and I’m incorporating that in my music. A lot of what you said today was getting my gears going about that, and it’s a tough question and it’s something I think about. I always feel so many different ways about this. I don’t think there is a particularly right answer, so it is a very tough question. Maybe an ambiguous answer. Me being a first-generation immigrant but never grew up where I am from, which is Bangladesh. My parents live there but I grew up outside of that. So with that comes a degree of maybe privilege that maybe other 25-year-olds or children in Bangladesh don’t get to have. So I see that as a way that... It might be different, my perspective of how I see things. In playing classical Indian music through my family, my mom and my brother and myself, and now that I’m incorporating this in my music, I’m not making any money per se really but I want to be able to at least bring an understanding of where this music comes from, what it represents, and be able to offer that. Is that enough? Or what can we do to... I guess when you don’t really have money, when you’re trying to figure out how you’re gonna make your rent at the end of the month, because I can’t ask my mom for money, that’s for sure. Single mother. That’s how it is. When I put instruments from my culture in my music but I don’t really see any money out of it... But how can I help the people through this when I’m currently not really in a position outside of just being able to direct them to resources or just talk to them about what this is, where it comes from, how it was made, etc? Lido Pimienta OK. Audience member Do you know where I’m coming from here? Lido Pimienta Yeah. I mean, this is the album number three and the first time that I’ve had support for one of my records. So I’ve had this idea of working with Sexteto Tabalá for the last ten years but I needed to wait until the time was right that I could go back and be with them... I mean, I’ve known them since I was 13 years old, right? So I actually had a relationship with them, so I was able to confidently be in the community and I brought money. I saved up for it. I put it in the budget and that’s what I did. If I put myself in your shoes, what I see is a man from Bangladesh. When you look at yourself in the mirror, you’re not a white kid. You’re not a Canadian kid, so you still have to be in the world existing in your skin, so there’s still a lot of things or a lot of doors that won’t just open for you, so you have to... Don’t, like, “I’m just a martyr and I don’t know what to do and I want to use my culture but I also don’t want to exploit it.” No, because it is who you are, right? So you have to learn. You have to learn. Save up, take a trip… Audience member It is a part of... Sorry to interrupt you. It is a part of who I am but it is not all that I am, which I also understand. Lido Pimienta Exactly. For sure, because this is who we are. I lived in the city all my life. I didn’t live in the desert. I went there and it was a part of my experience growing up, but I can tell you more Nickelodeon shows than I can tell you in traditional Wayuu songs, right? So that’s how Lido Pimienta exists. I am not waving the flag of anything but myself, and when you get to the point where you can make coin from your music, you will know how you’re going to find the ways and it might be that you’re going to go down there and you’re going to sample the musicians and you’re going to pay them, give them the money and you’re going to create an account so that anything that comes, you’re going to share with them. A lot of us, like my close friends, like this amazing producer, musician called Chancha Vía Circuito, he goes a lot into the jungle and works with indigenous people in the south of South America and that’s what he does. It’s all about the context. It’s all about doing what you’re supposed to be doing, not just taking. But also, if you’re just starting out and you’re experimenting with samples and you’re not making money, it’s fine, because you are discovering yourself. You are finding out who you are and it’s only going to happen through trial and error. So if I were you, I wouldn’t really hit myself too hard in the head because you’re walking your path, you’re living your truth and you are... We’re born here, you live here, but your culture is who you are. Your mother, your relatives, so yeah, I would recommend... I just went back and I discovered all this whole new set of family that I had no idea that existed and I go to their house and they all happen to be bullerengue singers. Now I understand a lot of why I sing the way that I sing. So, you will be surprised and you will find the ways that you’re going to help your community and have them, and it’s also like, “Help my community because I am the...” No, it’s like participate in the community, collaborate with your community, because let me tell you, these people in these communities where they are oppressed and live in these oppressed communities and governments and corruption and all that stuff, their music is better than ours, their talents are better than ours, their music is better, everything they do is better. So it’s just like, I’m just trying to be like them. I’m just trying to be like Sexteto and make every single song that they have amazing with the smallest elements, you know? So, yeah. You’re doing it. You’re doing it. You’re doing it. Audience member Thank you for answering this really hard question. Big ups. Lido Pimienta It’s not that hard. Anupa Mistry Maybe if anyone else has a question, you just pass the mic around. Yeah. Audience member I just want to hear more about your experience as a mother and how do you turn that switch on and off as an artist? Being on stage, and at home and you’re yelling at your kids, and how much pros and cons that had impact on your career and if your family’s your source of your inspiration as an artist? Lido Pimienta I don’t really scream at my son. I throw chanclas at him. You know what a chancla is? It’s a flip-flop. So let’s get that straight. I am an artist that happens to be a mother, first and foremost. I happen to be a mother and I f---ing love kids. I love my kids. I’m helping raise my nephew. I love it. It’s a part of who I am and it gives me a lot of inspiration because I love also to be a woman, and I am very lucky that I grew up as a cis-gendered bitch. I love it, I love it. Because of that, it’s not like I have to turn it on and off. I just continue being my truest self because I really love it, you know? The things that I do, now that... When we start touring, what’s going to happen is that my manager is going to be side stage with the baby in the stroller and the baby’s going to be with her protective headphones on and she’s probably going to be eating a chocolate bar. That’s the only thing that worries me is I’m going to have to bribe my baby. It’s like yes, you could have breast milk but look at this Snickers bar. You know? That’s the only thing that I really have to worry about, because I’ve been a mother since I was 21 years old, so I’ve been doing this, and you figure it out as you go. My situation is different than your situation. If you ever have kids that you have to bring on tour or whatever, you’re going to see what your situation is going to be better and then, again, this idea of friends, one of my best friends, Jennifer Arango, she’s an amazing doula. She was my doula. So when the money’s there, like some shows that I’ve done in LA since giving birth, I bring her with me because the money was good, so it’s like, “OK, cool.” And even if the money wasn’t good, you prioritize on the expenses and you bring it into the expenses that you need. In your expenses is daycare, childcare, so you bring in your friend, you hook up your friend and you have peace of mind, because sometimes my son, he’s over the shows. He’s over it. He’s just like, “You know what? I think people want to listen to me now.” We have this very strange relationship, you guys. Anyways, so, he doesn’t like to come on tour. So he likes to stay home. He likes to stay home and we FaceTime every day, so now we’ll see what kind of baby I’m gonna have, and I was very... You know what? I can have a career as a musician onstage, perform, but if I have this baby and this baby’s not into it, I might just write songs for other people, and you can still make a living out of that. For me, it’s not about, “I have to be seen.” For me it’s about I have to put the music out there. I just have to put it out there and I will be happy just putting this stuff online or writing for other musicians because I still have to make a living, but yeah, if you’re planning on it, just know that it is possible just as long as you let the venues know too. I feel like we have a responsibility, men and women, to normalize parenthood and motherhood. We have to normalize it. We have to make sure... We are the ones that are making these venues money. It’s us, right? We bring people to the party and they will buy the beers and whatever, so the least that they can do is that they can have a decent green room where you can bring your mom and your mom’s there with your kids while you perform for the hour or whatever. If you think about it, I can be with my baby all day long. Today the commitment was we’re sitting here and the baby’s around, and I was like, “If she cries, bring me the baby and I’ll breastfeed her and she’ll be fine.” She’s cool. For the shows, I can have my baby on me, but I know that I’m gonna play for an hour, an hour and a half tops. The baby’s going to be fed right before I go on stage and she’s going to be nice, asleep or whatever. So it is possible. To me there’s no really... Like a mystery, you know? I was raised by a single mother too, so it just comes. Bus drivers have children. How do they do it? I feel like a bus driver has a way harder time to manage childcare than me, that I can bring my kid with me, you know? Audience member Thank you. Audience member Hello. I just had a question about your experience with collaboration because this group of people in this event is very collaboration-forward and as someone without very much experience collaborating with people from different genres and skill sets and whatnot, I was wondering if you had any insights or things that surprised you about what was similar between you and someone else or what was a hardship you had and how you kind of navigate the space of collaborating with people from such a diverse sample group of genres. Lido Pimienta First of all, your hair is fabulous. Audience member Thank you. Lido Pimienta Second of all, collaboration is a core element in the Lido Pimienta landscape. Because I am a singer and because I am a great singer, everybody wants to work with me, and that’s actually how I started. I started singing and writing these songs for producers and for bands. My catalog, collaborating, the songs in this catalog of collaborations are bigger than my own catalog of songs that I officially released, and that was a great practice because we shouldn’t fall into Enya territory. You know who Enya is? So, Enya [sings “Sail Away”] she’s great but she also lives in a castle isolated from the world and she only listens to her own music, right? Yeah, facts. Very proudly, she’s like, “I don’t listen to no Beyoncé. I listen to myself,” you know? So, I feel like that’s why the album sounds like... Everything she makes is so odd and disconnected and that’s why I like it, but we should really use our strengths... Like collaboration is the opportunity to use your strengths and experiment and putting work forth that you wouldn’t necessarily do on your own, right? So, songs with A Tribe Called Red for example, “The Light.” I wouldn’t really put something out like that by myself and they took that song and they turned it into three songs and it’s been really great to see how far that song goes. It’s also great when the songs are good, you know? In my experience I’ve recorded on horrible music just because I need to put myself out there, and when I hear those songs, I just cringe. It’s just horrible, because I was doing it because I just have to... You know, you feel this pressure that you have to put yourself out there. You know what? It’s better if you only put excellent work out there that you are proud of, than a lot of songs that are out there just because you had the opportunity to do them. So I think that’s the most valuable advice that I can give you, is only put it out if you really believe in it and set the boundaries before you set any music down, because I also made the mistake of, “Here’s a song,” and then I hear it back and they... I mean, we’re just not in sync. Whatever they’re listening to for me sounds out of sync. You know, like so many remixes that people are like, “And this is going to be in an HBO series,” and I’m like, “Oh really? It sounds horrible. Where is the one? Where is the two? Where is the three? What is happening?” Because I didn’t put those boundaries and I didn’t get the rules, the game rules before the stuff went into mixing and mastering. So, yeah, have those honest conversations. Be very respectful, of course. There’s no need into fighting with people but always be very stern. Your experience might be different than mine. I am a woman, I am brown and I sing like a little girl and I have this high-pitched voice and people think that I’m adorable. It happens all the time. I do look adorable. It’s like this fight that I have but I do choose to look like this. I do present myself in this type of way, but it’s still like I should be respected because of my qualifications and my experience, but a lot of people would just... Like the last thing that happened is this producer in LA, I did a session with this Mexican artist. We did our song. Everything was good and I also gave her this extra stuff for her to use in the future because I trusted her. The engineer took it upon himself to present the songs for this big contract thing, whatever, and I didn’t like it. I didn’t even like what he did, and I told him straight up, I was like, “Who gave you permission?” Because he emailed me, not even to tell me, “I am going to put this song in this whatever, to whatever.” He said, “Can you please send me the translation of these words?” And I was like, “Who the f--- are you?” And he was like, “Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, hysterical woman. Why are you... This is good for you.” It’s just like, “No, it’s not good for me because I am not reading this contract. Whatever the f--- you are reading, whatever opportunity got your way, you’re using my voice without my consent,” so that’s not collaboration, but back when I started 10 years ago, I did that so many times and I didn’t know that it was wrong. So yeah, set your boundaries and only work on stuff that you really, truly believe in because it’s gonna come to haunt you and it’s horrible. That feeling of being a participant in something that is mediocre is a terrible feeling, so avoid that. Be diplomatic and be respectful and just bring your best game. Don’t hold back. Don’t hold back. That’s another thing, when we collaborate, “I really shouldn’t give them that. That bassline is really, really too sick. I should just use it myself.” It’s like no, you will continue to write amazing basslines. Put your best work forward. It will pay off. Don’t hold back, because we’re also procrastinators, and then that sick bassline is gonna be hidden and no one’s gonna hear it in the next 10 years, so just put it out. Put your music out because this is the practice. We’re in this practice and we really need to be committed to it and the more music that you write, the better musician that you’re gonna be. The more stuff that you put out, the better artist that you’re going to end up becoming. Audience member Hey Lido, what’s up? You mentioned earlier about only waving the flag of Lido Pimienta and not necessarily representing Flags, capital F. So, in an industry and in a paradigm, especially in the Canadian context where there’s always a hyphen of, “Indigenous-Afro-Latina artist wins Polaris blah blah blah,” you get exactly what I mean. How do you navigate the pigeonhole in the awards shows, in the CVC interviews, in this interview. I’m sure it wasn’t just Lido Pimienta. I’m sure it was Polaris prize Afro-Latina. How do you navigate that pigeonhole if you will? Lido Pimienta I just pick my battles. Sometimes it’s worth it to address it. Sometimes it’s not worth it to address it, and I’ve learned that the hard way. After the prize, after the Halifax Pop Explosion debacle, after all of that stuff. Now the online harassment and the bullying and the stuff that I experience on the daily, I feel like I have toned it down so much in the things that I say, the way that I express myself. I am very selective into the things that I decide to just tell it like it is, because sometimes there’s no point. Sometimes there’s no point. The monster is too big and I still have to protect myself. I still have to protect my children, and sometime... Now it’s becoming where I get a little bit of more of a say in how I want to be introduced, so people will send me, “This is the bio, is this description good? How do you want us to introduce yourself?” I’m like, “Artist.” At the same time, I also know that it’s not going to be like this forever and I mean in the future, it’s not going to be like this forever where we’re just going to be artists that happen to be born in a different country or happen to speak a different language. It’s going to come and I understand because history and herstory has taught me that someone has to start it and the rest of us will follow. So I know that I’m someone in history and herstory that is setting this precedent and maybe it’s gonna change. I also, I’m very proud of being Afro-Colombian. I’m very proud of being indigenous, so when you put it out there, it’s like, “Yes motherf---er, the black indigenous has arrived.” Sometimes it is important to let them know. Say it to the people in the back. So it just depends on also who’s saying it, because some people need to hear it, you know? Indigenous people need to see other indigenous people killing it and doing good things… Or actually no like Gandhi taught me, “Don’t say killing it, say fertilize it.” People that are fertilizing it, own it and be glad, so it’s also good. It really is about what you... The context, really, because some people will say it because they want to start some sh-t and you have to be prepared. You have to be prepared because there’s a lot of fake journalists out there that will use you as click bait and it just comes with the territory. Again, if you have a good crew, you won’t be Britney in 2007. Have a good crew, right? Because when you need to cry, someone will take your tears and they’re going to be there for you, and they’re like, “Yes, girl. Here is some ice cream. Let’s watch Project Runway. It’s going to be okay.” You need your crew to help you with that because sometimes... Most times it’s got to be awkward. Most times it’s horrible. Most times is not pleasant. That’s happening right now, this isn’t it all the time. Most times, it’s, I go to a show. My name is big, written outside and they still just acknowledge my baby daddy number two, you know? Or my other bandmate. It always happens. I had this guy telling me... He couldn’t figure out my setup and he was like, “I know what we can do. You can use my microphone that is really good for female voices,” and that was a moment where I had to decide, “Do I want to fight this guy? No,” and I didn’t because I knew if I called him out, the sound for the show was going to be a piece of sh-t. So I was just like, “I have a little cold right now. I don’t want to get anyone else sick. I’m going to stick to my microphone. Thank you.” But when the show was done, he heard it, right? So it’s just like that. Just own it. Just own it. I am indigenous. I am black. I am Colombian. I am a mother. I am a Polaris prize-winning artist. I am a badass bitch.

Title: Larry Heard (2018)

Larry Heard (2018)
Larry Heard should be in no need of an introduction. As a producer, he’s been responsible for some of the most enduring house music anthems, including “Mystery Of Love,” “Bring Down The Walls” and, of course, “Can You Feel It.” Growing up in Chicago in the ’70s and ’80s, Heard witnessed the birth and death of disco while drumming in a broad range of bands. Swapping drums for drum machines as an outlet for his myriad musical ideas, Heard dove into the burgeoning house scene and quickly became one of its most exciting young producers, counting legendary DJs like Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy as early supporters. Over 30 years later, his work has refused to diminish in importance while fans old and new remained captivated by his live shows.
In this public conversation as part of the Red Bull Music Festival Moscow 2018, Heard sat down with journalist Chal Ravens to discuss his musical education in Chicago, meeting a kindred spirit in Robert Owens and the stories behind some of his many aliases. Oh, and being sampled by Kanye West.
Hosted by Chal Ravens Hi. Welcome to this very exciting Red Bull lecture, with a very important musical figure. I’m honored to be sat next to one of the most influential musical figures of the last 30 years. He’s responsible for some of the most enduring Chicago house tracks ever made and also for some of the most unique and soulful electronic albums of the ’80s, the ’90s, the noughties, the tens. This year he released his first album in 13 years, Cerebral Hemispheres, and it seems to me that he is just as in tune with his self-made musical universe as he has ever been. Please welcome Larry Heard. [applause] Larry Heard Thank you all. Thank you for being here. Chal Ravens So you have a long career, so there’s quite a lot for us to get through, potentially. Larry Heard OK. We’ll see how much I remember. Chal Ravens You’re often described as a deep house artist, and your music is often described as timeless. I agree with that one, the latter. So what I thought what we could do this evening is maybe look at some of the different aspects to your sound, because there are more facets than initially meet the ear, perhaps. So, I wanted to start with a track, that’s actually quite a new track. I thought I’d start with “Qwazars,” which came out a couple of years ago, and it was the return to your Mr. Fingers alias. Larry Heard Yeah. Yeah. I completely forgot about using the name. I stopped using it for a while, after the MCA deal, just to make sure everything was legally clear. But you get involved in different things, and you’re just moving forward, and you’re not even really thinking. Chal Ravens So it wasn’t meant to be like a big, dramatic return, or... Larry Heard No, it was just kind of oversight. And then I was involved in doing a lot of the traveling, doing DJ jobs and remixes and things like that. So I had shifted away from my own productions for a while, and all the time was devoted elsewhere. So, all those things combined, kind of led to the situation. Chal Ravens OK. Let’s here “Qwazars” and then we’ll talk a bit about some other things. (music: Mr. Fingers – “Qwazars”)
Larry Heard [applause] Thank you. Chal Ravens I hate to fade it down, but if we listen to all of your tracks in full, then we will be here for a long time. [laughs] I just wanted to start with that particular track, ‘cause I think it encapsulates quite a lot of aspects, of your sound, maybe? Larry Heard OK. Chal Ravens It also happens to be one of my favorite ones, which is not usually something you can say about an artist, that they’ve made one of your favorite tracks 30 years after they released their first track. Larry Heard Thank you. Chal Ravens Bringing it back to this idea of deep house, or whatever it may be. Can you explain or describe, the kind of mood that it is that you’re looking for when you make a track? Larry Heard I definitely come from the world of improvisation. We grew up with a piano in the house, so we were improvising as little kids, playing theme songs from TV shows and things like that, and that just continues today. I don’t really go in thinking anything. It’s more meditative than there’s thinking involved. It’s more paying attention to the sounds, and how they interact with each other. So I let the sounds that I come across... And for this one in particular, “Qwazars,” it was a cool little patch I was using, I think Reason 4 for that, and it was a cool arpeggiating bass sound that I used as my foundation, and then I built on top of it, but not a whole bunch of stuff. Just kind of sparsely there, give the track some room to breath. But most of the time I just freestyle when I go into the studio and save everything, and then when it’s time to do a project or something, then you review everything and see which things seem like they would fit into it. Chal Ravens So that idea of room to breath, do you find that to complete a track, you’re often taking things away rather than adding? Larry Heard Sometimes. It depends on how far you go out of control. I had my mad scientist side, where I’d try to do a whole lot of things, or experiment with different effects and things like that, and then you have to pull back the reins and corral it in and tame it a little bit. Chal Ravens Well you’re quite famously a laid-back guy, supposedly. But I wondered if that’s a personality trait that you put into your music, or if you look to music to help you be that laid-back? Larry Heard I think it’s more a personality that goes into the music, because I literally came up with people thinking I was a deaf-mute in the neighborhood, because I never said a whole lot. Chal Ravens That you were deaf-mute? Larry Heard No, they thought I was, ‘cause I heard someone, one of my brother’s friends, ask him was I deaf, because they never heard me say anything. I guess I just didn’t have anything specifically to say. Chal Ravens What were you doing instead? You were thinking instead. Larry Heard Probably. And observing things around me. Yeah, I always knew I was one of those people who observe everything, and look around. Just like we were just looking around the room, ‘cause I saw the stage from this side earlier, and I hadn’t seen it. So now I get a chance to look at it from this angle. Chal Ravens Natural observer. Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens So, let’s go back to the beginning a bit. Growing up in Chicago, in ’70s, you weren’t really listening to dance music, that’s right? Larry Heard When dance music came around, remember we had disco and there was an early wave of electro music from Europe. They came over to the States, so we had that, as far as dance music. And then we had the soul music that everyone danced to, and the rock songs that everyone danced to. So I guess there always has been dance music, ‘cause if you go back in history, people always danced. So whatever they danced to is the dance music. It’s just kind of our newer interpretation of music, kind of sculptured sometimes for DJs. Where a lot of maybe like, Philadelphia International stuff, it wasn’t set up with 32 bars, or 64 bars, to set up for a DJ. Sometimes it came right in, as a surprise. Chal Ravens But maybe compared to some of the people of your generation, who became DJs and so on, you were kind of into rock music and stuff? Larry Heard Yeah. I was playing. I started off on guitar, and shifted to bass, and then shifted to drums, and felt more comfortable there, and the music that was most challenging was the prog rock stuff that I was coming across. Yes and The Who and Genesis and Rush, and things like that. So, that’s where I started doing my practicing. Chal Ravens So you were teaching yourself drums by playing to Genesis... Larry Heard Yeah, ‘cause I tried structured environments a couple times, with drums, and with guitar, and with piano, and it just didn’t work for me. It wasn’t the right fit. So I was better at just buying the records, and then listening to what they were doing, or try to decipher it, and then do it myself. Kind of learn that way. Chal Ravens And so, were you playing in bands at the same time? Larry Heard Yeah. Either it was a working band, or a jam band, where we just all practiced and exercised our instruments at the same time. Chal Ravens So not writing original music, necessarily? Larry Heard I did get around to an R&B band that I was with, where we started doing some original songs. Yeah. Chal Ravens And you came from a family who were interested in music? Larry Heard Oh, yeah, they all played. As you go back on the timeline, before television came around, a lot of them had a piano in the house, they didn’t have a television. So that was the entertainment center, where someone who played would play, and everyone else would sing and things like that. It was kind of family interactive. Chal Ravens Gathering around the piano. Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens Did you always harbor the intention of being a musician professionally? Larry Heard No I didn’t. I was thinking about either being a teacher, a lawyer, or an architect, and I was kind of being pushed towards architect ‘cause one of my uncles has a firm in Chicago. I just ended up stumbling across music, when someone in the neighborhood was putting a band together, and he said they were looking for a drummer. I just bluffed and said I played, and then I immediately got a drum set and started hiding so I could practice, to at least make good on my bluff. That’s how I kind of got into it, just spur of the moment. Chal Ravens Obviously you’re considered one of the founding fathers of Chicago house, but is it right also that you weren’t necessarily going to the clubs early on? That kind of came later? Larry Heard No, not really. I was more involved in the live music scene in the earlier years, and then as I started to put some distance in between myself and some of the bands... The last band I was in, I guess it wasn’t really customary for the drummer to have musical ideas. So that kept me a little confined for a minute, but I ended up having to buy my own synthesizer, and then buy a drum machine to keep the time, since I wasn’t gonna be able to hold the sticks and do the keyboard part. So it was more just practicality than me being a techno geek or anything like that. Chal Ravens So the synth came and the drum machine came because you couldn’t play it all yourself? Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens So you had to have the machines to do it? Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens OK, makes sense. Larry Heard Practical use. Chal Ravens Thinking of Chicago in the ’70s, this is the era of “disco sucks,” and famously the Disco Demolition Night happened in Chicago. Do you remember that? Larry Heard I remember seeing it on the news, but even at that time, I think that might have been ’79, I was in some rock group jamming, or something like that, so it was just a story I saw on the news. Chal Ravens I was gonna say, which side? Larry Heard Well, I didn’t have any problem with disco. I like all kinds of music. Classical, country, rock, reggae, it doesn’t matter what it is, as long as it sounds good. That’s the disclaimer. I saw it on the news and I thought, “How crazy is this?” is what went through my head, and then I’m sure some of those people had to go right back out and buy some of those other records because they were just doing it because of peer pressure and social pressure. Chal Ravens The Disco Demolition Night was famously organized by a local radio host, and happened at the White Sox stadium? Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens And a load of people who loved rock and hated disco brought their disco records along and they got, I think, blown up in the middle of the pitch, or destroyed. Larry Heard I wonder, how do you hate disco, but you have the records? Chal Ravens It’s a good point. [laughs] Larry Heard Yeah. So they obviously liked it at some point, but got turned away. I think it was more economics too. The disco music was starting to come in economically where The Rolling Stones had to do a disco song, and Rod Stewart, and everybody else just kinda catching up with what the independents and the people on the street already knew about five years before. Chal Ravens Right, because disco was already maybe a bit tired, by 1979. People were perhaps a bit fed up of it, but I think it also reflects that Chicago is a very segregated city as well. There’s obviously a strong racial element to that. Larry Heard Yeah. I can’t say I know a ton about it, ‘cause I always was on an alternate path or something, because I was, again, playing with rock groups. It was two black guys, two Latino guys, playing Rush songs. Chal Ravens That’s quite an unusual... Larry Heard Well, you get a mixture of people that you interact with when you’re just involved in artistic things, period. Where they don’t go by the social standards. Chal Ravens Given that the demolition night was hosted by a radio host, Steve Dahl, radio itself was huge in the development of dance music, and particularly in Chicago, right? Larry Heard I think everywhere. It just reaches more sets of ears. Chal Ravens And were you listening to that kind of thing? Were you listening to the Hot Mix 5? Larry Heard Oh yeah, I knew about Donna Summer, “Ring My Bell,” and “Night Fever.” Knew about all that stuff, ‘cause it was just like knowing about Nicki Minaj right now. You don’t have to actually be listening to the radio, but it’s always around you so you end up hearing it. Chal Ravens So you’re hearing it on the radio but not necessarily going to the clubs to experience what the DJs were doing with it? Larry Heard No, not at that time. I was working full-time first of all. I started working when I was about 15, so a lot of things that other kids did, sneaking into clubs, you hear a lot of those. I was already at work, so I didn’t have the liberty to do that, you know. Trying to help my family out. Chal Ravens What kind of jobs were you doing when you were a teenager? Larry Heard Oh, I did the McDonalds thing. I did a donut shop for a long time. Chal Ravens Donuts? Larry Heard Yeah, you get to hate donuts after a while, you know. Then once I was in my last year of high school I was able to take a civil service test, and moved into government work. Chal Ravens So you had a proper job? Larry Heard Yeah, with benefits, and all those fun things you don’t get with music. Chal Ravens So I was wondering what got you interested in electronic music, specifically? You said, of course, it helped you to replace your band, but I guess at that time, there must have been more European stuff coming over, like Kraftwerk. Larry Heard Yeah. Of course we went through the disco years, and then the next period, starting at about the ’80s, a lot of the New York... I don’t even know what to call the sound, but New York had its own kind of flavor, New York, New Jersey. And then we had the stuff that was coming in from England, and from the Netherlands, and Germany, and different places like that. So all that stuff was just really captivating, it was different from what we were hearing every day, and I think that’s what everybody seeks. Even now, you want something different, not the same thing over and over. Chal Ravens And maybe I just think this as an outsider, and having read the stories, but it seem like the European stuff, particularly in the Midwest, had this big impact, like Kraftwerk in Detroit, and it seemed to really catch on in the clubs and everything. People were really playing the synth stuff, right? Larry Heard Well, I wasn’t really in the clubs, but I knew I heard it on the radio, which is even reaching more people, ‘cause the whole population can’t fit into a club, but most of them do have radios, so you just reach a bigger audience. Chal Ravens What was the first piece of synth or drum machine, or electronic stuff that you bought? Larry Heard I bought a Roland Jupiter-6 synthesizer. Chal Ravens Why did you choose that one? Larry Heard Well, of course as musicians, you always go to the music store, and you sit there dreamily looking at everything, and wishing and hoping. So we did that. Even with DJ stuff, when hip-hop came around, we started discovering more than one turntable and the mixer, that kind of thing. You just window shopped. So that’s what we did, and I of course tapped on the synthesizers, ‘cause you want to hear the sounds, because just to look at it is only half the experience. They look exciting with all the knobs and buttons, but then it’s completed when you start to hear the sounds, and go through the patches. Chal Ravens Did you try all of them out in the shop, until you found one that you liked? Larry Heard Well, not every one, but I tried out enough where I knew, yeah, I can work with this. Yeah. Chal Ravens So, what happened when you took the Roland Jupiter-6 home? Larry Heard Well, that first night I made “Mystery of Love,” and I made “Washing Machine,” that first night. So it was just my first drafts ever. I was lucky enough to catch it on a cassette tape, which has been lost since then, of course. Chal Ravens Really? So two of your most famous tracks you made the day that you bought your first synth? Larry Heard Yes, I guess it was just... You have creativity inside yourself that wants to burst out, and it’s being stifled, because of, again, a tradition. Like again, I always had ideas when I was behind the drums, but the other band members weren’t really receptive, again, to the drummer having ideas, and I think there’s pretty much a rich history of drummers, like Phil Collins, and Narada Michael Waldon, and people like that, that step out. But you have to express your ideas, or it’s not fulfilling. Chal Ravens Phil Collins makes sense as a musical hero for you as well, being in Genesis. Larry Heard Yeah. I liked him as a drummer, I liked him as a producer as well. Chal Ravens Can you explain exactly how you recorded that, in those days, because you were just using basic stuff? Larry Heard Well, I had two cassette decks, so that’s what happened. I ran one pass on one cassette, and then, once I decided what I wanted over the top, I ran the next pass, and just played the parts live. It was kind of a semi-live, semi-sequenced, kind of a thing. Chal Ravens So, you basically just made it and it was complete then? Larry Heard Yeah. Just two passes. Again, keeping it simple. I was really just a beginner, as far as trying to do any composition or anything like that, so I couldn’t really do like a 80-piece orchestra thing. I could just do something simple enough for me. Chal Ravens And how did you get to actually release that record? How do you go from just making it in your room to suddenly somebody’s actually playing it in a club? Larry Heard We were lucky enough to have a vehicle in Chicago, which were the club DJs, who were playing off of cassette decks with pitch controls, or reel-to-reels with pitch controls, and things like that, and they were willing to listen to what you had, and give it a chance. Of course, we went the route that is traditionally sought after, where you make a tape, and you send it to Universal, or you send it to somebody, and you never hear back. Chal Ravens Did you do that? You tried that? Larry Heard Yeah. That’s tradition too, to do that, to find out it doesn’t work 99.9% of the time. So a good buddy of mine made the suggestion of, “Why don’t you just put it out yourself?” Which turned a light bulb on top of both our heads, and said, “Yeah, let’s do some research, and see how this is done.” And even the first two releases didn’t have a label name or anything, ‘cause I didn’t know how you go about establishing a name, and that kind of a thing. But I did start my publishing off, so I ended up deciding to use the publishing name as the label name since I got a clearance for the name. And again, since we had the forum of the clubs in town, and some of the guys that were playing at clubs were also on the radio, some of the Hot Mix 5 guys, so that was an additional boost, where more people, maybe who like club music, but maybe you have kids, you’re married, you’re on a different shift, or something like that and you can’t go. So it gives them the opportunity to hear the music as well. Chal Ravens Right, because DJs were using cassettes then too. Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens Do you remember... Larry Heard I think that was one of the new technologies at that time, a cassette. Chal Ravens [laughs] Do you remember hearing your track on the radio? Larry Heard I remember driving on Lakeshore Drive, and “Mystery of Love” came on. It was snowing, and it’s just one of those things where you almost run off the road. You’re just so excited and surprised, and no one’s in the car with you, to say anything to, and this is before cell phones, so we couldn’t call anybody, or text anyone. Chal Ravens You couldn’t put yourself on Facebook Live. Larry Heard So you had to just get home, and, “Did anybody hear the song?!” Chal Ravens But then you actually re-recorded it though, right? To put it out on a bigger label later? Larry Heard Yeah, and that was an early lesson of me learning that recreating the moment is not always successful, ‘cause we had tried it numerous times. Even some of the early drafts I did with Robert [Owens], where it had a great feel in my little bedroom, but then when we translated it to the studio it just kind of lost its edge. I think you lost both of us in a way too, where our feelings about it weren’t the same as when we just did it, and it was off the cuff, it was not rehearsed or anything, it just came out honestly. Next time it feels like you’re just replicating something that you can’t replicate, ‘cause it was just that moment. I used a patch on the synthesizer, but I altered it and I didn’t save it, so that means it was immediately gone the first time I turned it off. Chal Ravens Normally people learn that, because they’re trying to make their kit work for the first time, but you’d accidentally recorded a hit the first time you used it, so no wonder you couldn’t remember what you did. Larry Heard [laughs] I just wish I could have saved the bassline to maybe use in other selections, or just for other people to look at the settings, who have been trying to decipher the sound. Chal Ravens And at this point, you meet a man called Robert Owens. How did you meet Robert in the first place? Larry Heard Robert was DJing. Actually, a friend of mine that lived around the corner, was more in tune with the DJs at the quote-unquote underground clubs at the time. So he took the cassette and delivered it to Frankie Knuckles, or Ron Hardy, and different people he knew. And one of those people was Robert Owens, and he was playing it, and I happened to be at the party. I just stepped over... Chal Ravens You did go to some parties? Larry Heard Yeah. Once I left my bands, maybe about ’84, I start seeing some clubs, which is late for some people who’ve been in there since the ’70s, but then once I really stumbled across these clubs, I was interested in, what other music are you playing that I never heard, ‘cause somethings are deemed inappropriate for radio, of course. Chal Ravens Right. Larry Heard So I wanted to hear, where’s that music that’s been held back from us. Chal Ravens Did you enjoy the stuff that you found at the clubs, that was new to you? Larry Heard Oh yeah, it sent you on a shopping mission all the time, and that’s what I liked, because I bought a lot of records anyway. So just having more stuff on your list, gives you a nice size stack to carry home and listen to. Chal Ravens So Robert was DJing? Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens So how did you know that he was going to be a singer for you? Larry Heard I didn’t know. He started talking, and he told me that he writes lyrics, and he sang. I said, “Well, we should get together.” So, all of this was pretty normal, as far as how people meet. No spectacular story, just a normal life story of we meeting because of common interest, and then each discovering what the other does, and interested in participating in it. Chal Ravens I’m kind of interested in what happens when two musicians first get together, because it’s like a blind date almost. How do you start making music with someone you’ve never thought of making music with before? Larry Heard I don’t know, but it happened for us. So again, it was organic. Again, all this stuff, all the questions center around thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, analyzing and trying to predict things. It just all happened organically. The whole situation in Chicago with DJs being willing to play the music and then the community at large being captivated, ‘cause now it’s people in the community. We love Earth Wind & Fire, we love the Ohio Players, but they seemed like it’s far away. When you discover it’s someone you went to high school with, someone who lives around the corner, that brings it a lot more into focus where you feel like, “Oh, well maybe if they’re doing something, maybe I can do it as well.” If it’s coming that close to you, you feel hopeful. Chal Ravens And so when you actually started recording with Robert, what was it about his style or his voice that you felt fit with what you were doing? Larry Heard Well actually, to be honest, I hadn’t heard him sing until we got together that first time. ‘Cause he was working when I met him, he was DJing. He couldn’t just stop DJing and start singing for me. It just ended up working out. Maybe if anyone in this room happened to be that person, maybe it would’ve worked out as well, if you’re on the same wavelength as far as having creative ideas. The same thing with him where his ideas were stifled. People telling him he couldn’t sing and would never amount to anything. That captivated me even more, the underdog person that people are predicting nothing’s gonna happen. Oh, that’s really satisfying to be a part of making something happen. Make the person eat crow in a way. [laughs] Chal Ravens So at this point you begin a pretty peerless run of classic tracks. Pretty much everything you put out in this period is classic. Larry Heard Thank you. Chal Ravens “Washing Machine,” “Can You Feel It,” “Amnesia” and so on. I’m interested if you then started becoming a club regular, and how much being in the clubs shaped what you were actually making. Was there a feedback loop there? Larry Heard I didn’t become a club regular because I was working full-time and a lot of the time doing overtime as well. My time was pretty much... Chal Ravens Were you working nights? Larry Heard I started off working nights at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in their computer room. So my availability was limited. But we made it work. It seemed like it was effortless, us getting together, ‘cause I was always making tracks in my free time, and he was obviously writing lyrics ‘cause he had lyrics on paper towels and napkins, he just had a big bag. So I would just play a track and he would pour things out of the bag and just grab something and just start ad-libbing. Which, again, was intriguing to me. OK, someone who knows how to ad lib, they’re not afraid to do it and not afraid to get laughed at if it’s comical. But most of the time he just has his way with his voice. It’s the sincerity and the passion that you literally feel as it’s coming out of his vocal chords. He pretty much sells you on his idea ‘cause he’s so passionate when he starts to sing it. Chal Ravens In that case, let’s play a Fingers Inc. track called “Bring Down The Walls,” which, as far as I’m aware, he wrote the lyrics on some toilet paper while... Larry Heard Uh huh. It was one take. Chal Ravens ‘Cause he worked... Larry Heard The different versions, each were one take. Chal Ravens Wow. And he worked in a hospital, I think, right? Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens So let’s hear “Bring Down The Walls.” Larry Heard And the doorbell rings on the dub version. (music: Fingers, Inc. – “Bring Down The Walls”)
Chal Ravens I realized when I was researching this that you actually remade this track recently for a compilation. It’s a kind of slightly glossy version for a charity compilation. Larry Heard Well, I haven’t seen the compilation so I don’t know exactly what you’re talking about, but we did something for New York. Is that... Chal Ravens A prison charity based in New York. Larry Heard It was more me re-editing and maybe rearranging in the end. Chal Ravens Polishing, maybe. Larry Heard Or the polish should have been done when we first did it, maybe doing it now, and incorporating a second vocalist. Chal Ravens The fact that you remade it for... It’s a charity that’s campaigning against America’s prison system, essentially, and better rights for people who are incarcerated. And it made me think a bit about how, some of the lyrics that Robert wrote do definitely have a political thrust to them even though they’re in a... Larry Heard They’re political and social. He taps on a lot of different things. Chal Ravens How did the political side actually play out at the time? Was there a sense of building a community, bringing down walls and that kind of thing? Larry Heard Maybe in a way ‘cause that actually happened with disco. Some people didn’t like the wall being broke down. They wanted the wall to stay up where everyone stayed compartmentalized and, “you stay here, you stay here, you listen to this, you listen to this,” and all the socially acceptable things. So this is one of the musics that went against the status quo, like punk rock and things like that. It went totally against it. And then we already had our own cultural movement in Chicago. It became known as the underground scene there to people who were interested in this different music that we weren’t hearing on the radio. Chal Ravens I’m interested in whether it felt like that at the time, as if it was an actively political scene? Larry Heard I don’t know if you consciously think about it ‘cause you’re just getting such a big kick out of... For myself and Robert where we had been stifled as far as our creativity, now someone’s listening to something that’s 100% your idea. Some of the people I was in bands with were coming to me saying, “Can you produce something for me?” I was like, “How did this happen? You didn’t want me to touch a keyboard back then.” But you’re just excited that someone is interested in your music and listening to it and dancing to it and buying it. Not just ‘cause there’s a whole lot of discussion a lot of times, but sometimes the people that have the most to say don’t really purchase anything, they just have a big opinion. Chal Ravens So tell me about Fingers, Inc. How did you get from working with Robert to forming Fingers, Inc.? Larry Heard I guess it started with Robert and my collaboration, but once we start working with Ron Wilson, who worked with me in government, I discovered he sang when I went to a performance of his. He was involved with dancing and teaching dance, but I didn’t know he sang. Chal Ravens So he was your government colleague, right? Larry Heard All I knew was the government stuff until I got invited to one of his performances. It just seemed like another person to bring in to broaden things a little bit. Chal Ravens Yeah because his voice works in balance with Robert’s. They perform two different functions, in a way. Larry Heard Robert’s more the wilder, unorthodox, unpredictable, and Ron Wilson is more... I think his father was in either The Flamingos or The Spaniels, one of those groups. He comes from people who had musical talent as well. It definitely showed in his voice. It was a juxtaposition between the two voices. Chal Ravens And in 1988, you put out a record called Another Side, which included a lot of tracks that had already come out, but expanded it into a full album. And Another Side, I think, is unarguably a classic house album, but I realized, researching this, that until it came out, I think digitally last year, it had never had a proper US release. Is that right? Larry Heard Yeah it never was released in the States. Chal Ravens So how does that happen? Larry Heard It happens, again, when people have a big opinion but they don’t actually purchase anything. You’re wasting your time servicing them ‘cause they’re not interested in patronizing what you’re doing. Chal Ravens I’m intrigued though, as to how house was seen in Chicago. Wasn’t it huge? Wouldn’t people in Chicago want this record? What was the... Larry Heard Well, Chicago is a huge city, so something can be huge and millions of people not know it exists. That’s what was happening with the house music scene. It was under the radar. ‘Cause we did, we had Earth, Wind & Fire, we had The Bar-Kays, we had Cameo, we had the Ohio Players. Those are the people that the general public knew. Parliament and guys like that, how can you not know that? Chal Ravens Did you notice that you were becoming successful abroad, or in other cities, where perhaps you hadn’t even been yet? Did you feel that there was something that people... Larry Heard I don’t know if I’d jump to the term “successful,” but you’re noticing a reception where people were interested in listening, where some people it was just a cold shoulder as something related to disco or related to dance music and club culture. Some people just shut you down right away, “I don’t want to hear anything about that.” Chal Ravens Like radio hosts or like... Larry Heard Yeah, radio definitely. If you think about it... Well, we can start on “Mystery Of Love.” “Mystery Of Love” showed up on the Billboard charts, on the dance charts, at number 20-something, and Janet Jackson, “What Have You Done For Me Lately” was right under it. I’m sure the people at A&M Records weren’t too happy to see that. Some guy who just recorded something in his bedroom, and we made this big financial investment, we advertised in the magazine. So they used that might to start slowly getting things off the chart and getting some of the shows shut down and everything else. It’s economics, it wasn’t really anything personal. Chal Ravens It seems as though the music industry at the time just didn’t really get how to... Larry Heard They didn’t. I don’t think they still do in the States. But it just seemed lucrative, so we wanna run. It seemed like the hope of money. But ‘cause a whole lot of people like Adeva, Ten City, the list goes on and on as far as people who got signed, but the labels didn’t know really what to do with them once they did sign them and who to play them for, who to present the music to. Chal Ravens I think this happened again didn’t it, was it perhaps your debut album on MCA, which ended up charting higher than Eric B. & Rakim who were on the same label, I believe? MCA ended up, again, not being quite sure what to do with Larry Heard I guess. Larry Heard Well, I don’t think they ever were sure, due to my manager working at the label at the time that secured the deal. But outside of that I probably would never have gotten the deal. And we got signed out of the UK offices as well. It wasn’t LA or New York. So people who were more receptive to the music. Chal Ravens The UK was definitely more receptive in the mainstream after acid house happened. At what point did somebody say that you should start DJing then? Did you want to do that? Larry Heard I think it had always been mentioned here and there, and I did it at home for fun and just your own therapeutic reasons. But I hadn’t really thought about it, I was so accustomed to playing some instrument or being involved in a band, and in the end transitioning into this producer capacity was a big job in itself, where you’re learning everything from start to finish. So I just couldn’t take everything on, I think I was still working as well. Once I got to the Another Side album that’s when I decided to leave my job so I could really focus before I start maybe getting older and maybe have kids, get married, things like that where you start to talk yourself out of things that you wanted to pursue. I didn’t want to do that. Chal Ravens So around this time you have the deal with MCA as a solo artist, and there’s a record in your catalog that I found which is a sampler, and it’s been labeled Quiet Storm Sampler. It’s got a few tracks, it’s got “What About This Love?” on it. It’s got “Closer,” and “On A Corner Called Jazz.” And I guess the label made it because they wanted to advertise you, to show radio stations, for instance, that there was this different side to your music. Larry Heard And then I think those were the stations that started playing... It was called quiet storm at that time. I don’t know, they probably have a new name now. Chal Ravens ‘Cause this is a concept. American radio has some... It’s quite alien to me as an English person, the way that it’s structured, but the idea of the format is really important. What is quiet storm? Can you explain... Larry Heard I didn’t coin that term. Chal Ravens No, no, no, no. Larry Heard It’s just more related to maybe things with jazzier tones and things like that, I think they lump into that category. Chal Ravens And there would be radio shows all over the US that were quiet storm and they maybe were more mature, perhaps? Larry Heard That next age bracket, maybe after college and all that kind of thing. Chal Ravens And maybe for people who aren’t in the clubs all the time, who are just driving around or doing whatever. So tell me a bit about what you wanted to do at that point ‘cause you were starting to make some music that was a bit different maybe, you were broadening out slightly. Larry Heard Yeah, That’s what you want to do as a producer and a composer, you want to grow. The album was exactly what I wanted to do ‘cause it was already started before MCA came into the picture, and I think some other labels came to the table but MCA won out. So I was where I wanted to be. I think the next album was a shift where MCA has an idea, remembered New Jack Swing and the shuffle beats and all that stuff, Sybil, “Don’t Make Me Over,” and all that stuff. They wanted to try that ‘cause it was more proven in the world that they do business in. I didn’t know if it was the right fit for me, but I agreed to it, and it just fell on its face. I know I’m not a big record company executive like some of those guys, but I thought veering away from the audience that was already interested, to an audience that doesn’t even know who in the world you are, I didn’t think that was the wisest decision. Chal Ravens So that was the only time when you allowed the record label to make a suggestion. Larry Heard They definitely went their own direction. Again, more going to something that they were more confident about. I guess they have more experience selling those records with Guy and those groups. Chal Ravens I’ve read this enough times that I assume it’s true, but you’re here so you can confirm. Is it true that Sade personally asked you to produce her album? Larry Heard She didn’t ask me personally, it just came through the chain of people that come across each other. I think Stuart Matthewman. Maybe more him that ran into someone that knew me and passed a cryptic message along. Chal Ravens But not like a label suggestion, but there was... Larry Heard No, I think the labels... I think something got suggested. I have friends who have worked at labels at different points in their careers and they suggested things, and it’s always met with the reaction of, “Doesn’t he do house music?” So they always categorize it as a lesser form of music. You’re not qualified to work with our real artists. That’s only play music that people do in their bedrooms. Who knows what else is said in private about the music. Chal Ravens So you definitely felt that house was undervalued and not seen as musical somehow. Larry Heard It was. You could pretty much sense it in some people that they detested it in a way. Chal Ravens But it’s an interesting album that never got made, ’Cause really at the time, the stuff that you were making wasn’t too dissimilar to what Sade was doing. It was definitely in the same vein. Larry Heard I thought the same thing too. I was thinking about vocalists like Gwen Guthrie, Phyllis Hyman, Anita Baker. That’s where my mind was going, my wishful thinking, but it was just off limits, I think, to want to be involved in that. Chal Ravens Let’s hear just a little bit of this particular track because I think, if you imagine Sade coming in halfway through, it makes perfect sense. So this is, “What About This Love.” (music: Mr Fingers – “What About This Love?”) Larry Heard [applause] Thank you. Chal Ravens Can I ask you to just explain to me what you said to me there about the vocal, which is you. Larry Heard Yes. Chal Ravens We haven’t heard you yet. Larry Heard It wasn’t supposed to be me, it was supposed to be David Hollister who was going to sing the song. He didn’t show up for the session so I just laid down a guide vocal, but then everyone started to really enjoy what I had done, so we ended up releasing it that way. And we had another scenario where this showed up on the Billboard charts with Lisa Stansfield right up under it, “All Around The World.” Again, another sticky situation. Chal Ravens [laughs] You’re quite good at accidentally doing a thing in the studio that’s the perfect thing. Larry Heard It’s probably more luck than anything. I didn’t deliberately know that would happen. Chal Ravens Tell me a bit about you as a singer though because that’s something that maybe is underplayed a bit, but you sing on a lot of your tracks overall. Larry Heard Yeah, I used to be more in the background in the bands I was in and different things like that, and working with Robert and Ron and Chris Coleman and some of these other folks. But when Robert moved to New York, I was in a sticky situation where it was like, OK, now what do I do? Ron Wilson’s voice wasn’t a good fit for some of the tracks I had, so I just tried to start doing some things myself after I got the reception I got with “What About This Love?” I just continued. Chal Ravens Do you like singing? Larry Heard It’s fun in the shower, [laughs] but it can be tricky when you’re doing it in a serious sense, hitting your notes right and all that fun stuff. You learn. Chal Ravens It’s interesting, as a comparison with... Let me see... Is it ’88 or so when you recorded it and then it maybe came out again later? Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens So at that time, again that’s Sade’s peak time and it’s a really interesting comparison, the level of poise and the way that you both hang back. They’re actually quite similar vocals... Larry Heard I’m definitely not a powerful singer like some of these people that belt out stuff. Like Robert can sing with a lot of power and Patti LaBelle, folks like that. Me, I don’t have that kind of power in my voice. Chal Ravens It seems to set the scene for what you go on to do, particularly in the next few albums with Sceneries Not Songs, this idea of perhaps creating more of a gentle mood. Is that something that you were trying to... Larry Heard Something I had more flexibility, as far as creativity to... Since it’s not a song, I don’t have to go by the song rule book, if that makes any sense, following any set patterns or the status quo. Chal Ravens So why choose then, “I don’t make songs, I make scenery?” Why does that even appeal to you? Larry Heard Well, this particular album is gonna be sceneries. I can make songs, but maybe not every time you wanna do that. You want something more freeform. That’s what Sceneries Not Songs... Even a project like Alien was more freeform. It was recorded in maybe seven or nine days. Pretty much I determined that each thing I record is gonna be on the album, so I was trying to do something really crazy to go along with the title that my manager suggested. Chal Ravens At this point, you stopped being Mr. Fingers. Larry Heard Yeah, that was after the MCA thing. This is ’92, ’93. Chal Ravens So for legal reasons... Larry Heard Well, just to make sure there’s no complications where they’re trying to forbid me from using it or anything like that. I went right to a name that I knew I could use and I don’t have to ask anyone’s permission. So another shortcut, like doing the label. You start to find ways around obstacles. Once you get over one, you get the confidence to try to face the next challenges. That’s what we did ‘cause we had no other choice. It was either face it and conquer it, or give up. Chal Ravens I wondered as well if there was a sense of using your real name as a milestone of, “Ah, this is the real me,” in some way? Larry Heard Not sure, but maybe subconsciously. I wasn’t really thinking of it from that perspective, but maybe you got a point. Chal Ravens So you’re releasing many different kinds of records in this period, because we’ve mentioned a few albums, but at the same time you’re still putting out more dance material on other different aliases. Larry Heard Gherkin Jerks, The Housefactors and The It, all those things. Chal Ravens And Robert had left, so you were working on your own a bit more. I mean you’d obviously acquired some newer gear here, ‘cause this sounds different. Larry Heard Yeah, my studio had been evolving since day one. Again, your confidence, you get something, people like it. Say, “Maybe it is work investing and getting something else to build the studio up.” Slowly, piece by piece. Chal Ravens And there’s a definite new digital sound in there, I think, or... Larry Heard This was at the studio, so I didn’t do it on two cassettes like I did a lot of things. Or even when I had a reel-to-reel, sometimes reel-to-reel to another reel-to-reel, just to do multiple takes. But then we discovered the studio through working with the Gherkin guys, and started working there and letting them handle some of the engineering chores instead of me trying to figure it out, kind of ad-libbing. Chal Ravens And were you usually an early adopter of new synths and stuff when they came out? Were you always eager to try the new stuff? Larry Heard No, just, right now, I’m still the last person... I don’t have an iPhone, [laughs] I don’t have a tablet and a watch and all that other stuff. I’m usually the one that... Just, again, observes and watches everyone else and hears their complaints and everything else, and say, ”Well, maybe I shouldn’t do that, then, if there’s so many complaints about this.” But I had to literally... I got laughed at by Frankie Knuckles because I was playing something by hand. We were playing “Distant Planet” in the studio, and he laughed at me ‘cause I wasn’t doing it with a sequencer. But I was doing it the way I knew how. And it was a few years later, I got in a production situation where I had to get a computer and start getting aware of the technology and building my skills up. Chal Ravens This is a good point to mention. You may not be able to see Larry’s shoes, but he just showed them to me. They’re 808 shoes. [applause] Larry Heard Yeah, Puma gave them to me. Chal Ravens They are the coolest shoes I have ever seen. Larry Heard I got the bass drum, so, yeah. Chal Ravens Oh, they’re different presets with different pairs. Larry Heard I don’t know, ‘cause I looked on the other shoe to see if it was different, but they’re both bass drum... Chal Ravens Gotta get the cowbell pair. Larry Heard Well, I need the whole set. I need the hi-hats and the cymbals and the toms. I need the works. Chal Ravens You need them to make the noise when you walk. Larry Heard Maybe the different colors, I don’t know. Chal Ravens Sorry, but you had to see that. I’m going to play... There’s a couple of tracks from this period that are all very different, and I’m just going to play a little segment of each because, again, as I was saying at the beginning, I think there’s so many different facets to Larry’s music that maybe don’t always get explored. Larry Heard Too bad we’re not at my house where you can start hearing the hip-hop tracks and the R&B things and some of everything, yeah. One day. Maybe they’ll see the light of day one day. Chal Ravens All unreleased material waiting. Larry Heard Yeah. Chal Ravens I would hope so. So I’m going to play a track from a record called Sceneries Not Songs, Volume One, and it’s called “Caribbean Coast.” All the tracks on this album, and the one after, I guess, have very evocative titles. They’re almost like settings. Larry Heard I think the titles, I always come up with those afterwards based on the feel of the music. I’ve never been to the Caribbean coast, but that’s what I imagine this kind of open, airy, kind of floaty thing to go along with the clouds and the horizon and the water and all that stuff, yeah. Chal Ravens So these are all kind of intuitive tracks that... You name them afterwards. Larry Heard Yeah. Pretty much all the tracks with these way-out names is just a product of, “What does this make me think in my mind?” Chal Ravens OK. Let’s just have a little bit of “Caribbean Coast.” (music: Larry Heard – “Caribbean Coast”) Larry Heard [applause] Thank you. I haven’t listened to that in a while. I heard sounds I didn’t remember. Chal Ravens What was that inspired by musically? Because to me, it’s got a kind of a new age-y thing, an ambient thing happening... Larry Heard And maybe a little dose of reggae in there, a little bit... And which where all things... I was always listening to Tangerine Dream and Brian Eno and crazy things like that. I’m trying to remember the lady’s name that did an album for Apple. I can’t remember her name, but it was very abstract and different. And I guess some of those off the wall, abstract albums put me in the mood to do it, yeah. Chal Ravens Yeah, Eno definitely came up in my mind, because it reminds me of his very distinct Music For..., Soundtracks For..., and creating moods that were geographical, that kind of thing. Larry Heard OK. Chal Ravens At this point were you traveling a lot, or did you tend to stay at home in the studio? Larry Heard I started doing some things, live things, with Robert and Ron. The first Fingers Inc. appearances were just Robert ‘cause I didn’t know if I wanted to do the live stuff, but once we formed what we were calling a group now, I was more obligated to do it. And then we started to get such a great reception in the UK and Scotland and Ireland and places like that, Wales, that we got invited to go on the Trax tour. We weren’t even with Trax anymore... Chal Ravens Who was on that? Larry Heard ... but we went on the tour. Chal Ravens Right. Who was on the tour? Larry Heard It was myself, it was Marshall Jefferson with On The House, Chip E., and Kevin Irving. Who else? Adonis. And I think Frankie Knuckles was supposed to be on it, but he already had other obligations where he wasn’t able to do it, so we got the honor of being the first house artists to come over, yeah. Chal Ravens And that was in Europe. Larry Heard Yeah. So, more UK and Scotland, yeah. Chal Ravens And what was the reception like in Europe compared to the US at the time? Larry Heard Well, it was like a madhouse in Nottingham and Birmingham, places like that. It was relatively quiet in London. So, yeah, you could pretty much count the people in the house there, ‘cause it really... London being a financial metropolis, I don’t think they were aspiring to be the first ones to break any music. So it was more the North where we got these receptions where it was like, “Who else is coming besides us?” They were there to hear us. Chal Ravens That’s interesting. Larry Heard Sort of surprising and encouraging. Chal Ravens There’s often, I think, a myth that some guys from outside London went to Ibiza and brought rave to the UK. But definitely in the North, there was always a very strong history of the Northern Soul, rare groove lineage, which I guess would have fit in. I want to play a completely different track which is from a few years before, and it’s called “MIDI Beats,” it’s under your Gherkin Jerks alias. Tell me what the point of the Gherkin Jerks stuff was, because it’s pretty different. Larry Heard It was just a mad scientist project where I was more experimenting with cabling and patch bays and generating weird pulses using the arpeggiators and things like that that were on the synthesizers at the time. So, science project. Chal Ravens Science project. But you put this out anonymously, right? Larry Heard Yeah, that and Disco D, ‘cause you don’t really know what they’re going to amount to, so it was more a crazy experiment that someone is willing to release for you. I say, “Well, if you’re willing to release it, yeah, let’s do it, but let’s leave my name off. Just in case.” Chal Ravens So you kind of waited to see what the reaction would be. Then you can say, “That was me.” Only if it’s popular. Larry Heard Or some people who really can pick up on your flavor. Some people immediately knew, others discovered as they went along. Chal Ravens Yes. Maybe some people guessed. Let’s hear a little bit of this, because it’s pretty wild. And I think it’s really obvious that, again, this is another corner of Larry’s style that’s ended up being influential in its own way. And particularly, if you’re into labels like The Trilogy Tapes or LA Club Resource or L.I.E.S., or all of those noisy guys, it makes sense. (music: Gherkin Jerks – “MIDI Beats”) Larry Heard [applause] Thank you. Chal Ravens It’s so minimal. Larry Heard Yeah. I think I was experimenting with the DJ tools concept, because again, you were more visiting clubs, seeing what they’re doing, taking note of different things. And me playing myself at home, I got plenty of records where they had either a capella or a drum beat or something like that where you’ve got to use it in your own fashion, however you want to apply it. So I wanted to participate in that. Chal Ravens Right. So actually, from seeing DJs and seeing what they could do, that helped you try new things that were useful. Larry Heard Yeah, help you navigate what to do that’ll work for them. Chal Ravens It’s interesting, ‘cause it seems as though you have this actually quite pragmatic approach to what to make, because you’re paying attention to what people want. Part of it is coming from your own ideas, but part of it is like, well, these people like a 4/4 beat, and the DJs would really be able to use this. Is that true? You’re kind of providing something that you know that people want? Larry Heard Well, I guess maybe you just recognize the need... “OK, this would fit in or be helpful.” Things like that. So it’s not me predicting what’s happening in the future or anything like that. It’s just more responding to something you see where there’s a lack of... I think we used to call them ‘minus one tracks,’ where either they had the vocal missing, where you’d use it like karaoke tracks, or to have the reverse, where a band would... It would be the rhythm track and you sing, or the reverse, the singing with no music for people to practice with, yeah. Chal Ravens Right, ‘cause it used to be the DJs, maybe like Walter Gibbons, and people who would have to make their own long edits of stuff so that they could DJ. But then, you’re like, well, I can give you that version for you. And then they don’t need... Larry Heard Yeah, and I think even after “disco sucks,” where the labels, the 12” format was already here, it’s like, what do we do with it now? So they maybe had some people who had some really interesting ideas. Well, let’s throw an a capella on, ‘cause where would be be without a capellas because people just enjoyed them so much. And again, the drum beats, the beat tracks. Chal Ravens I’m going to fast forward because we’re running out of time, but I just wanted to mention the fact that you’ve lived in Memphis for 20 years. Larry Heard 21 years now, yeah. Chal Ravens So tell me about a day in the life in Memphis. What’s a typical Larry day in Memphis? Larry Heard There is no typical day. You just navigate each one. You just navigate each one, and it’s challenges that show up. So I really never know what’s going to happen. I know what I’m going to try to do, but then a lot of times, that doesn’t really work out. You end up going with another flow. So I try to do my office stuff, ‘cause if people forget about that, that there’s actual paperwork that has to be done and kept track of. And I try to delegate a certain amount of time for studio. I try to stay on the eight to ten to 12 hour kind of a thing to be normal, because some people work around the clock, and I at least try to be normal and try to get out and get in the sun and go outdoors, as opposed to being cooped up all day and all night. Chal Ravens Do you prefer to be in a city that’s not a typical dance city? Larry Heard I don’t think dance has really anything to do with where you choose to live. It’s more the peace, and that’s why I work out from Memphis. It’s a smaller population, so that means less stuff buzzing around you all day and all night, all this activity. I live in a regular neighborhood where older couples go to sleep and it gets quiet, and that’s when you have time to hear your own thoughts. And sometimes that doesn’t really happen, depending on how busy it is where you live. Chal Ravens I think we may have time for some questions. Yeah. Does anybody have some questions? Wow. I think maybe we also have a microphone, yes. We’ll go down the front. Audience Member One, two. Yeah. I’m feeling myself like one of The Pointer Sisters because I’m so excited. And I was lucky enough to hear you in St. Pete[rsberg], it was awesome. Thank you. And the question is, in the late ’90s, many electronic musicians play music and records using samplers, and they work with samples a lot. But in your songs, I guess it’s only synthesizers, yeah? Did you try... Larry Heard I did plenty of practicing doing hip-hop tracks and things like that. Finding cool samples just like anyone else. Unfortunately, none of those have been released, so no opportunity to really know about that. But I do it just to have things in your skillset, just in case there is an opportunity, I’m somewhat prepared. Yeah. Audience Member Thank you. Chal Ravens I don’t believe that nobody would put out a hip-hop track that you made. You could just put it out. Do we want to hear a Larry Heard hip-hop track? Yes. Larry Heard Yeah, maybe I’ll get around to it at some point. Sneak some in, an album project or something. Chal Ravens But sampling is... You’ve famously been sampled by a famous hip-hop artist as well. Larry Heard Oh, yeah. Chal Ravens Kanye sampled you pretty... Did he ask you? Larry Heard Yeah, it’s kind of hard to keep that secret. So it took a minute, but they finally got all the business taken care of with that, yeah. Which was cool. Chal Ravens What did you think of that track? Larry Heard It was cool. There’s a rich heritage of... Sugar Hill Gang, that first big hit for a rap artist, that was a Chic backdrop. So there always has been this cross-pollination between dance and the hip-hop world. I remember Larry Levan used to play hip-hop, and he played dance, he played Latin. It was kind of all over the place. It wasn’t one... He took you on an adventure with music, yeah. Chal Ravens Another question. There’s one over there. Audience Member Hi. First, big thanks to you and Mr. White for your fantastic performance in St. Petersburg. Larry Heard Thank you, glad you enjoyed it. Audience Member That was just amazing. And my question is... So now, in Moscow and in Russia, there are many musicians. Many of them are talented. Some of them are more commercial DJs. But for upcoming, talented, enthusiasts, so what advice would you give to modern beginners? Larry Heard I’m not sure, ‘cause the way the dance community has evolved where... When we first started, maybe there was just a handful of people daring to make these tracks. But now it’s so widespread that it’s closer to the mainstream music world, where the number of people who are trying to do it is just so great. I don’t know what I would advise other than... Audience Member Would you advise to... Larry Heard ... Definitely doing something that expresses a uniqueness about yourself and your own personality, something that comes across different than every other track before it. It makes your ears stand up like, “Well, what’s this? This is definitely different.” I know that gets my attention, yeah. Audience Member Thanks. Chal Ravens This guy, yeah. Larry Heard Another one? OK. Audience Member Hello. Larry Heard Hi, how are you? Audience Member What would be your main advice to a musician in 2018? Larry Heard Everything I said to her. Just something that’s unique about your personality and what you do, how you approach it... That even if someone tries to duplicate it, they still have to follow behind you, because you’re the originator of it. So if you can do something unique... Audience Member Do you think it’s easier now to do that than it was back in your day? Larry Heard No. I would think it’s harder, again, just because of the sheer numbers of people who are doing it now. It’s literally tens of thousands of releases every day or every week. Chal Ravens There’s one over here. Microphone is coming. Audience Member Hello. So, thank you for your track “Can You Feel It.” Larry Heard Oh, thank you. Audience Member So, yeah, it makes me feel revolutionary to hear it. So I love it. Larry Heard Thank you. Audience Member Yeah, really, thank you so much. So can you tell the story of this track, because this is a stunning track. Larry Heard I can’t say there’s a specific story around the making of the track, because like I said earlier, I kind of ad-lib. So everything I do just out of improvisation. But I do recall, when I was listening back to it, I was looking out the window and snow was falling, and it looked like it was falling in slow motion, or I was just crazy or something. And a friend of mine named it. That was one of the few that I didn’t name myself. A buddy of mine was there and I said, “Well, what does this make you think of? What’s a good title?” And he came up with the title. Audience Member I feel it. Thank you. Larry Heard Thank you, thank you. Chal Ravens Do you have any specific things that you do in the studio to get yourself in the mood, in the zone? Larry Heard Well, I’m still trying to figure out specific things to do, because I’m never in the mood. Maybe I’ll call someone or just try to... I don’t know. Chal Ravens You have to force yourself. Larry Heard I have a problem with that. I end up calling someone else maybe that works on music, and I guess that helps me a little bit to get started and get motivated, yeah. Chal Ravens Do we have time for... two more, great. There’s one over there. I think there’s one here too. Whichever you like. One over here. Audience Member So, hi, Larry. Thanks a lot for coming. So the question is, I know now it is many kinds of house music today. So it’s bass house, progressive house, disco house. Which kind of house music do you yourself listen to, and what at least do you appreciate to listen, appreciate for people... Larry Heard Well, all the different sub-genres, I find that confusing, ‘cause I didn’t really come... Even in childhood, no one said, this is rock, this is soul, this is blues. Nobody set up those patterns. I just listened to Jim Croce and I just liked it. No one said it’s folk or that kind of thing. I listened to Santana, no one said it’s jazz rock. And nobody really made those distinctions. So I just heard the music that I liked the best out of all of those genres. And I got really, really confused when a whole lot of styles started coming out of the UK in the early ’90s. I was like, well, you feel like it’s a homework assignment to remember all these names. Trip-hop and this-hop and... It was too complex. I just wanted to get straight to the music, as opposed to getting involved in semantics and the genre titles. Audience Member Okay. I’ll simplify the question a bit. Do you have any favorite modern artists, if I can say so? Larry Heard Favorite modern artists... It gets tricky when you’re out yourself traveling and doing performances yourself to hear other people, ‘cause your time is occupied doing other tasks. But I’m sure if I get on iTunes or something like that, I’m going to come across something I like. Audience Member OK, thank you very much. Larry Heard Thank you. Chal Ravens Somewhere here. Oh, it was the same question. Do we have another one? I can’t tell which of these people... One of them... You. Audience Member Hello. I know it was many Chicago pioneers has disappointed about Trax Records. So my question is, do you have some difficulties with copyrights for your early tracks, and can we expect official represses on vinyl? Larry Heard I’m not sure, ‘cause I don’t have masters, ‘cause some of that stuff was done on cassette tapes. So there are not even existing masters to some things, depending on how far back on the timeline they go. So if we can find clean tapes and things like that, maybe so. And there’s actual demand for it as opposed to us just putting them out and they just sit in the store and collect dust. Audience Member Thank you. Chal Ravens Just finally... So we had to wait about 13 years for a new album. Is there going to be another? Larry Heard Well, that wasn’t deliberate. Chal Ravens Are we going to have to wait that long for another one? Larry Heard I hope not. I’m trying to work on an album in the midst of everything else that’s going on, work on the next album, yeah. Chal Ravens That’s exactly the answer we want to hear. Can we please give a warm hand for Mr. Larry Heard? [applause] Larry Heard Thank you, thank you all for coming.
[applause] Thank you. Thank you.

Title: Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez

Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez
Emerging in the early 2010s from Miami, Dominican-born Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez quickly made a name for himself in the world of reggaeton, global bass and rap. Studying, and eventually teaching, at SAE, Rodriguez earned a reputation as a reliable technician before moving into engineering. Taking inspiration from the bass-heavy sounds of the city he grew up in as well as the traditional music and early hip-hop he heard as a child, Rodriguez takes a simple approach to bringing music to life. He’s been nominated for three Grammys and has worked with the likes of Diplo, Daddy Yankee and Locos Por Juana, among many.
In this lecture at the Red Bull Music Academy presents Laboratorio La Havana 2019, Rodriguez discussed his beginnings, collaborations with Diplo and Yankee and revealed some of his key mixing and engineering philosophies.
Hosted by Serko Fu Welcome, Frank “El Médico.” It’s a pleasure to have you here. Many of us know you for your work as an engineer and producer on rap albums, Lapiz Consciente from the Dominican Republic, El B from Cuba, Eptos Uno from Mexico, La Mala Rodríguez from Spain, C. Tangana and a bunch of other names. For your Grammy nominations, and a lot of other stuff. But I’d like you to tell us who Frank “El Médico” is and what does he do? For those who don’t know yet. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez I was born Frank Rodríguez Santos, but they took that name away when I arrived in America. They call me “El Médico” because I started as tech in the studio, when I went to school. I attended SAE, I don’t know how many of you went there or know of it. They said there are two ways of getting into a studio: through the engineer door or through the tech door. And when I started I only knew how to record cassettes. When they played mixes on the radio, I pressed record so I could listen to them later. That was all I knew. Just that. And one day I said, “Well, I want to get into this, I’m not a musician, I’m not a good musician at all, but I know there’s another side to it, the engineering side, there are musicians on one side of the glass and engineers on the other.” So a teacher of mine told me, “You should work as a tech, fixing equipment and solving problems around the studio. And from there you can learn and, as they say, get your foot in the door.” So I started as a technician. And they called me last minute, as a last resort. So I arrived and said, “Oh, no, man, look, it’s this.” And that was it. The problem was solved. And one day there was a studio that had closed years ago, not years, but like a week and no one knew what the problem was. And they called me, “Come, see if you can fix this.” And I’d seen that problem already, so I got there, “Oh, no, man, look, it’s this.” Fixed. It had been closed for a week. So the guy said, “You came in here like a doctor.” And I liked the name so it stuck. So I went from tech to assistant to an engineer who needed to fix voices, or fix this or that, so “El Médico” thing kept going until it stuck. Frank “El Médico.” So I started working as engineer only, the first track... Well, I’ll cut it short. I worked a lot during the high point of reggaeton music, in the ’90s. In Miami, picture that. It was the heart of it. I met Toy, Toy Selectah, I knew Serko through Toy, too. Toy is like a nexus, many people know each other through him, and he was Machete’s A&R, it was reggaeton, all new reggaeton music was Machete. So I started getting into the world of reggaeton and working in what we call the urban world. I don’t know if you wanna... Serko Fu And on that topic, you working with reggaeton a lot, what did Frank “El Médico” listen to? Because you’re Dominican? Half in the Dominican Republic and half in Miami, or how was it? What did Frank “El Médico” listen to at home? What kind of music? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Merengue. Merengue and bachata. I mean, merengue at first, I can sing every merengue classic. Easy. Serko Fu Let’s hear it! Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez No. [laughs] Serko Fu So you actually can’t. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez [begins singing] No, wait. And that’s my base. But I also listened to Vico C. Because Vico C, “Me Acuerdo,” “Viernes 13”, or, you know, “Bomba.” He crossed over to Santo Domingo and took it by storm. Everyone knew “Me Acuerdo” by heart. I don’t know if you... Most of you are too young. You don’t know what that song was to Latin rap. Vico C with his ABC rap. Because at that time it was all, “I feel very happy...” Like, today Vico C doesn’t rap like that. He’s an eminence. Vico C can take whoever, whenever. One of the best rappers in history. He’s crazy, but he’s one of the best. But at that time it was like the beginning of our rap. Like the beginning of hip-hop and rap in the US, if you listen to the first rap song that came out, you’re like, “Ugh!” It sucks. I mean, a rap is, sometimes, “A-hip-hop, a-hippitipy-hop, dududu, dududu,” like, “Huh?” And today it’s completely different, but Vico C introduced rap and then Puerto Rico,
Ruben DJ, all those fanatics who introduced rap in Santo Domingo, and then the Dominicans started rapping too. So, merengue, but rap was always there, hip-hop was always there. And then I went to Miami, picture that, in Miami, Uncle Luke, 2 Live Crew, I was... Miami bass... I lived that time, the ’90s in Miami. I lived through a time in Miami in which if you didn’t own a soundsystem with window-shattering bass, you were nothing. If you got to school without a soundsystem in your car, park it all the way back so no one sees you and get into the school. The ones who came in with the system all “boom boom,” that was the real deal. Those were my ’90s in Miami. So that was my training in bass music. Serko Fu And, for instance, you mentioned you got the doctor nickname, but did you have any previous experience with production? Or any mentors outside of that? None? You just got there. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Yes. Serko Fu But why? I mean, wasn’t there something? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez The truth is I wanted to be a part of this. What you want to be part of too, the music scene. If I can’t be a creator, I want to help creators. That was my goal. I mean, I wanted to be part of that world. That’s it. That was my motivation. I would’ve been very happy being an engineer. But then you realize there’s a whole lot more, the other stuff, and you’re like, “Sh-t, I do want to do more.” You know... That’s how I felt. “I need to do more.” So I started producing. Recently. Like four or five years ago. Because with all the contacts I have now it’s not like I sit and make beats. I sit and I’m like, “Damn, that beat is cool. And that guy can follow this beat really well. Hey, look, I’ve got a beat for you. Get up here.” And I put together things like that. I don’t lie, that’s my production level. I mean, I connect people. Right now that’s part of my world, connecting people. “Hey, I have a beat that’s good for this and that, hey, look, I’ve got a beat for you.” And things happen. I really like that. And I started a record label too, that’s not urban rap. It’s more like electronic music, but not dubstep. I mean, more moombahton, more global bass. Serko Fu So you recently got into producing. What did you start with? What was your initial setup? Or what are you using now? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez I’ve always used Pro Tools. I don’t know, I know FL Studio and Ableton... I use Ableton when I have to. I’m technically an official Ableton trainer, certified. But I always use Pro Tools for everything I do. Be it mixing, mastering, and if I have to do some production... I’d rather get everything in Pro Tools and work there than in any other program. I’ve been using Pro Tools for 17 years. There’s nothing new to it anymore, it can’t surprise me. I mean, I know it all already. The other day it did surprise me. They released an update and they added a search box for the plugins, and I found it by mistake, I went looking for a plugin and a search box popped up, and I was like, “Oh! I can put the name in?” Ableton and FL Studio have had that since forever, and Pro Tools is always the last one to get the new features. You look for one and a long list comes up. So I thought, “Huh, Pro Tools is great.” Like three years ago Pro Tools got the offline bounce feature, so now you don’t have to wait out the whole song. You can hit offline bounce. And I was like, “Whoa!” And everyone else was like, “We had that ten years ago.” And I was like, “Yeah, but I just got it!” Serko Fu Do you remember which was the first song you worked on? Remember that session? Could you tell us a little about that? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Sure. At that time I was working on the Daddy Yankee album, El Cartel, and I was working on the Calle 13 album, Residente o Visitante, too. So my day was, I went to work in the school I studied at. From ten to five. Then I went to the studio that was like a block away. To work on the Yankee album. Because the engineer who was working told me, “Look, when you get here you have to do this, this and that.” I got there and worked. Did that from five to ten. And then I went to another studio where Calle 13 was. And I worked there. So one day, in that routine, at 3 AM Toy comes and tells me, “Hey, we’re done here, let’s go to this other studio to mix this song.” And picture that, I’d been up 23 hours straight and I was like, “Let’s go!” And it was Notch, I don’t know if you know him. Serko Fu Born Jamericans. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Born Jamericans, Notch [Norman "Notch" Howell]. And Toy had produced a song for Notch and had to mix his stuff that night. We go to this studio to mix it. And I was like, “Let’s go.” And boom, we get there, Red Bull, “Let’s go,” shout out Red Bull. And that was the first, and it became the first song I ever mixed, because three months later Notch calls me, “Hey, what’s your full name? What do you want for your credits?” And I was like, “Really?” And he asked my name like that, “What do you want in the credits?” “Put Frank, quote-unquote El Médico Rodriguez.” And he says, “OK.” And that’s how it went out. Those were the first mixing credits I ever got. I’ll never forget it, picture that, the first credits you get, because there’s a lot of time you work uncredited on many things. I mean, the stuff comes out and your name doesn’t get mentioned. Even if you worked on it. And Notch was nice enough to, three months later, “Hey I don’t have your name for the album credits.” And I was like, “Wow, dude, really?” And we’re friends to this day because of it. We talk all the time. If we can work, we work, but that really impressed me. And after that the ball got rolling. Serko Fu What song was it? What genre was it? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez It was like a cumbiaton, I don’t know the name. I know who it was, when it was, I can tell you how I felt that day… You know what happened that day? Serko Fu What? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez OK, that day I was working on that song. It’s 7 AM already. I’m like this [slumps in chair]. Like, “It’s fine, we’re wrapping up, it’s good.” So a guy walks in. And it was Itawe [Correa]. My first Grammy nomination was with a band called Locos Por Juana. I went to high school and middle school with Itawe. I mean, he walked in and I hadn’t seen him in 10 years. So I’m working the song, and I look up, and I see Itawe coming in, and I was like, “Itawe?” Well, I didn’t know he used that name back then, I knew him as Christian, I was like, “Christian!” and he was like, “Frank!” “Yeah!” “What are you doing here?” “What are you doing here?” “No, I’m a musician.” “Man, I’m an engineer!” “Really?” “Yeah, really!” So we reconnected after 10 years. Because I graduated in ’98, and we’re talking 2008 now. Ten years without seeing each other, man, and he walks in. And I was like, “OK...” “Oh, but you’re an engineer.” “Yeah, look, I’m mixing right now.” “Oh, OK, I’m working on an album.” “Oh, well, I’ll mix it for you.” “Really? Let’s do it, then. But look, there’s no budget.” And I was like, “Sure, sure. There’s never any budget.” I think I was paid like $2,000 for mixing 12 songs. And we mixed them like that, I got out of work at 10 PM, we went to a studio in the back of beyond and we spent the whole night mixing, and then I went back the next day to teach my class, so there was two months of that. Mixing the Locos Por Juana album. And that record got nominated for a Grammy. And that was like, “Oh, sh-t.” I mean, it was worth it, being there. I could’ve said to Toy, “Hey, I’m tired. I’ve been awake for 23 hours, I’m working on this, this and that... I’m tired, I’m going home to sleep.” But I said, “No, I’ll go and see what happens.” And that’s when Itawe walked in, and all that happened. And it was a nomination for the American Grammys, not the Latin Grammys. The Latin Grammys didn’t even see it. But the Americans nominated it for best alternative record, and I was like, “What?” I was in Mexico when I heard, with Milkman. Hyde called me. Hyde was the guy who brought me on the Daddy Yankee album. Hyde “The Chemist.” The real chemist. He was a student of mine. So he called me, “I’m doing Yankee’s album, and I think I can’t do it. I reached a point where I’m overwhelmed. Come help me.” And I was like, “Sure!” Uh! I’m working with him. So he was on the Grammy committee at that time. This happened many years ago. I don’t think he can get in trouble. I was in Mexico with Milkman. We were in a car, I don’t know where. And Hyde calls me, and I was like, “What happened?” and he says, “Hey, in two months you’ll get nominated for a Grammy.” And I was like, “Really?” “Yeah.” “What for?” “Locos por Juana.” “OK.” Serko Fu You went to get your suit. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez No, no, I was with Milkman. “What happened?” “I got nominated for a Grammy!” And Milkman, “Aaahhh!” Picture him, freaking out like that. Because we were like in the movies, “Aaaahhh!” We went out drinking that night with Kiki Flow. A bar owned by a guy called Kiki Flow. We got so drunk that night! And two months later the nominations get announced, and so it was. Nominated for a Grammy. And now? What happens now? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. They give you a piece of paper, you can say you got nominated, and to the day I die I’m Grammy-nominated. That’s it. That’s what I learned from that. If you get nominated for a Grammy, or you win whatever, if you sit down, “Oh, I won a Grammy.” Very well. And now? What are you going to do? Are you going to use that Grammy for something? I mean... What’s next? Nothing? Well, you’re screwed. No one cares. Do you know how many Grammys a year they give out? 98. In one year, the Americans. The Latin give out like 64 Grammys. You’re one of 64. And it’s an honor and everything. But they give out Grammys for the best children’s album. I mean, they give Grammys for that, they give Grammys for best read book, “I have a Grammy because I read a book really well.” Very well. It’s true, Barack Obama got a Grammy. Today, President Obama has a Grammy because he read a book and they gave him a Grammy. For “Best Read Book.” OK. I mean, a Grammy is really cool and everything, but... If you sit down, “I won a Grammy,” it’s worthless. You have to always be thinking about what’s next. What’s next. What’s next. “Another Grammy.” OK, let’s go. What’s next? You can never lie down. “Oh, I’ve got a number one hit!” Very well. What’s next? How many bands can’t get out of that one hit they did and disappear? Because they lie down, “I’ve got a number one hit already, I can’t top that.” No, man. What’s next? And that’s what I learned from that. Very well, it felt cool and all, what’s next? What’s next was more nominations, b-tch, what? Serko Fu They’re coming. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez No, I’ve got them. I’ve got them already, man. Serko Fu Coming back to that, what’s next? When you did that thing you said was cumbiaton, that you don’t remember the name of, it’s worth mentioning… Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez I feel bad. Serko Fu But cumbiaton, what year was that? 2003? ’04? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez I think so. Yeah, around 2004. Serko Fu That was the time of reggaeton, that boom. For example, that was cumbiaton. And back then the whole mixing genres thing wasn’t so standardized. Cumbia with urban music... Did you see it coming? I mean, did you see that? Because you’re working with a lot of people nowadays, right? I mean with people who weren’t from that scene, but they were nourished by it. I’m talking about Major Lazer, or J Balvin, or, you know, Diplo, Dillon Francis, that crowd. I mean, did you see it coming, or did you have an inkling? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez No, not really. Toy saw it coming. He totally did. Because Toy was one of the first who mixed reggaeton’s roots with cumbia. That is, he put dembow in cumbia. Several who saw it coming, obviously. Hijo de la Cumbia saw it coming. I didn’t. I mean, I was there. I worked with Diplo because Diplo spoke with Toy, he told him, “Hey, I’m recording an album, but it’s like reggaeton. Do you have someone who that can do that?” “Look, Frank.” And Diplo spoke to me. So that resulted in moombahton. And I was like, “What is this?” I liked it right away. Straight up. That was Major Lazer, Diplo’s EP, another EP of his, the Express Yourself, and another EP he released that was like a compilation. I mean, I loved that genre. And Diplo is responsible for moombahton being what it is today. Because he worked at it until he hit gold. And from then on everyone is doing moombahton. I mean, don’t tell me “Taki Taki” isn’t moombahton. Don’t tell me “Lean On” isn’t obviously moombahton. Everyone is using slow dembow. Like pop. And they’re not realizing that they’re doing moombahton. But the first moombahton hit was “Bumaye,” I mixed it. But I didn’t realize that was coming. I mean, I loved that stuff from the beginning. But I didn’t know it was what was coming. Today, I started my label and it’s kind of a moombahton label, because I had so much access to it, and many kids sent me moombahton stuff and I was like, “Well, let’s set up a label, because
people are sending me stuff...” And no one is paying attention to these people, to the kids, because they’re new, because they don’t have clout, because they don’t have 50,000 followers on Instagram. They’re not paying attention to them. I’ll pay attention. And let’s see what kind of noise we can do on our own. And it’s a global thing. For example, I have two Chilean kids. Where’s the Chilean guy? I have two Chilean kids who are great. I have one from Costa Rica, too. Where’s the Costa Rican? I have one from Costa Rica who’s called Bombocat and he’s great. Really good. I took him to EDC now. And he played at EDC. He was the only Costa Rican playing at EDC. And last year I took two Chileans. They were the only Chileans playing at EDC. And what they’re doing is, taking moombahton, and putting their own local flavor in. Because someone from Costa Rica doing moombahton puts their own local flavor in. Just like Chile, just like Spain. Beauty Brain is great. Really great. And you can tell they have other influences. It’s moombahton, but with other influences. And that’s what I love about global bass. That cumbiaton is a part of global bass. Because people take cumbia, put their own local flavor in, and then it’s different. An Argentinian cumbia compared to a Mexican cumbia, but with global bass down there. And now it’s getting more urban, because now it’s more lyrical. Before it was more about the beat. Now it’s more about putting voices in, not so lyrical but simpler and with voices, so people can relate to it, and it’s kind of a radio genre now. For better or for worse. Serko Fu Hey, talking about that, about mixing rhythms, I don’t know, since the beginning, like you said, since the first rap songs in the US, if they were ABC or whatever, they sampled funk or soul or whatever they had at hand, right? And years passed and perhaps in Spain they sampled flamenco, right? In Argentina they took tango, cumbia in Colombia, mariachi in Mexico, whatever. Do you think there’s something missing? Is there something coming that got away from us? Something that hasn’t been used yet? Or do you not want to tell me because you’re keeping the secret. For the clinic. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez No. The ’80s. What I’m seeing is, it’s a decade thing. And they’re like two decades behind. For example, in the ’90s they were sampling the ’60s. I mean, everything that’s happening with Motown, the ’60s and the ’70s. Then it moves forward. Now they’re sampling the ’90s. I mean, they’re sampling B.I.G. and 2Pac. They’re sampling them to make new stuff. But they skipped the ’80s. I mean, it happened, obviously. P. Diddy didn’t sample, because that wasn’t sampling, when he did that song “Every Breath You Take,” that wasn’t sampling, he took the song and put some drums underneath, and boom! We’re off. But I haven’t heard many songs that sampled the ’80s. Like the ’80s flow, the ’80s sound, that was more synth... And it could be, that now that’s what’s happening. But they’re using sounds from the ’80s but new, I don’t feel like they’re sampling the ’80s. And that’s coming. People are going to start sampling the ’80s like crazy. I’m not talking about little sounds, but entire hooks. And it could be interesting, we’ll see. Serko Fu So you know, right to the ’80s library. All the hits. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez No, man, wait! Did you see a plugin called RX 7? OK. There’s a plugin by iZotope called RX 7. Yesterday I was with DJ Manuvers, I don’t know if you know him, Pancho. I was with Pancho and we were talking about an idea he has for a record, and it was like romantic songs from the ’60s and ’70s. And the bad thing is, it’s impossible to find those sessions nowadays. Man, with this plugin, you can basically take out the acapella. I mean, you load it... I wish I had it there. You load the song into the plugin. It’s not a plugin, it’s a program. You load the song into the program. And it has four sliders. It says, “vocals,” “bass,” “percussion,” “other.” If you lower “vocals” you get an instrumental. It removes it completely from your track. If you say,
“No, what I want is the acapella,” you lower the other three, and it’s just the acapella. So you’re like, “No, I just can’t believe it.” It cleans it like that. And it has sensitivity, so if you notice
something got left behind, you turn the sensitivity up until it cleans it completely. And it’s amazing. Flat out impressive. And what he was saying, that’s the truth, is that before you had to sample it in its entirety, “Oh, I like this little bit.” But it had a bit of vocals, a bit of bass, a bit of percussion. Now you can say, “I like this bit, but I only like the violins.” And you have just the violins. And you sample the violins and no one will notice. No one will notice, because it’s just a violin sample that has nothing else in it. I mean, it doesn’t have a bit of the vocals, so it’s, “Oh, that came from this song.” It’s just the violins. And who can say you didn’t play that violin with Kontakt? I ended up like, “Pancho, I wasn’t thinking about that, but it’s true.” Ah, no, I want a bassline. “OK.” You get only the bass, you have a song’s complete bassline, and you’re left with the little bits you want and no one can say that it came from that song. Edit that out of the video, please. Take that out. [laughs] Frank “El Médico’s” opinions. But look it up, it’s called RX 7. From iZotope, RX 7. Look for the video. When you see the demo video you’re like, “How much does it cost? Crack it!” Serko Fu On that subject, let’s speak of something a bit more technical, I mean, if you don’t have that plugin, what does Frank “El Médico” use to sample? What’s your process? I know you’re using Pro Tools, and you’re using Ableton, but how would that go? Can you show us or tell us a bit about it? Or you don’t want to share secrets from the operating room? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez There are no secrets. Let’s see, who are the producers here? How much sampling do you do nowadays? For real. audience member It depends on if it’s Batalla de los Gallos, or if it is for artists... Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez That is, if it’s a production track, a track you want to sell, you prefer not to sample? audience member Or maybe we sample, but very elaborately, very edited. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Yes, so you can’t tell where it came from for obvious legal reasons, right? Yes, that’s the problem. That’s why when they send me a song that has sampling I send it back. There are systems and stuff... I even saw a website the other day that says, we can clear any sample you want, no problem. It costs this much. But if you don’t pay a lot of money to clear the sample, they take almost the whole song. Because, “No, you didn’t pay a lot,” then 50% of the earnings go to us, or more. And you’re basically left with nothing. I mean, you did all the work. That’s what happened to, I think RJD2, or another guy, who did a song, and they used it in a show. It was the opening song of the show. It was with Mad Men, or something like it that went viral. Serko Fu RJD2. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez And they took almost all the money because of the sample. From the song, because it had a sample. RJD2 produces like that, with sampling. And they took almost everything, because he sampled. And because he didn’t clear it beforehand, you’re left in the lurch, it’s like anything they want. Because if they say, “No, I want 80% of the royalties,” and you say, “No,” then it can’t be used. You’re left with nothing. That’s why I prefer not to sample. Or, if you sample, do it so they can’t tell, and that’s hard, because there are some sharks now who can tell that came from that song from that year, like that. And that’s what it is. I don’t know where they came from, but they’re a living music library. It can be a “Beep!” and they say, “Ah, that came from that album, and it’s that.” And you’re like, “Wow, dude, seriously?” No, and YouTube is even worse now. Worse. I’ve uploaded things that had like two seconds of something and it says, “This belongs to this person.” And they remove it whole, because two seconds of your song has a small sample by whoever. I prefer not to sample, really. Or sampling it like that, like with that plugin. Because that plugin changes the information for you. I keep at it with the plugin. Edit that part. [laughs] Serko Fu In a bit we’re going to have a Q&A. Well, and in the case where you take a sample, because you can sample yourself, things you have the rights to, how do you process it? How do you play with it? Where? Can you explore that a bit? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Mainly in Pro Tools, obviously, filters, right? Depending on what you want. I’ve made things, and I usually do it to master. Sometimes. Because sometimes they send you a song, or not, to mix. So I sample their sample. That is, for example, they send a song where most of it is a sample. A piano loop, for example. And that’s the song’s base. But they never did a bass, or they’re trusting that the sample has most of the bass, right? And it’s not working. That happened to me recently with a piano loop that was like the base of a song. And it doesn’t work, because if I turn up the bass it takes away the piano. So, I had to take the piano, duplicate the piano, take out everything that isn’t bass from it, and process that duplicate as if it were a bass, then I take the bass from that duplicate. But at the same time you can’t leave the bass on the original piano. If you leave it, then it clashes with the bass and you have a different problem. You have to process the other piano channel to take away all the bass you can without it being noticeable and mix it with the original, and make a sort of Frankenstein with both things. With this one I take out the bass and with this one I take out the brightness, and here we have a sample again, but, you know, renewed, or something. Regarding sampling, most of what I do is that, using the sample so the original sample sounds better. Which usually it doesn’t, because when they sample they usually do it at random, “Oh, I liked that part. OK.” You didn’t do a good job when you sampled it, man, what happened? And now it sounds very bright. That is, you have to fix it, you have to work at it. That’s why I don’t like sampling. Serko Fu Hey, you’re touching on a topic that’s very interesting to me. To us, say producers, rappers. We send something to mix, how do we avoid making you mad? That is, how do we make some stems or a group of channels? What’s the best way? Or, how do you like to work? Can you share a bit of that? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Yes. Good question. Let’s see. First of all, it’s more important when you record that you turn up the monitor’s volume rather than the mixer’s. That is, if you can’t hear yourself, turn up the monitor’s volume. It’s more important to the recording process. Because if you send it to me, for example, to mix, I can do more with less, than if you send a thing like, I call it an elephant leg. I can do almost nothing with that. The only thing I can do is turn it down. And trying to fit it where it goes. That is, “Ah, I can’t hear myself.” Turn up the monitor. “Ah, I still can’t hear myself.” Turn down the instrumental. Not everything is upwards. Turn down the instrumental. Can you hear yourself better? Put whatever you want. Try not to record things that get stuck there forever. There’s people who like to record with Auto-Tune, for example. If you like the Auto-Tune, record with the Auto-Tune, very well. But don’t record it over the vocal. There are ways. For example, in Pro Tools I can record, with the plugin on, but without applying it. Then if tomorrow I say, “You know what, we should tune it, so we don’t have Auto-Tune,” I can do it. But if you recorded it with Auto-Tune, well man, you have to record it again, because it’s in there. If you don’t want to stick with a process, don’t record it. It’s preferable to record it clean, or record two versions. I do that too. “Oh, no, we want it with Auto-Tune.” OK, two channels, exactly the same, one with the process and one without. Mute the one without the process. Then you have the clean one, and you have the process. And if tomorrow you say, “I didn’t like it,” you have it there. And if you send it for mixing, that’s the worse thing you can do to a mixer. To send something processed, because then I have to work to take off that process, if in the end it doesn’t fit, which is very hard. To that point. Specially if you have reverbs or delays, there are plugins that can be used for that. I have plugins that take the reverb off of the vocals. But if it doesn’t have it, better yet. And I can add it. That is, permanent things like that, it would be good not to have them. To give me space. In the instrumental, there are two versions. Try not to take things out. Let’s say you’re very happy with how the instrumental sounds. I like the balance I did, I just want it to sound better. In the master they usually have a couple plugins, an iZotope, whatever. Usually, “Send me stems to mix,” and they go to the master and take all that out. What happens is that when you remove all that it unbalances everything. It doesn’t sound the same. In that case I usually say, “Leave it exactly like it is, send me the stems like that.” Because you’re already more or less happy. You just want it to sound better, but you’re happy with what you have. Then, leave what you have there, ideally, after doing the stems, you grab the stems, and put them in a session, press play, and it sounds the same as the session from which you got them. If it sounds the same, perfect. Then send them and whoever mixes it then works on that and it’s going to sound better. But try not to take all the plugin chain off, because the one mixing it will make it sound better. But the problem is that you already have a month listening to the song that way. Then what you want is for the person to get into your head, hear it the way you have been hearing it for a month, and get it right. It’s like you put a basketball hoop on the other side of the street, and I shoot from here. Remember the Michael Jordan ad with the reverb? Like, off here, over here, off here, nothin’ but net. That’s what you want me to do. To shoot the ball from here, and that’s not going to happen. No matter how good I am, it’s not going to happen. What could happen is, either I nailed it, and it sounds exactly like you had it, or I didn’t, and that’s 90% of the time, or I make it sound better, which is 0.03% of the time. And not because I can’t, because I’m better at it than you. But because you already have an idea of how you want it to sound. And you know that music is subjective. For example, I like kicks that hit hard. But there are a lot of beats I mix that the first thing they tell me is, “Lower the kick.” And I’m like, “But why? It sounds awesome.” “No, in this beat the kick has to be softer.” “Actually, take some punch away from the kick.” And I’m like, “What?” It’s like telling me to kill myself. “Take some punch away from the kick, kill yourself, Frank.” So I’ve to go against my nature of giving punch to the kick. Because you already have an idea of what you want. Then I’ve to get into that idea and try to improve it. I mean, send it exactly as you like it, and the one doing the mix will mix whatever he’s going to mix to make it sound better. Which is usually just organizing frequencies. It’s not an arrangement. It’s organizing frequencies, unless they want an arrangement. But usually, “Ah, the bass clashes here, and this, and that...” So it sounds bigger, better, and so on. That’s usually the process of mixing and mastering. But you’re already happy. Producers here know how to mix. Everyone knows how to mix. Because they already have years listening to and working with music and they know how they want things to sound. Right? And it’s the same with the vocals. You know how you want your voices to sound. Send in a good reference, always. Always, always, always, always. I should’ve started with that. Send in a good reference of how you want it to sound. And tell them, “Make it sound better with this reference.” But everything starts with the reference. Specially with the volume arrangement of how you want everything. Serko Fu The capture volume. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Exactly. The kick here, this and that. I know, it has to sound bigger but with the same volume arrangement. OK? Serko Fu About recording vocals. I know you now have the Apollo and so on, maybe in the studio you have pre-amplifiers, compressors... Well, for anyone, what would be a chain you would recommend? How do you do your vocals normally? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez You have to adapt to the artist. Because, for example, La Mala, she likes to record with a lot of things in the channel. Compressor, equalizer, reverb, this, that, that other thing. She basically wants the vocal to sound finished when it’s recorded. It’s like, “Oof! Here we go!” No, it’s always like that. It’s like mixing while recording. And I already have a chain made for her. When I record her, “OK, I have to open this chain because she likes to sound like the final version.” That is, the vocals have to sound finished. Hard, up front, very clear, with effects, that is, finished. She loves that. There are people, like El B, for example, he records himself. He just sends me the stuff. And he has almost nothing on the recording chain. Because he has a very strong voice. So when he goes up to the mic, he projects exactly what he wants to record. The chain depends absolutely on who’s recording and how they want to hear themselves while being recorded. But the basics are, I always put in my cue on top, a compressor below that, sometimes a limiter below that, because sometimes it goes over, and you know, for those times it goes over, and some type of effect, like... And we’re talking about a minimal process. A little brightness, so it stands out, compression no more than 3dB, if you’re at 6dB of compression in the input channel, it’s bad. Because that’s a process you won’t be able to remove. And it’ll be noticeable. When they turn it up the push-back will be there. It’s bad. So it’s better to back up on the pre-amp. 3dB is OK. Because it gives you control. And usually I’ve the limiter there to make it sound better. I mean, not even to process stuff. You know, like those limiters that as you turn them down the volume goes up. I put it there, it sounds better and I can control the input and output level, so that they sound great, and any effect you want to have there. Do not record with the [Waves] CLAs. They have noise that you can’t take out. I don’t know why not. They should have a switch, usually that analog noise they put in plugins, that white noise is always there. And all good plugins usually have a switch to turn that noise off. But the CLAs don’t have that switch. I’ve seen sessions that have 14 CLAs, and it’s like, “Tsss! I don’t know where all that noise is coming from!” From the 14 CLAs you have in there. Then they do the stems with the 14 CLAs in there. When I get the stems, you play the first stem, and the first thing I have to do is clean that up. Because if it sounds hard now, after me that sound is going to be harder still. That is, it’s going to really be there. So I’ve to clean it, first of all. That is, CLAs for recording... If you have to use them, use them, but take into account that sound. I would use a couple. You know, I wouldn’t go nuts with the CLAs. You know what I mean. CLA. Serko Fu Talking about the noise when you have several channels, what do you recommend? How do you usually work the vocal stems? If you have a main, two ad-libs, how would that work? I know you adjust each one, but, how? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Usually when I’m producing, recording, for example, I try to record the minimum number of voices possible. Because it reaches a point it becomes a hassle, to be dealing with 40 vocal channels when in the end they don’t add... Serko Fu What one good recording does. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Exactly. That’s what I learned once, working with Hyde. Remember that song with Wisin
and 50 Cent? Awesome, right? Wisin had a lot of vocal channels. That is, to reach the sound Wisin had in those times you needed several channels for vocals. Now he has a different system. He gets to where he needs to get without having to record as much. In those times there were like 20 vocals channels. 50 Cent sent two. “Hey, Doc! Download the WeTransfer from 50 Cent’s people.” “OK.” I download the WeTransfer. Then I see where it says the MB and it says like 70MB. “It’s corrupt. This has to be compressed.” I download it... Open the zip, two voice channels. And we’re talking about one channel, and then the other channel, “Yeah!” Like highlights. So I was like, “Hyde, he sent two channels, and one is highlights.” “Really?” “Yes.” “OK, let’s get it in!” Awesome! I mean, awesome! That day I said, “You know, I’m going to focus in life on recording the fewest number of vocals possible, but in a damn good take.” Because it’s really much better, it sounds cleaner. Afterwards Lil Wayne started to do it too, he picked up that style. One take, with highlights. But the take is, boom! In your face. Good recording, very clean, very good all around. And it’s more effective to have a really good take with highlights here, a reinforcement here and there, so, six channels for vocals, tops. And it has more of an impact, well recorded, than 40... [notices cameras] We’re filming, damn. OK, before, not now, before! Daddy Yankee recorded like 60 channels for vocals. 60 channels. I mean, “Give me another take! Give me another take!” And it was like, “Dude, we have to mix this afterwards.” 60 channels. And an entire channel was like, “What!” Just that. That was the channel. And it was like, but why...? We told him, “Raymond, remember when you were with Playero, you only had one channel, because the recording had two music channels, one for vocals, one for highlights. Remember those times?” “Yes, but bro, we use Pro Tools now, and you know we can go all the way.” And like that, for El Cartel there were sessions that were channel after channel after channel. He now changed that process, as well. Now if you listen to Yankee he changed that process. We’re looking for a really good take, highlights, this and that, and that’s it! One good highlights channel works better than 14 vocals. One channel, like they do now. You’ve a great channel, and you’ve a great highlight, to fill up the spaces. Serko Fu It complements you. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Exactly. It’s a good highlights channel. That is hard, but a good highlights channel works better than 14 vocal channels. Just as filling. To make it feel full. No. Make a good channel. You know who does that right? Fuego. Fuego does that really well. When you record him he records and gives you the first channel. If you see Fuego writing, it’s impressive because he doesn’t write anything. He’s there, “OK, play the beat.” “Mami!” “Ferrari!” And you go, “Where is this going?” Then, “OK, keep the ‘mami’, ‘Ferrari’, this and that.” You press play. “Come here mami!” “Get on the Ferrari!” Huh? It’s like a jigsaw puzzle. And there are empty spaces. And you’re like, “OK, I see where we’re going, but there are empty spaces, what are you going to do?” “Give me another channel.” “Yeah! Let’s get to the Ferrari.” “Let’s get going.” And you’re like, “F---!” And when you check you have two, three vocal channels and it’s great. This guy is a f-cking genius. But he kills you with three channels. That would be a good exercise. Let me do it with three, four channels, do what I have to do. The hook is different. We’re talking about the verses. If you want to have 60 channels for vocals in the hook, OK! Go for it! If it’s good filling and sounds great and all, OK. But for the verses, less is more, and that way they have contrast, too. Because there’s a hook, wow! And then the verse comes. It calms down. And it leaves space so it’s dynamic. Many songs are not dynamic, it’s like a back-to-back solo. Things like that, they feel better, it feels like it doesn’t tire you out. Serko Fu Do you think that things are going that way? You say that person did it and Wayne started doing it, or more people, do you think it has to do with the course the music is taking? Instrumentals let you have that dynamic. Speaking of trap, or urban, which gives you that space, do you think it’s related? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez I think it’s like the chicken or the egg thing. Rappers started to do that, and producers, “Ah, so we’re doing it this way. Let’s do the beats like this, that allow for and have space for that kind of thing.” I like it more. I mean, personally. Also it’s hard for a producer to know when to back down. I’ve been sent many songs that sound like the producer and the rapper are fighting. And so I tell them, “It sounds like you’re fighting.” “Why?” “Because you’re over there doing whatever you want, and he’s over there doing whatever he wants, and afterwards you shared the files, put them in a session one on top of the other and sent them to me like that.” They’re not talking. The beat is strong. The rapper is strong. And no one gives anyone space. That is, the producer has to have the awareness to go, “You know what? I have to take these elements out because the vocals go here.” And the vocals are part of the beat. Then we can turn this up here, take this out here, add this here, but if you make a beat and never touch it, that’s another thing. If you made a beat and they recorded over it and you never touch the beat again, you’re not producing. That’s not producing. That’s making beats. Ah, you made the beat, the vocals got in there, now pick up those vocals, get them into the beat and then finish the song. Make it a song. Take things out, add things, I’m not talking about producing new things. No. Little things. Here and there. Things you can feel. OK, let me get in the middle of the vocals, here’s a space, let me get this thing here, take this from here so it doesn’t clash. I mean, now it’s when you have to produce. The beat is the start. How many bars were in a beat in the ’90s? In the beginning when you asked a producer for a beat in the ’90s there were 16 bars. Every beat Timbaland did, the “Fade to Black” beat, when Jay-Z and Timbaland entered the studio… Yankee’s album was mixed in that studio. El Cartel. The purple one. I spent three months there. I didn’t want to see purple again in my life. “Come, play some beats!” 16 bars. That’s it. He didn’t play anything else. Another beat. 16 bars. And it wasn’t like he didn’t want to play anything else. That was it. There’s 16 bars. Then they came, played 16 bars for three minutes, Jay-Z or whoever came, recorded, then, “Now we’re going to produce.” Get the acapella, throw it there, throw all the beat elements, let’s add new elements, take out things, add things, this, and that. I mean, today, I say to a kid, “Give me a beat.” Three minutes and I’m, “Damn! That’s not a beat. That’s an entire song.” It’s like they don’t understand that, man, you’ll to have to do that over. That is, you save the acapella, but work it again, put it there, take out things, add things... Make it into a song. Because it’s not a song. Right now it’s a beat tied to a vocal. Get it? Serko Fu We get it. Speaking of being in a studio for three months working with a bunch of renowned artists, not only on that album, but on many, any stories you want to share? Don’t name names if you don’t want. Anything crazy that happened on a session? I’m looking for the safest one. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Ahh, well... Would he still work security there? Because we were working so many hours, we did a thing we called “the Krugers.” If you fell asleep, if at any point you fell asleep for any reason there was always like... It was always Hyde, Gocho, me, the assistant, we were great friends. Imagine, three months, 18 hours per day. We formed really strong bonds. The same assistant, always. And Yankee’s security guy. Yankee got there at six in the afternoon, Yankee’s wife came every once in a while. We were like eight people always. The producers, one of the producers always got there. Tiny, or Nelly, there was always someone there. So if you fell asleep, everyone would stand around you, very quietly. “Hey, Kruger.” And everyone stopped what they were doing. Stood around you. And yelled your name. Let’s say it was Gocho. “Gocho!” And he was like, “Ah! What happened?” That was the thing. When it was my turn, they got a car inside the studio’s lobby and I was lying down facing the door, they get the car in, “Médico!” And I wake up, they honk the horn and turn the headlights on. I thought I was in the middle of the street. I swear. Afterwards we did it to the security guy. No, I lie! Gocho fell asleep, and the security guy did too. Then we were about to do the Kruger to Gocho, because he was the only one we hadn’t gotten yet. He didn’t fall asleep, because he was the one getting the most sleep. Gocho left early, slept eight hours and came back. So, it was Gocho’s turn. “Hey, it’s Gocho’s turn!” So the security’s asleep over there, and here is Gocho. And everyone... “Gocho!” And he goes like this. But the security, “Oh, damn!” And throws a pillow. And he was the security guy! “Can we pretend this never happened?” I said, “Man, what happened?” “I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to talk about it. I had a weird dream. I had a weird dream.” And I was like, “Yes, you really did.” After that, no more Kruger. And another day, the assistant had long hair. And we convinced the studio manager to write a memo saying we had to cut our hair. If we wanted to keep working there we had to get our hair cut. But official, an official memo. And he gave it to everyone. And everyone in the studio knew it was bullsh-t. Everyone but the studio’s assistant. So the memo came, and everyone was talking about the memo. Every studio worker, “Hey, what’s up with that memo?” And the guy,
“I don’t know what I’m going to do. I think I’m leaving. I think this is it for me.” And the last one. With Hyde. Because Hyde used to smoke a lot in the studio. So we made the studio manager send a bill for smoke damage to the studio totaling $5,000. Official. Signed by the manager. So Yankee had to do it. We said, “Yankee, we have this for Hyde.” After three months working in a studio... After one month, the mission was to screw with each other. He says, “It’s Hyde’s turn.” Because Hyde was like a professional. He got everyone. He was the professional. So we made the bill, and the one to give it to Hyde was Yankee. He said, “Look, here. Let’s talk.” With a really straight face. The best performance I saw in my life. He took him elsewhere. To where we recorded. And we were in the control room. Pretending like we were talking among ourselves, but looking on. And I saw Yankee... You only saw that. And he gives him the envelope, and you see Hyde opening it. Man, you... And then Hyde comes back, “Man... This can’t be.” I said, “What happened?” “They want to charge me $5,000 for smoke damage... Everyone smokes here! I’m not the only one who smokes here!” I tell him, “No, Hyde, the only one who smokes in the studio is you.” “No, lies, I’ve seen you smoking here!” It was a mess for three days. Three days. He was convinced for three days that he had to pay $5,000 to the studio for smoke damage. The third day he goes to Trevor, the studio manager, “Look, what can we do, a payment plan, give me a payment plan, I can’t pay it.” And Trevor was like, “What are you talking about? Are they still keeping that up?” “No, that was a joke.” “What?!” It was a good thing, he was clean for three days! Can you imagine, desperate for three days, “Where would I get $5,000 from?” Serko Fu Well, let’s hear it for my brother Frank “El Médico” please, who was here sharing some of his adventures. [applause] Let’s move on to some questions. Point and shoot. Do we have a mic there, or do you want this one? Audience member I have two technical questions, very fome. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Fome? What is fome? Audience member Boring. The first one is, what suggestions do you have for plugins to open up a song, and... Just that, actually. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez I learned that late. The answer to that question. It’s very important to use plugins that help the track’s harmonics. You know the plugin opens up the song, in a way. That is, it only opens up what is there. But for example... iZotope has it. How is it called? Harmonic Enhancer. Yes, Harmonic Exciter. Those are more important than anything else. That is, you can make a song feel 3D with Harmonic Enhancer. You can pick any other plugin that has a widener. You can feel it, but you can’t at the same time. You have to be careful, though, because you can go overboard. Usually I use it for high frequencies. I usually don’t do anything to the medium and low ones. That is, don’t add too much to the low ones, try not to open the low frequencies either. Usually what I do is, in the same plugin, I make mono the frequencies that are 70Hz or lower. Because they truly have to be mono. And then as they go up you can start opening them up. And the high frequencies, we’re talking about 12 up, you can really open them. And it’s going to feel 3D. Audience member There’s a process called frequency masking, that tries to take advantage of auditory masking to work the samples. You can open the samples, not have them sound like the original sample of the song masking that frequency, with the error you can have, you have to pick it up and take advantage of it to the max have it work for you so you can use the harmonic exciters and the frequency masking. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Yes, but you have to do it well. It’s not like, “Do it there, put in a preset.” No. Use it, start trying things, and when you think it sounds good, save that as a preset, and then try a different thing on the same song until it gets to the point where it does sound great. But the harmonic exciters are very important right now. I usually have two or three in my master. Not all the way. I like to do things like, when you do compression, instead of doing a 12dB compression, I have three giving four. Then the first one gives you four, so you add the other one, and you already have a compressed signal, and it’s not pushing that hard. It pushes less. And the other one pushes even less. And it gives you the same amount of compression, but it’s not as noticeable. So I generally use several. Because there are some that are very good for the mid frequencies. Like the tube ones. Tube harmonic enhancers are very good for mid and low frequencies. There are others like the iZotope one that are very good for high frequencies but I don’t like them for the low ones. There’s another one... From a company called BrainWorx. All BrainWorx plugins, all of them, are excellent. All of them. There’s one called XL. It’s very good. I only know one way to use it. It has a button that says 0 to 100. I put 100 and that’s that. I leave it. I put it in the master at 100 and continue. Then I start working. That’s that, it’s going to do what it’s going to do, and then, instead of adjusting the plugin, I adjust the mix. Audience member I don’t know if you know it, I’ve been searching many years for a plugin that did this. You look for a blank space with noise, the typical hiss that you have to cancel out, right? And there was a software before, Cool Edit Pro, very good for the ’90s. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Yes, it’s called Adobe Audition, today. Audience member Right, and it doesn’t exist, they deleted a very good effect, you uploaded that sound, the hiss, it memorized it and then filtered out everything else. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez X-Noise, RX-Noise... Audience member But those are Waves. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez No, no. X-Noise is Waves. RX-Noise is iZotope’s. RX-Noise and RX De-Noise. Wait up. [looks at computer] But X-Noise is very good for that. Noise Reduction... Yes. RX. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, RX Spectral Noise. You select that space, you press “learn,” it learns to recognize the noise, then you select the whole track, clean. And you can control how much you take out. Because if you take out a lot it sounds like it’s underwater. But when you’ve learned the noise, it cleans not only the blank space, but all of it. Which is what I have to do when these punks put CLA everywhere. Serko Fu Any other questions? Audience Member Yes, I have two. I think you said less is more a lot. Is that true? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Yes. Audience Member Because I’ve always disliked that guy who has 200 million plugins downloading, “Look, I’ve 47 billion gigabytes of I’m not sure what for,” but then you listen to it and say, “Well, I don’t know, maybe I don’t get it, but I don’t like it.” I think there’s a moment in which you did this and that, so less is more? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Yes, I mix everything here. [points at laptop] Everything, everything. Not only that, I mix everything here and with headphones. Everything I’ve mixed, absolutely everything. My only mix nominated for a Grammy that wasn’t with headphones, was the Locos Por Juana album. Apart from that, everything I’ve done, nominated or not, it was here, in this situation. That laptop. Audience Member What headphones does he have then? That’s the question! Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez I have a $5,000 pair... No, no, no! Look, the headphones I use were discontinued. So I browse Amazon, every time there’s a pair, they cost no more than $50, I buy three. So I have three at home, in the box. For when they break, because they break a lot. When they break, I pick up another pair and continue. They’re in my backpack! They’re in my backpack, and I’ve a little paper back here that if I don’t put it in, it doesn’t work. I swear! Look, here it is, I swear! If I don’t put the little paper in, it doesn’t turn on or connect to this. audience member That makes me happy. The main rule of the elements of the sound chain is that the fewer things you have, the better the sound. The fewer sound elements you have, the fewer compressors, if you have good raw sound, the best quality you will have at the moment of doing the mix. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Right. audience member That is the first rule of sound. audience member In the end, when we want to fatten the sound right, someone will do the master and they will have their State Logic with their €90,000… It’s like buying the baskets to play at Madison Square Garden. If the Knicks want me, they’ll buy the baskets for me. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez I bought an SSL channel plugin, from Plugin Alliance, which is awesome. And I put it in now, I do some sort of master, I put in bass, or kicks, if I have three kicks they all go there. I put the SSL plugin. I remove the noise, because, obviously. Bye noise. And there! This is my console. If I have to put in another plugin under there, I put in another plugin, But I’ve used SSL, it sounds awesome compared to the SSL [desk]. It’s not an SSL [desk] but it sounds great, the EQ sounds awesome compared to the SSL [desk]. Compression sounds awesome compared to the SSL [desk]. Everything is very close together. I start like that, and sometimes I have nothing else in that channel. I put in the SSL plugin, I have a little compression there, I have EQ, and a little filter if I need a little filter, and that’s all it takes. That’s what I learned over the years. I work with a guy from the Barbados. He’s called Static. He does a lot of soca. Very into soca. I trust him to the point of, there are things in the soca genre I don’t understand, so I put my session in Dropbox, and I give him access. So I work, and he tells me, “Yes, it sounds cool. Just, there are some sounds you have to pan, they’re very us.” I go, “OK.” Open the session, pan it, and I close it. Then he closes it, I open it here and finish it. He always says the same thing, “I don’t understand how it is that you have four plugins and you have that sound, and I’ve to put in plugin after plugin after plugin to get there.” Because, bro, that’s the right plugin. You don’t need a plugin chain like that. You need one or two. What are we doing? Equalizing, compressing and doing whatever sounds best. It’s what we’re doing, at the end of the day. I mean, why would I put in ten plugins to do what I can do with two? And if you see my session, it’s like that. It’s like, look, this, this, this, this. Sometimes I tell myself, “Damn, I should make this more complex.” Because it looks very silly right now. I’m looking and it’s like I haven’t done anything. And it’s like I want to make it complex. I do put in a lot of plugins in the vocals. Most plugins I put in, I put them in the vocals. Because usually they need more love, or they need a bit more of this, or a bit more of that. So, my vocals chain is a bit ridiculous. But that’s because I haven’t gotten to a point where, “Look, I don’t need this or that, nor this, nor this. It’s just this and that.” I haven’t gotten to that point with the vocals, because they’re always hard. The vocals are the only element that will never be the same twice. So I do want to be all over that. In vocals I have a main channel, vocals’ channels, one auxiliary, from that auxiliary they go to another auxiliary that is the vocals master. Because if there are backup vocals I’ve two auxiliaries from there. Then I’ve another auxiliary channel that is an expander, with a delay and a reverb, so when the voice comes in it feels bigger. Then I’ve another channel with effects. The vocals are the important element. But for the instrumental, usually it’s already good. Serko Fu OK. Over here we’ve the last one. audience member Hi, how are you? We were talking about technical things for recording, but in the final product, what would be ideal? I mean, every song has its essence, but what do you think makes up a good song? I don’t mean the structure, but what elements should it have so that it’s a well-made finished product and not something incomplete. Mastering, all that. What elements would you look for in a song to call it a song? Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Students ask me the same thing at school. And I tell them it has to have lows, mids and highs. And it has to have elements for all those areas. The best productions you listen to have lows, mids and highs. Elements. Let’s talk about a trap beat. What’s your name? What is it? Nuki? No, her. Mykka. So, a trap beat, what are its basic elements? audience member Bass. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Right, which is usually, what? audience member The hi-hat. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez The hi-hat, right, and what else? audience member And a melody. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Lows, the highs is the hi-hat, if you take the hi-hat off a trap beat it’s like, “Mmh, there’s something missing.” But it’s an element. That little thing covers the brightness. Then the melody is usually the mids. That’s your mids. The snare and the melody cover the mids. Different areas of the mids. Because the mids is the biggest area of a song. That is the low here, the highs here, and the mids in this super area here. Which you need to fill out. There go the vocals, which have their area, there goes the snare, which has its area around here, and the melody covers around there. With the right melody, the right snare, the right hi hat goes in and out at a good time, and it’s not like they’re right by each other all the time, but if it goes, you notice. There are times I listen to songs in which you can turn off an element and not notice it at all. The answer is, basically, to have exactly what you need, and nothing else. It’s OK that when you’re doing sound design, what happens? You’ve 14 tracks of synth, to make up a dubstep synth. You have like 14 tracks there, and it already sounds awesome. But all that bounces to one track. That’s an element and fills an area. Voices fill out an important area in the mids. And what goes on top, goes on top. Which usually, in electronic music, it’s “pshh,” or air, or something like that. It fills up that area. That’s what’s lost in many productions. There’s always something missing. Something with empty spaces. It’s like, “You missed this here.” And you can sit down and think about what’s missing, but if you go back to the basics, lows, mids, highs, what’s missing? You know the problem is in the mids. OK, what’s missing in the mids? Then you start taking the song apart like that. And it’s easier than trying to guess. audience member Is there a rule about levels? For when you finish a track. Frank “El Médico” Rodriguez Master levels? If it’s an electronic song, usually I take it to at least -6. There’s a way to measure in LUFS. L-U-F-S. There, in that measurement, usually an electronic song is at -6. In that measurement. A trap song or something like that, -8 or -9. A more contemporary song, like -11. Depending on the genre, obviously. The best guide there, honestly, is buying the CD of a song, not Spotify, not Apple Music, because that lowers the level. Apple Music or Spotify lowers it to like -14. -14, -16. Always. So you buy the CD that is a little less affected, and you can measure from there. You take the song and measure. There are recommended levels. But the reality is that no one uses those levels. And usually Spotify, Apple and all those like to put the songs in that level. That is, if you put it in that level and the algorithm works on it, it will probably be lower compared to the rest of the world. That’s why I compare it with another song and send it like that. But usually I live between -6 and -8. That’s where I live when I’m mastering something. And sometimes they tell me to go lower, because I go overboard. And when I lower the level is to -10, but I try to stay there. It has to average around -8, -10. In LUFS. Serko Fu OK, let’s hear it for our guy here. [applause] Thank you all for being here, I think this chat was very enlightening. See you next time, guys.

Gavin Rayna Russom
Multimedia artist and composer Gavin Rayna Russom has devoted her career to using synthesis and electronic production as a way to navigate and engage with social frameworks, academic ideas, gender and the realism of club culture. Following early involvements with rave music, DJing and the DIY underground in her native Providence, Rhode Island, Russom studied visual arts and music and began to design and build analog synthesizers, a practice that would become central to her music making. Moving to New York City in the late ’90s, she met Delia Gonzalez, a performance artist from Miami with whom she would go on to collaborate both musically and as part of the Black Leotard Front dance troupe. Russom’s work with synthesizers would eventually lead her to meet James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem and DFA Records. She helped build much of the technology used by Murphy and the band for productions and live shows, eventually joining LCD Soundsystem in the studio and on the road. She continues to record her own music solo under a variety of aliases and in collaboration, as well as creating the visual elements of her work, from record covers to installations.
In her lecture at the Red Bull Music Academy Bass Camp Calgary 2019, Russom retraced her steps from Providence’s DIY communities to today, reflecting on the importance of time, community and spirituality to her diverse artistic practice, and sharing the stories behind her solo and collaborative works.
Hosted by Aaron Gonsher Please join me in welcoming our lecturer today, she is a performer, synthesist, multi-disciplinary artist and a true unsung hero of American electronic music, Gavin Rayna Russom [applause]. I started things off with a song that we were listening to just now. It’s called “Love Song #1” and it’s under your Black Meteoric Star alias. This is an unusual song for you under that name in that it has your vocals. What can you tell us about the story behind this particular love song? Gavin Rayna Russom It’s a good story and I would be happy to share it. I did want to just do one thing before we get started, and forgive me if y’all have already done this but did y’all do any First Nations acknowledgements in the session and stuff? Aaron Gonsher There was one yesterday, but it would be great if we did another one today. Gavin Rayna Russom OK, awesome. Yeah, and I want to make sure I’m just right, that this is Niitsítpiss-stahkoli, Tsuu T’ina, Métis, Ktunaxa, and Sarsi land. Is that the same as what y’all heard yesterday? OK, awesome. I think it feels more important to just say those names and stuff so I want to make sure I’m right about that. As far as the story of this music, yeah, this record kind of has an interesting story in that Black Meteoric Star is a project that I started in 2006 and have done in various different configurations, like putting out records, playing live, performances, collaborations. In this particular case, when I wrote these things, it was because I had a friend who’s in a punk band called L’Amour Bleu in New York, a really cool band and they were doing a record release party and it was just like a house party and they were like, “Would you play?” I really wanted to do it. They’re good friends and it seemed like fun and I grew up playing in people’s houses so it seemed like a cool thing, something I hadn’t done in a while, but I didn’t want to bring a ton of gear and I wanted to do something really quick. I basically went through my studio and picked the two smallest things. I picked the smallest things I could find and tried to make some songs with them. Then I just went and did these songs at this house party. My favorite moment of that was like at some point, when I do this particular performance I usually have a costume and stuff and I actually wear sunglasses when I play so I can’t see anything at all. You know, at somebody’s house and at some point I accidentally stepped on the power strip that was powering just the PA, not the equipment. It was one of the performance moments where suddenly I was like, “Oh, that’s what happened,” and I kept a count in my head, which I think is just from DJing, and turned the power right back on, on the one. So suddenly everything dropped down and came back in and nobody realized what happened, because the whole PA had turned off and back on again. I had no idea what I would do with that material, it was just kind of for this thing, but I really liked it, so I was like I’m going to make a record. It was also a thing, I think it started even with The Xecond Xoming of Black Meteoric Star, which is kind of the double album that I did before this, that when I would do this project live I would do a lot of vocalizing. There’s kind of like an improvisational way and I would sometimes sing over songs that had been released on records as instrumentals, and sometimes I would sing, there was one time I sang the lyrics of [Stevie Nicks’] “Edge of Seventeen” over “Dreamcatcher.” Just trying different things, but that had never really made it onto records, like the last song on The Xecond Xoming has vocals on it. This was also a thing too of trying to capture a bit more of the sound of what a Black Meteoric Star live thing is like. Aaron Gonsher I think this record in particular, and one of the reasons I wanted to play it all the way through, is whether under Black Meteoric Star or not, it represents a lot of what I associate with your solo productions and electronic music, of things that are very hypnotic and propulsive, but also have very unique timbral worlds. I was curious if you could share what your earliest entrée into these sounds were when you were growing up in Rhode Island and how you sort of came to this type of electronic music. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, well, I think from a bunch of different angles. Just in terms of sort of beat-driven electronic music that sat in the 117 to like, 127 BPM world. It was kind of around in a lot of forms so… Aaron Gonsher Even in Providence? Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, I mean Providence… Aaron Gonsher What year would this have been that you… Gavin Rayna Russom In 1988 maybe, 1987. I mean I think probably I started having those experiences of hungering for music that wasn’t easily available when I was kind of like 12 or 13. Even earlier. I just was that kind of person. I was always just kind of like… I mean maybe it’s just being contrary, or maybe it’s kind of like an eagerness, but I remember when all the kids were listening to Rick Springfield, I was listening to oldies radio because I was just hungry for something that was, just came from a different place or something. Aaron Gonsher Was there something about your family or the community that you were growing up in that you felt encouraged that sense of contrariness or discovery? Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, probably. I mean I would say my family, I think we’re sort of outsiders on multiple levels; and that, like, my dad was not just an academic but an academic of some very, very obscure stuff. And my mom grew up overseas and worked with technology and stuff so it was just kind of like, I never had that feeling of sort of being in the fold of what other people were doing. And also musically, they were just into kind of cool stuff. I was just into sound from when I was a little kid. When I was even a little tiny kid, I was begging my parents to buy me bagpipe records because I got super into bagpipes, because it was something just compelling about that sound, which wasn’t just a sound; it connected with me with the whole idea of Scottish mythology. I had one of those little plastic organs that a lot of kids do, and my favorite thing would be… like, it has the keys and then the chord buttons and [I’d] just hold all the chord buttons down together for as long as my hand would take it. Aaron Gonsher The love of drone came in early. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, early. Yeah, it went like womb, drone, now. As far as the first time I heard, let’s say, some of the dancefloor-oriented electronic music coming out of the Midwest and stuff, was on late-night radio in Providence, and Providence was a very cool place. And I think partly because it was such a small city, it had this effect of all kinds of cultures like really bumping up [against] each other. In a way, actually – I’ve lived in New York for a long time – it’s actually much more than what you experience in New York. It was really wild how there’s just all this overlapping all the time, and not even overlapping, just everybody kind of jammed in together. I think, so that mix of kind of urban life with art school life, and there being a college there, it just created a really cool environment and so there were lots of great late night radio stations; and I mean, I’m not sure this was the moment, but I definitely… like, there was some moment where I was 14 and in the back of somebody’s van, and it was way later than I should have been out, and the radio was on, and just being like, “What is this? What is this music?” And hearing a pretty wide array of things, like some things that were coming from the Midwest, some things that were coming from Europe, some things that were more on the industrial side, but hearing music that was made by machines and just being like, “What is this?” The thing that most grabbed me was acid house and just being like, “I’ve got to get involved in this.” It was also in a very… I was 14, [so] it was also in a very childish kind of way too of not really knowing where it was coming from, and what it was, or how it was made, but just being like, “Whatever this is, I want to know more about it.” Aaron Gonsher How does a 14 year old in Providence go about making acid house? Gavin Rayna Russom Well, I went over to my cousin’s house who lived a block away and we were about the same age, and his dad was a computer programmer. So I think he had a bit more of a relationship to technology, and him and his older sister were both classical musicians. They took music lessons and stuff, which I did too but I didn’t have the… like, OK, his dad was a computer programmer and his mom was a piano teacher, so that kind of made this sort of, there was a better environment for music and technology over there. My house was more like, I don’t know, talking. Even when we were kids, he had some gear. He had an Alesis HR-16 drum machine, and he had a four-track. We both had reel-to-reels, which was a big thing because our parents had them from the ’70s. He also had a Siel synth I think. He had some gear, and then he also had this friend who I think maybe had a bit more money, who had this little electronic music studio in his basement, like built around a Commodore 64 and four-track and stuff. Aaron Gonsher Do you remember the first acid house record you actually had? Gavin Rayna Russom No. That I had? Aaron Gonsher Yeah, that you bought as opposed to you hearing on the radio. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, the first record that I had was this compilation called House Hallucinates, that’s like a British compilation of stuff from Chicago. The track that I really remember from that; I mean I had it on a cassette but I bought it on vinyl like 15 years ago. But the track that I really remember from that time was Lidell Townsell “As Acid Turns,” mostly because like the vocal is just like… I was like, “What world, where is the world where this is what is happening?” Because he’s just going like, “Flail.” It’s a beat and it’s not even a 303. That track, it’s like a strange synth pattern and he’s like, I think the lyrics to that are, “Flail. Lidell.” I was just like, “Where is the world where you go and that’s what’s happening? I want to go to that world and I want to be in that world.” We started our acid house crew that was called the Acid Barons and we made T-shirts… Aaron Gonsher Good name. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, thanks – by like cutting out manila folders that our parents had around for files, like making stencils and spray painting Acid Barons T-shirts… Aaron Gonsher Do you still have any of those shirts? Gavin Rayna Russom I wish, I wish. We made a tape. There was a tape. I don’t know, I don’t have… Aaron Gonsher Probably going for like $1,000 on Discogs somewhere. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, because what it was, was like we would take a boombox that had the two decks where you can record the one deck on the other deck, do you know what I’m talking about? Aaron Gonsher Sort of. Gavin Rayna Russom It was a very popular thing where you have a radio and two cassette decks and one deck only plays and the other deck records, and you can record what’s on the first deck to the second deck if you want to copy a tape. I kind of figured out this technique that you can make a loop by putting record and pause on the second deck and then playing the first one right before the loop you want, un-pausing when the loop comes, and then pausing it again, and then doing that over and over again. Aaron Gonsher Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah. We’d take like a Kraftwerk record or like a Tangerine Dream record and just do that for four minutes and then try to get a drum machine to sync up sometimes but it didn’t work that well and then we’d go take the phone off the hook, like the landline off the hook in one part of the house and then put a mic on it in the other part of the house and talking to the phone so that it sounded like technological, or it sounded like a sample. We were trying to make it sound like a sample. [laughs] Aaron Gonsher Well, before we talk about Bard, let’s talk about Under the Hut. Gavin Rayna Russom Yes, I think it’s so important. Aaron Gonsher It connects to the skaters that you were just talking about as well. Gavin Rayna Russom Totally. Yeah, so, well the Skate Hut was this place that I don’t actually know too much about. It must’ve been a legal venue because it had huge skate ramps in it. I can’t imagine that they… although in Providence at that time, it wouldn’t have been inconceivable that somebody would’ve just built a bunch of skate ramps in an abandoned building and nobody cared. I mean it was in Olneyville, which I think became quite popular in the 2000s when kind of the Load Records scene started to really get some attention in Providence. And Olneyville, it’s a neighborhood in Providence where there was a lot of industrial production in the late 1800s, a lot of big mill buildings and stuff. Then like so many American cities, the economy just collapsed and there were a lot of just abandoned buildings, and a lot of crime, and a lot of mob activity, a lot of super corrupt police activity and stuff. So in the ’80s, Olneyville was like a real open area. It was a place that had not been monetized in any way so nobody was paying attention to it. It was a place where probably police went to go do illegal things. There was no police presence or like a gentrification type, carceral model. I mean there was a place where cops went to get hot dogs and stuff; but it was a place that nobody was watching. It is possible that maybe that it was even illegal, but it must’ve been, I think to some degree a legal venue. But it was like an indoor skate park, kind of, with these big skate ramps and definitely always music playing. I think they did sometimes have bands play their stuff too. It also just became like a hang out. I think by that time I wasn’t even really skating anymore and it was also super intimidating. There was no way. There was some pro skater that owned it I think, that owned it or ran it or whatever and it was very intimidating for me if I was going to try to go skate there. But it became this cool hang out of… like, just again, in that sort of drift from, “What are we going to do? Oh, cool, let’s go to the Skate Hut.” Just a place. I think I could drink there probably. Again, nobody was watching. It hadn’t been monetized and nobody was watching, which was cool for me as a teenager because I could do a lot of things that older people were doing and I couldn’t go to clubs because they still carded at clubs. Aaron Gonsher Like it was sort of a club, not a club, but there was something that was a part of the Skate Hut. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, it was like a scene. It was open late at night, and there were always people there, and it was like one of those things where if you went there with two people, you’d meet ten more and hang out. It was in an industrial building in Olneyville and at some point – I wish I could remember who it was, I can’t – but somebody figured out that there was this basement and it was empty, and nobody was doing anything with it. And whoever owned the Skate Hut was leasing the building so they were just like, “Let’s start a club in the basement.” I know there was a person who was in charge, sort of, or a group of people, and I can’t remember who they were. But it did seem like it kind of naturally grew out of just the scene of people that were hanging out there and became, I think, kind of collectively run. And while I certainly wouldn’t say I was actually part of running it, I felt like I was involved with that. I watched it happen. I knew it, and my band played there. My punk band played there and opened for cool bands from out of town. I remember the first show there, there were all these rocks, because they had been doing construction in the building, so it was just like these piles of rocks. It was, like, people just sitting on piles of rocks watching punk bands play. It really became a thing. It very quickly took off and at least every weekend if not more, there were punk shows there and I could go. Nobody carded me. There was no security. That was really compelling to feel a part of that. I think it was sort of around the same time that the ABC No Rio scene was happening in New York, so a lot of those bands were coming and also bringing that energy of activism. And a lot of anarchists; a lot of radical politics; and a lot of thinking about the punk scene in a context of radical politics, like not just as music, not just as a fun way to get all your aggressions out, but a genuine testing ground for new social models, and a place where we could talk about things. Aaron Gonsher That felt like an ethos that has really stuck with you since? Gavin Rayna Russom Definitely. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I mean that became my context in a lot of ways, is this idea that music is part of a social whole, in which people are able to connect in meaningful ways and develop new ideas about how to live. That happened while simultaneously that experience was happening, I was also sort of – it’s one of those things where I don’t really know. I was a teenager. I was failing out of school. I was cutting school all the time. I was doing drugs. I was hanging out with like super shady people. I was getting bullied – not bullied – I was getting jumped and beaten up a lot. I was around a ton of violence. I’m not sure how it happened but basically, there was a decision between myself and my parents that I was going to go to this art school where my cousin had actually gone. Because I had taken cello lessons as a kid and studied classical music, but I’d never been that good at it to be honest, and it had never grabbed me. Visual arts became the thing that I was going to go study there, and I was accepted and it’s just an interesting thing. It’s like simultaneously while I was having this pretty profound experience of getting into the Providence scene and experiencing the depths of it, I was also sort of preparing to leave. This was before college, this was like the last two years of high school. I moved out of Providence in 1990 when I was 16. I think that has a lot to do with kind of what you were starting to ask, of like how did it shift from being hanging out, listening to late night radio, going to punk clubs, hang out on the street to thinking seriously about music and composition and art in an academic way. Aaron Gonsher What was that like, sort of combining those environments? Gavin Rayna Russom Pretty, like, kind of a head fuck that I’m still unraveling. I mean, it’s kind of now become… I think my life’s work is to try to, at least for myself, but I think also in the world, negotiate those dynamics in meaningful ways. Because it’s not about intelligence. A lot of it is class, I think. It’s not like people in academia are really smart and street kids are really dumb. In my experience, in a lot of ways, honestly quite often, it was the opposite. A lot of kids that I grew up with, some of whom were sex workers and stuff, some of them were in and out of mental institutions, you know, were very deep thinkers, and really had powerful, meaningful ideas about creativity and about the world. My dad’s an academic. It’s not like I discovered academia when I went to college. I was certainly aware of it. I also found people talked a lot of shit. My educational experience was one of tremendous frustration. I mean, the arts were obviously exciting and dynamic. Having the experience of studying painting without any real formal background, studying musical composition without any real formal background, coming into the level where I was so insistent on my own aesthetic concerns, and also was old enough, too. A little too old to be shaped, but then having people who were like, “Oh wow. Like, you’re not really doing what we’re trying to do here, but you’re obviously not going to do that, so let’s talk and figure it out.” It was like, I was into graffiti and stuff, so I was like, “Can I paint like I’m doing graffiti?” I mean, it’s cool. Teachers are cool. I got exposed to abstract expressionism. They were like, “Well, this seems like kind of something you might be into. It’s messy, and it’s kind of punk.” It was a lot of navigating those dynamics, but also feeling like that experience of sort of being involved in some kind of counterculture, or whatever, actually having power, I think to some degree, it was almost this illusion created by how small Providence was. That we could actually have this club, and be talking about political stuff, and making things happen, and feel like it was so big, because compared to the size of the city, it was big. So, it was a lot of things. That’s such an interesting thing. That’s still stuff that I’m unpacking. What it kind of crystallized around was that I began to be exposed to what I found to be really interesting ideas, particularly radical ideas about structure, and how through the creative arts, it was possible to reimagine structures. Reimagine musical and creative structures, but then by extension of that, to reimagine political structures and social structures. By diving deeply into, not just the creative arts, but the theory around the creative arts, one could start to shape really radical models of how society could change, and how human beings could interact with each other, and all of that stuff. That kind of bumping into this thing that felt so important about like, “Yes, but this has to be a real thing. This can’t just be like some people in a room talking about this. It has to actually penetrate into people’s actual lives. How does it do that?” One of the ways, for me, was by connecting it with spirituality. Feeling like there’s some way in which art is spiritual, and spirituality is radical, and that kind of created this constellation of meaning for me. It was an intense thing. My period of doing academic study, it was not easy. It was really fraught. Aaron Gonsher How did that academic study and this increasing reflection on spirituality manifest in the music that you were making at that time, and that you were starting to make as you moved out of Bard towards New York City? You moved to New York City in the ’90s? Gavin Rayna Russom January of ’97. Aaron Gonsher How was this manifesting in the music that you were making at that time? Gavin Rayna Russom Mostly, I think at Bard it manifested in me really slowing down. Really starting to make very long compositions in which not that much would happen. Starting to move from an idea of improvising to an idea of composing in time, which is a really subtle difference. Aaron Gonsher Can you describe the differences? Gavin Rayna Russom For me, the main difference was in the depth of listening. I think of improvising as a very expressive act. For me, shifting that to an idea of composing in time meant that it was much more expressive/reflective at the same time. I might sit at a piano for, let’s say, 45 minutes, and play maybe that amount of notes, and start to notice things that, when I approached things from this idea of composing in time, that I would have... Like, for me, improvisation is maybe a bit exploratory. I love improvisation, and it’s not a super important distinction, but for me, just at the time, it was an important shift, just in my own story. I don’t think either of these things is definitions. It was just in how I thought about it. Like, certain things where I would be just sort of composing in time, and developing a kind of structure of sound, and then have this impetus like, “Let me try something that feels really outside of this,” and try and note the change completely. Like, it would break that pattern. It was a cool thing, pretty psychedelic thing of realizing, “If I create this pattern by the notes and structures that I choose, and then I break this pattern by the notes and structures that I choose, I can then, actually create a bigger structure and pattern by what comes later.” I think that was the kind of distinction of this thing of starting to build musical structures in time that became kind of my practice at Bard. And doing that also, not just with music, but also doing that in space, with visual objects. The thing that I got really excited about was creating environments and creating music to put in those environments. But then, actually, my composition program collapsed a semester before… I had this amazing, I would say, kind of a people experience where I went back to Providence for a summer. I started going to a ton of the newer underground illegal clubs that were there, which were kind of focused around a like, much more connected to RISD [Rhode Island School of Design] and the art school, and where there was this very punk stuff happening, but it was also very performative. Bands would always have costumes, and it was very much connected with the noise scene. So it was this cool thing where I just went back, and because I was from there, just dropped straight into this scene that was happening, that was like, “Oh, shit. People are doing experimental music in clubs, and it’s kind of punk, and people are dancing.” That was super exciting to me, and then I went back a little bit like, “How is this all going to work?” I mean, I was also playing in bands at Bard. So, it was like these things all came together, and then suddenly the composition program that I had been in no longer existed. They just removed it from the course curriculum, and put the professor on permanent sabbatical, I think. It was this thing right before I left college, everything kind of fell apart, and I was also getting this new influx of stuff. I was already going to New York a lot. It was just kind of like, ramping up, and I moved to New York really on a whim and a chance. One of the women in the art faculty at Bard, who wasn’t even my teacher, was always like, “Come and hang out in my studio.” And she was like, “You should move to New York.” And I was like, “OK.” She was like, “My friend is subletting her apartment. Take it. Go, move to New York.” So, leading up to that, it was like, suddenly all, like I had gone to this place, so for me, my whole relationship with music was so quiet, and so introspective, and reflective, and slow. That was really good. It was really good for me to clean house, and have this really open thing. And then, suddenly, all of this stuff started coming. Aaron Gonsher Can I play some music that you were making at that time in New York? Gavin Rayna Russom Totally. Aaron Gonsher And then you can talk about some of these influences. Gavin Rayna Russom Yes, that sounds great. Aaron Gonsher This is a project of yours called Paper Eyes, that was recently reissued, then it’s a song called, “Synthesis Energy.” Gavin Rayna Russom That’s a good one. (music: Paper Eyes – “Synthesis Energy” / applause) Aaron Gonsher So, that was Paper Eyes, “Synthesis Energy,” and the reason why I wanted to play that is because, in it, I feel like I hear so many different elements of the music that I assume you might have been listening to at this time in New York. It’s sort of funky, but there’s the noise influence that you were just mentioning. It sounds like something, dance music that someone would be playing at a noise event. Can you just talk a little bit about your time in New York in that era? It’s obviously been spoken about a lot, but I think your perspective is really valuable in reframing what it was actually like to be a working musician in the city at that time. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, totally. And too, I just remembered, I wanted to read this quote from the person who I studied composition with at Bard, because I think it’s a good lead in of where I was coming from to where I was going. Aaron Gonsher What’s their name? Gavin Rayna Russom Benjamin Boretz. I would say this is a pretty typical indicator of the stuff we talked about every day in six- to eight-hour classes. “Do I have to tell you about the spiritual cannibalism of the culture, our culture, which has been bombarding us with ultra-sensory, overstimulation, aiming to reprocess us into full-time consumption machines. Stealing, above all, from us, our time. Not an inch of time without an imprint of message. And even our sense of time, to be measured in length of no more than one message unit each, under the guise of entertainment, and even of art, commoditizing the eternal, hyping the primal. Our time is the sine qua non of our identity. We need to take extreme measures to reclaim it for ourselves and each other.” Which is super radical, and it’s still really is like, very resonant for me, that statement. Aaron Gonsher It’s only gotten worse since he wrote that. Gavin Rayna Russom He wrote that in the ’80s. It’s pretty, also, foreshadowing. That meant a lot to me. To have that idea, even that specific thing, of like, the way in which our time is stolen from us, and the way in which music provides this opportunity, particularly music – any kind of creative structuring, but especially music – provides this opportunity to reclaim one’s time, and that is this very radical, actually inherently political thing. Like, “If you are making music, you are working with time.” Is that time your time? Or is that time somebody else’s time? But it’s a very deep idea. It’s also a lot for a kid. I was in my early 20s, so that’s what I was coming from, and what I was going towards was New York, where that’s what goes on. Where everything is, in a sense, in the marketplace. That was this kind of mindset of absorbing all these new things, hearing all this music and hearing it because it was around me. Aaron Gonsher Did this sense of wanting to reclaim the time, and what you were contributing to the time the people were spending, is that in any way connected to when you started to build your own synthesizers, and sort of make a decision that, not only were you going to make music, but you were going to make music on the terms of the things that you were constructing on your own? Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah. I think it was something that I didn’t even realize was anomalous at the time, and maybe wasn’t as anomalous at that time. Also, I think a lot of people were maybe also creating the means of the production of their music, too. Because I was coming from this idea of like, that to make... Let’s see. Let me think. So, I think one of the most important insights that I got from studying music at an academic level was this idea that there is no default of how music goes. There is no baseline of what music is, and I think mostly, that traces back to this woman, Susan McClary, who’s like a theorist and musicologist. There are always social and political agendas embedded into every choice that manifests itself as music. And I think, then, what my professor had added to that was, as a composer, one should then try as much as possible to start from scratch, because the degree to which one picks up where somebody else left off, is the degree to which you’re implicitly endorsing that agenda. For example, it’s very easy to study from the Eurocentric Western classical tradition. Picking up that tradition means also picking up the politics of that time, and the class dynamics of that time, and picking, like, slavery, and picking up colonialism. Picking all that stuff up while you say, “Oh, well yeah. No, it’s just like, you know, I just like the way that stuff sounds.” But there is no “just the way that stuff sounds.” At least that’s the idea that was very meaningful to me. To some degree, I felt like it was necessary to do as much starting from scratch as I could, and that meant not just creating music, but also creating the methodology of the music that I was making. For example, with those Paper Eyes things, with those tracks, I didn’t just make that music, but I created all of the techniques by which I made that music. Like, yes, I had a cassette deck, and I had a reel-to-reel, and obviously those are pieces of technology that exist for recording, but the way that music was made, was something that I developed by taking pieces of gear and using them in unconventional ways, by using recording techniques that developed because I wanted to create certain sounds, or because it was just necessity. Like, “Oh, I want to make a multi-track recording, but I don’t have a multi-track recorder, so I’ll just play the old recording back into the room and record it while I’m playing the new thing live.” A lot of it was just what was available, but without even realizing what I was doing, it became critical to my creative practice to not just make music, but also make the means by which I was making music. I couldn’t get my hands on a synthesizer in any easy way. The easiest way was to learn electronics engineering and learn how to build one, because I just had this feeling that it looked like a tool that would help me make the kind of sounds that I felt like was the kind of sound I wanted to make, and that sounded like, that it felt meaningful. And then also, to bring it back to where, I think maybe, we started, I was going to a lot of different kinds of clubs, and hearing a lot of different kinds of music for dancing. That was also part of that constellation of, “Well, what’s meaningful to me? What do I think is important? What is the kind of culture I want to live in? What is the kind of world that I want to live in? How does the music I make reflect that?” And there was something about that physicality of the way that, when you’re in a space with other people, especially if that space was a marginal space of some kind, when there is music, especially music of a certain kind, these kinds of social interactions are possible that wouldn’t be possible in other circumstances. That made me also want to make music that somebody could dance to, and want to bring this sort of like, kind of wide abstract, compositional idea into music that would also operate on a physical level, and that you could dance to. A lot of what was happening for me in New York was like, going to all these different places. Going to some places that were more like... And like, I wasn’t alone in that. There were rave type events where that was kind of what was happening. Again, it was something I more observed than participated in, I would say. I was going to all these places and soaking up all these different kinds of things, and being in places where it was not clearly defined what kind of thing it was. Like we were talking earlier about my suddenly discovering like, “Oh, right.” Like in 2015 like, “Oh, this is like a techno place. So, everybody that DJs here plays techno, and everybody that comes here wants to hear techno.” And that’s like, so foreign to me, that idea, because what was so meaningful to me about nightlife spaces was that lack of definition, and that lack of transparency about what was actually happening; and more of like, an ambiguous, opaque experience of people interacting and exploring things. Aaron Gonsher You were also, at the time in New York though, sort of falling in with a label. A particular label, or collective of people. But the music that you first put out on that label, DFA, was very different from everything that they had released at that time, or by that time. And I’m talking about The Days of Mars record in particular. I want to play something from that, but because I need to get the record out, I was hoping you could tell everyone a little bit about who Delia Gonzalez is, first of all, and how it felt to sort of be a part of this group, but simultaneously, not a part of this group, despite the fact that you have become very associated with them in that period of time. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah. One of the many scenes that I was kind of hanging out in New York in the mid-’90s, was this kind of like, I think a bunch of art school kids from different cities that had kind of all moved to New York. It’s sort of the beginnings of gentrification, to be honest, which now I feel like a lot of the work that I do around gentrification is because I definitely know that I contributed to it at this time in my life, as well. And it was the beginning of Williamsburg becoming a place for artists to hang out before it became what it is now. There were just lots of like… I don’t know, it was very punk, but also way more fun. Not super aggro-like, punk, and one of the people that I connected with in that scene was this woman, Delia Gonzalez, who is from Miami. She was doing work that I just thought was really cool. It was just this fun kind of party scene of doing parties in illegal venues. People would put on plays and puppet shows, and dance performances. Delia was in a dance company, and then later, [Black] Leotard Front, this dance company that we had together, kind of grew out of that. So, we kind of met each other, and hit it off, in that sort of ambiguous way. Got together, and started making work together, which initially was kind of growing out of this scene. At that time also, the art world was kind of discovering that scene, so there was a little bit of an interesting overlap between the art world and this more punk thing. Aaron Gonsher Can we just be specific, when you’re saying, “that scene,” who were some of these people? What were some of the labels that we’re talking about? Gavin Rayna Russom There was no nothing. I mean, the thing that came out of that scene was Fischerspooner. The thing that actually, I think, went somewhere was Fischerspooner. As far as I could tell, it’s the only thing. One of the many things I was doing at the time, I was in this band called Sweet Thunder, with this woman, Kelly Kuvo, who had been in this band called the Scissor Girls, from Chicago, that was a super, super important, influential band for me. So, I was kind of geeked out that I got to play in a band with her. And then she brought in all these other people she knew from Chicago, one of whom was Casey Spooner, and I think it was his kind of introduction to doing music and that grew into Fischerspooner. Lizzie, who was on the early Fischerspooner records, was also in that band. Then we just sort of started just venturing out to try to make it in New York City as artists and doing a lot of different things; and one of the things that we started doing was making electronic music together with the synths that I had built. And I was like… classic New York broke artist. I didn’t have... I was like, “What am I going to do?” And I got this job, like the whole long story of that, I’m happy to tell if you want, but I’ve told it many times, of how I got hired at DFA. Aaron Gonsher Long story short, you emailed a bunch of labels saying that you could fix synths and James Murphy was the only one that responded. Gavin Rayna Russom The only one that wrote back, like three minutes after I sent out the email too. Aaron Gonsher He must’ve had a lot of broke synths. Gavin Rayna Russom And he was like, “We have all these synths that we bought on eBay and none of them work. Please, please, please come and fix all our stuff.” So DFA was my job. I got hired to be like the studio tech at DFA. Also a lot of that was building stuff where they would be like... The first thing I ever got hired at DFA to do was, James was like... It was 2002, I think. He was like, “I made this track and it kind of seems like it’s catching on and I didn’t ever intend to actually play live with this project, but it looks like we’re gonna have to play this song live and I don’t know how to do it because it just was made by this crappy old Casio boombox. Could you build kind of like a super Casio that’s super tough and I could take on tour and everything?” That was “Losing My Edge,” which at the time was a song that he thought was catching on a little bit, which then became… Aaron Gonsher I think it caught on. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, I think it caught on. But just to place it in time and space, that was the kind of thing that I was doing. Or they would have... A lot of times, it was just, “We have this synth, can you do something cool with it?” And I’d build a mod into it or something. A lot of it had to do with the stuff that I was interested in at the time, which was trying to get ambient sounds to sync to rhythmic sounds in an interesting way and using analog synthesis to do that. And that was really up their alley. I think especially a lot of the remixes you can hear technology that I built, the DFA remixes time. So that was my job and at some point, James was on our… and Tim and Jon, who was at that time, the label was James Murphy, Tim Goldsworthy and [Jonathan] Galkin. It was just these three dudes running this label. And Jon and Tim came to a screening that Delia and I were doing and we played a live soundtrack and at the time, it seemed like they were like, “This is cool.” And they were like, “Do you want to put out a record?” That journey that I described... I was coming from way out there. I did not know what DFA was. I didn’t know what the scene was. There were a lot of things about New York that I did not know. I was coming from a very, very outside place because after having this time, I basically hung out with this one person, like me and Delia hung out and sometimes did dance performances with this other guy. But I was just coming from a very different world, like a world of reading books and doing witchcraft in my house and building synthesizers in my sink. So it was this thing. It was like, oh, these people have a label and it seems kind of cool and they want to put a record out. Later, I understood that it was part of building that story of that label, to be able to say, “And we even have this,” and that was the role that I played as an artist on the label is, “We even have this out-there, psychedelic electronic music.” And that’s where I was used to build this more known DFA aesthetic of the punk-funk and... What is it that James called it? And synthesizer bass and real drums or something like... There was a very strong aesthetic of what DFA sounded like and this was very different. But it was sort of used to build that story, to set DFA even further apart from the other labels at that time. So that was kind of what it was like. It was like I’d show up for work and then sometimes James would be on tour and we’d get to work in the studio. Sometimes Britney Spears or Duran Duran would show up at the studio, ’cause DFA was a cool hot label. Aaron Gonsher Britney Spears? Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah. Aaron Gonsher There was a point where he was maybe going to produce a record for her. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, she was there. She spent two days at the studio. I actually have this notebook where she was brainstorming lyrics and she took my tech notebook and did it, brainstormed all her lyrics on my legal pad tech notebook, which I still have. Aaron Gonsher Let’s listen to Days of Mars, because I think there’s other production questions that it’s going to bring up afterwards. This is “Relevee” from Delia Gonzalez and Gavin Russom, The Days of Mars. (music: Delia Gonzalez and Gavin Russom – “Rise” / applause) Gavin Rayna Russom I think it’s worth mentioning too, that’s what? 14 minutes long? Aaron Gonsher No, it’s almost like 17 minutes long I think. If we had a full hour just to play this album, I really would. That was “Rise.” I think there’s an interesting point to make about this album that the song we were originally going to play, “Relevee” is also like a 13-minute, 14-minute kosmiche track that then took on this entirely new second life when Carl Craig remixed it and it became a very, very popular dancefloor track. Gavin Rayna Russom It’s on a Sven Väth compilation CD and they played it at Love Parade the year it came out. So just... [laughs] Aaron Gonsher I think the interesting thing to me about tracking that relationship is seeing how this was an album that you’ve mentioned DFA was using as, “We don’t just do this sort of punky dance thing, we’re doing this serious, out-there music,” then it then crossed the boundary into becoming a fun club thing. I’m curious to hear your take in general about how you think your music nowadays is traversing this more serious/fun boundary and in general how you can, as a musician, transcend that sort of “or” thinking and make it be more about “and” thinking. Like it can be fun and serious and not fun or serious. I just thought this would be an interesting jumping-off point to talk about that. Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, absolutely. For sure. That dynamic was certainly in play, even at this time. When this came out, I didn’t realize it at the time how radical it was, in a way, to have this thing of it’s a two LP, double LP, with four songs on it and each one of them is around 15 minutes long and it came out on a label that, at that time, was pretty much famous for “House of Jealous Lovers” by the Rapture and “Losing My Edge” by LCD Soundsystem. So it was really like, “What?” But for me, I was kind of operating in this world where I had already been like, “Yeah I’m super serious about music and I also really like going to clubs.” And I think partly because Tim Goldsworthy, who really worked a lot on this record, I recently found the demo tapes of this record and it’s wild to hear just the difference from what me and Delia’s demos were like versus what happened, which I think had a lot to do with Tim. But he was British and he was from that scene, so we kind of talked about acid house a lot and so it was in the process of working on this record too that I kind of remembered and reawakened my teenage interest and love of that music and started getting some records that I didn’t have and pretty much also, when I DJed, I just started playing acid house all the time. And at that time, also, I think because of our interest in dance, Delia and also Chris and some visual artists that we hang out with, we’re going to Harlem and we were going to vogue balls. That’s still the best. I don’t know. It’s so complex the way that that culture has been appropriated in the last, I don’t know, ten years. So it makes me reluctant to talk about it, for me as a queer kid who was trying to figure myself out, as somebody who values deep and complex art, but also deep and complex art that actually connects with daily lives, it was a very powerful thing for me to spend time as a guest in that scene at a time when it was between Madonna co-opting vogue and the current wave of that now, so it was also, nobody was watching and it was really interesting. So I think there’s, yeah, the idea of serious and fun. For me, I would say one of the things that I’ve dedicated my life to is trying to find ways of living outside of all kinds of binaries. And that’s one of them that I’ve been working on for a long time and to dichotomize that has not been super significant to me, to think of those as polar opposites. Like oh, there’s serious music and there’s fun music. That didn’t work out so well for me. So I’ve really worked to find different ways of thinking about it and even the idea of listening to music and dance music is a little bit weird to me, because I’m always doing both of those things when I’m engaged in music. But I think the thing that became more and more important to me and now I think has become the thing is this way in which an environment, like a club in which dancing is sort of the default ritual behavior, let’s hope, on a good night, not just like a bunch of terrible dudes trying to make girls feel uncomfortable, provides this opportunity to engage with music in a way that shifts it away from the commodities market and more towards something that is physically experienced; and because it’s experienced physically, it enters the whole cognitive apparatus of the human organism in a different way. And what’s, for me, I think a little bit of a more significant way. Like if I just have a relationship with music that’s my ears and my brain, I’m losing so much of the spectrum of what it can be. No matter what kind of music it is. So that even this record, which I think... I had hoped at the time that it would be part of the asset of releasing it on a dance level, I think maybe became part of the liability of releasing it on a dance label. I thought of this also as dance music. This is music that speaks to the body and I think because it emerged in a context which was very drum, beat-driven and it’s not drum, beat-driven. None of the tracks have beats on this record, if you don’t know it. It came across as, oh, this is Eno, like Tangerine Dream, this is ambient music where[as] I thought of this as really physical. I think that in fact set it very broadly apart from things like Eno or Tangerine Dream stuff. Also it was feminist music, very intentionally, and coming from a really different place than this, what I think of as a male dominated history of electronic music. Aaron Gonsher What’s your definition of feminist music? Gavin Rayna Russom I think that feminism is too broad to be defined, but when I have to, I always go back to a quote from Angela Davis in a lecture that she gave called Abolition in Feminism, where she talks about feminism as the ability to make connections between things which don’t in patriarchal culture seem connected and discover that things which are assumed to be connected in a patriarchal culture are not actually connected. That’s as good as I can do on the definition and it’s not mine. It’s somebody who’s done a lot more of that work than me. Aaron Gonsher So this sense of categorization of music, is that something that, as a producer and as a composer, what techniques do you do to actively work against that impending categorization just in the process of composition? It’s very... The motivation is to put the name on these things all the time, but I assume you have some sort of strategies, whether it’s philosophical or even technical that you’ve accumulated over the years that you would hope pre-empt this in some way? Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah, just being unrelentingly complex and authentic I think is the best one, which is not easy at all. I think that’s also where that spiritual thing comes in too. The market is extremely alluring and the market in its current state thrives on categorization. That’s sort of, that’s how it works. Categorization is, in large part, something that comes out of Enlightenment-era European thought and... Colonialism, slavery, those things emerge from that worldview. So I did actually make a track that’s called “Hostile To Categorization” and that is my position on it, mostly for those reasons. And I do think that complexity tends to be the thing that consistently upturns, like, categorization. I do think liberation really lies in acknowledging the complexity of the human experience at every point. That’s the sort of philosophical approach. I try to make music that comes from a place of an authentic acknowledgement of human complexity, mainly my own because that’s the one that I’m most familiar with. But it’s definitely fed into the ways I’ve collaborated with people in certain ways and the ways that I’ve chosen to disseminate my music and that stuff. But also it’s deep in the production. It’s very deep in the production. Again, coming from that place of not just producing music, but developing the methodology of production is really about how to create sonic work that doesn’t immediately tick off these buttons of, “Oh yeah, that’s what that is.” Aaron Gonsher You’re practicing all of these technical and conceptual philosophies in your solo work and with your collaborations with people like Delia Gonzalez or with Viva Ruiz and the Crystal Ark. But at the same time, you’re also a member of frankly, one of the biggest bands in the world and you’re put in a position as a member of LCD Soundsystem where you’re going on stage every night, and you’re playing something that people have come to expect, that have this sort of sense of familiarity that they want to have. They have a relationship with these songs and specific elements of them. I’d be curious to hear more generally what it’s like being in this experience of going from working with a guy who didn’t think that his Casio drum machine track was going to take off, to backing him on massive world tours, huge festival stages, and how that impacts your own solo creativity as well. Take us into this experience, because I’m sure it’s a little bit of a mind fuck. Gavin Rayna Russom It’s complicated. And it’s my job. I don’t mean that in kind of a dismissive way of it’s not really my thing, it’s like my job. Because it’s much more complicated than that. It’s a job that I... The job working for James, building the super Casio or modifying the synth in 2002 is still the same job, more or less, of me going on stage and performing the synthesizer parts of LCD Soundsystem songs night after night on world tours. It’s more or less been a fluid thing that’s just grown. Even in the very beginning, James would say, “Oh, we really want to play “Beat Connection” live, and there’s that crazy synth part at the beginning. I know you’d be the perfect person to do it. Could we work that out?” And it was mostly the financial limitations of the band that meant that wasn’t possible. Not that hiring me was going to break the bank, but there was a certain amount of gear, there was a certain amount of logistics to do that and it just never worked until James was getting ready to make This is Happening. I think there was enough support behind that, that he felt like he could do this thing, which I think was something he had always wanted to do, which was hire me to actually play in the band. Aaron Gonsher You also have songwriting credits on This is Happening, right? Gavin Rayna Russom I do. But in these totally weird ways. I have songwriting credit on “Drunk Girls,” which of the songs on that record, I think anybody would be like, “What is...” I have a songwriting credit on “Drunk Girls” and “One Touch.” The “One Touch” is a vocal. I do backing vocals on that. “Drunk Girls,” that song, really different than I think almost any LCD Soundsystem song, came out of some musicians actually jamming in a room. Most of LCD is James by himself creating those songs and the back... It’s like it’s him making that. And I think “Drunk Girls” was a song that he had, but I don’t know if he played drums on it when we did it live. Maybe that was still already recorded, but it was definitely me and Tyler Pope, the bassist, and Al Doyle, the guitarist, in a studio room playing. I was just like... I had just moved back from Berlin, and I was like, “What?” It was the first thing maybe I ever did with LCD in the context of the band. And I was just kind of like, “OK, let me do something interesting here.” And playing this kind of out of time synth thing that got edited in there somehow. James took that and cut it up. And I have some songwriting credits on the new record as well. But they’ve always been in interesting ways. They haven’t been because I’m in the studio working so much. Mostly I’ll get a call from James and he’s like, “Hey, do you want to come by and do a little synth on this thing?” Aaron Gonsher And what has the touring been like? Because you’ve probably been on tour with them now for years and years, since 2010. Gavin Rayna Russom So I did one tour with LCD in 2010 and ‘11, that was about a year and a half long. And then I did another tour for American Dream that started in 2016, January of 2016, and ended in June of 2018. Two and a half years on the road, which is really unusual, especially nowadays. But I think there was so much excitement that the band had gotten back together that we toured for one whole year with no record out, and then a record came out and then we toured for a year and a half. That was wild and pretty all-consuming. It was pretty fast-moving and I think LCD songs become something very different when they become live songs. LCD records are mostly, I think, the outcome of James working in the studio and crafting those things layer by layer. But when we play them live, they become something really different. Like I said, even from the very beginning, that’s sort of been a part of where I’ve been brought in is, “I did this thing in the studio, and I did this totally nuts thing where I plugged this one synth into another and I don’t know how to recreate it live and if I did, how could we do it every night?” So a lot of my work on the design end has been to figure out how to design synthesis systems for LCD to take on the road that measure up to the degree of timbral complexity that James gets into in the studio. Aaron Gonsher In brief, what are some of those comprised of? Gavin Rayna Russom Well, I think the main thing that happened... In 2010, kind of again, one of the first things that James used is the EMS Synthi in the studio all the time, like constantly, constantly. And it’s super unstable. Even back in 2002, one of the first jobs I got hired for was, he was like, “Can you stabilize this thing? It’s so all over the place.” So I rebuilt the power supply and stuff like that. But then to go on the road, he was like, “Well, how are we going to do this? All the songs are centered around this one synth and we can’t take it on the road. It’s too unpredictable.” So I was just doing a lot of researching and sourcing and that was kind of the beginning of Eurorack stuff. So I found, there’s Analogue Systems, I think. There’s so many different synthesizer companies that are “analogue something with an S.” So I think it’s Analogue Systems, not Analogue Solutions or any of the other ones. But I think it’s Analogue Systems. There was a British company that did all of these Eurorack EMS Synthi modules. So that was kind of the beginning of that, of, “Oh, OK.” Then it would be like, “Oh, but there’s this one thing that they don’t make. Let me find that from another company.” So as Eurorack kind of grew and became this big thing, it went from this challenge of seeking out the few, one weird person that makes these modules to wading through this just massive field of synthesizer modules, most of which don’t do things that James is really interested in, and finding, “OK, what are the things that people have created to be able to reproduce these things?” It’s like the Intellijel envelope whatever, envelope generator. It’s like that is very close to the Arp 2600 one, because it uses the sliders and it has three speed settings so you can get the ultra-fast Arp envelope. So that was a thing of sourcing out, “OK, there’s 1,000 different envelope generators. What’s the one that’s going to sound like an Arp 2600, because there’s those two things.” There’s a lot of that. Then it’s kind of interesting because having designed these things, not from scratch, but essentially from curating from what’s in the world and building systems, then I have a really deep relationship to playing them every night because I’ve sort of built the whole thing and understand how the system works and it was several years in LCD before I could hire a tech to help me, so I just also had all of this technical information in my head and was, at the same time, doing this tech thing and this performance thing. So re-patching a synth during a break in the song while I’m playing another part of a song. It’s a really interesting, weird headspace. It’s the closest thing to being a waitress. I’m just constantly moving and having to manage all these different things and finding all these, like, “Oh, there’s a tiny space here. There’s this one song where I play on this microKORG over here, but there’s a break in that one song and during that part I can go over there and then re-patch the module so that when the next song comes, that thing’s set up”. So this very sustained kind of constant attention to, “Oh, I can do this and this.” And then do that every night. Aaron Gonsher There’s so much that’s been written about LCD Soundsystem as sort of a band, a creative unit. Are there things that you feel you’ve seen from the inside or that you’ve experienced as a part of this creative unit, that maybe haven’t gotten the attention that you might think they deserve, or that you think are a really compelling aspect of this community of people that has been overlooked for one reason or another? Gavin Rayna Russom Well, I do think one thing. I think genuinely people will say that LCD is a great live band. But I don’t think much of press attention, because it’s just not geared this way, it goes beneath the surface with that. For example, say we were touring from 2016, 2017, 2018. Mostly big club shows, some smaller arena shows, and a lot of festivals. And if you look at the lineups of those festivals, if you look at who was going to play that club the next day, if you look at the bandwidth that LCD was in of successful bands, every single other one of those bands would be running their live show off a laptop with most of it just recording backing tracks. The live show of essentially any other band operating at that level would mostly be their CD turned up really loud, with maybe some live guitar over it, live vocals, but also the vocals recorded. It’s just how people do things. LCD is zero, zero, zero, zero track. There’s no track. There’s no laptop. The closest it gets is there’s an MPC with a couple of drum beats because it’s just not possible to carry the 15 different vintage drum machines that were used in the studio. That is a pretty remarkable thing that... There’s zero track… Aaron Gonsher Nine people in the band touring? Gavin Rayna Russom Well, on stage it’s always six and then there’s two swings. Aaron Gonsher OK. Gavin Rayna Russom And then there’s obviously a huge tech crew. We’re sometimes 50 deep on tour. Three buses, three trucks. It’s a huge production. And I think it’s also to James’s and the band’s credit that it doesn’t feel like that. Whenever I tell people that, they’re surprised. Like they kind of still think it’s the six of us in a van, just pulling out the synth. But it’s a huge production. It’s like working with management and production designers that then will go work with Beyoncé or with Gaga or whatever. It’s with people who work on a very high level in the music industry, but it still feels like it’s just some people playing some songs really loud. But that thing of it having... There’s a piano on stage. There’s a CP-70, but it’s a real piano. I have five different analog synths that I’m playing. Almost everybody else has multiple analog synths. There’s two other modular systems. It’s all very crafted on a really deep level so that what you get when you go to an LCD Soundsystem show is really, genuinely something that is unique to that night, even though coming from a place in my own work where I’ll never play the song the same way twice, we are playing the same songs, and they go through the same parts, and the words are the same and all the parts are the same, but it is really different every night because it’s all alive. It’s not to disparage people who do it in different ways, but it is just the sort of standard practice that most bands that operate on a certain level of touring and success will run most of it from Ableton, behind the scenes. That’s a really special thing that I haven’t seen that many people talk about. Aaron Gonsher Whether it’s LCD Soundsystem or the Crystal Ark or your work with Delia Gonzalez or with Peter Gordon and all of these other collaborations that you’ve done over the years, how do you get yourself in a space where you feel like you can sort of dissolve your own biases in favor of the group’s better interests? Gavin Rayna Russom I’m happy you see me that way. Aaron Gonsher I’m not saying that it’s you specific, but I think with collaboration in general, people come in with different goals and preconceived notions. I’m curious just how you navigate that as a working musician for the last 20 years who has made a lot of solo work, but also done a lot of collaborations? Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah. I mean, it was interesting because when I was reviewing those questions you sent me I think in the one about collaboration you listed many more than the average person would list. I was like, “Wow, that is a lot of people.” I’ve also collaborated with each of those people in really different ways. You know, I don’t know. It’s such an interesting thing about art and ego and interpersonal relations. It’s funny that we didn’t talk about it, because it’s such a big part of my musical development, but after I graduated from this arts high school and I moved back to Providence, I had this experience of starting this kind of improvisational, psychedelic noise band with my cousin and some people that I had been in more of a punk band with many years earlier. It was my first experiences of improvising. It was really my first experiences of stepping outside of my preconceived ideas about music. Instead of being like, “I want to make acid house,” to being like, “What happens if I hold the bass guitar in front of the amp for a while?” It really was this really fertile time to explore sound in a group setting, and it was really amazing for a while. It was a really amazing thing where we just sort of all get together, we didn’t really know what we were doing. It was drums, bass guitar but then we had like an M1 keyboard. At that time, it was weird. It knocked it way out of the box of what it was. And then it turned into a classic band situation. We went in the studio and sat there and mixed a record. The drummer was like, “The drums aren’t loud enough.” The guitar player was like, “I can’t hear my part.” It just turned into... you know? You’ve seen a lot of rock documentaries and stuff. And I mean I also was in that as well. My particular flavor was like, “I want this to be more experimental.” But it became this push-pull of egos. That made a big impression on me. That, for me, was a really painful experience to have a thing go from this really magical thing where I felt like I could fluidly operate within a group, maintain my own identity but also feel it to be a kind of negotiated exchange. It just seemed like this powerful energetic thing, to have that move to this, “Well, I don’t like that part.” I think that was such an intense experience for me. First of all, it really drove me to making solo work for a long time. But then it also meant that I tended to engage in collaborations in a really thoughtful way, and to try to find different ways of having interpersonal experiences with music. Like I said, those things have been super different. Like you mentioned the collaboration with Traxx... I mean I’ve done some different stuff with Traxx, but the psych-y stuff that we did. He came to my studio and he was like, “I have this idea. I want to make these two covers of these psych-y tracks.” It took me a while to figure out what he was talking about, but finally I got it. I was like, “OK. That’s what we’re going to do. You want me to recreate the sounds that are on these psych records, and we’re going to play together and we’re going to recreate these tracks. That’s cool. I get that. We can totally do that.” And Peter Gordon, he was like, “I would like you to come play this 1973 Arthur Russell piece that’s never been performed live, except for the three times that they did it in the ’70s.” Or James saying, “I want you to do this.” The Crystal Ark was a case of me saying to this artist that I’d met, Viva Ruiz, it’s like, “Hey, I made this music. I want somebody to do vocals on it and I want those vocals to be in Spanish. I want you to write something that’s meaningful to you.” I mean, so some of it is also having some clear ideas about what is the nature of the collaboration? I mean my collaboration with Delia I think was the opposite. It was a total melding and mushing of things. It was interesting because we don’t actually have that much in common, so when we did that coming together thing, it created this really interesting thing I think. I don’t know, it’s definitely a complex thing. Collaboration is really complex. I think like other things, it’s been helpful for me to not take things for granted about it and not just be like, “Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody knows this is how you collaborate.” But to really think about it and take it apart a bit and be like, “OK, well if we’re collaborating, what does that really mean? What is the nature of that collaboration? What am I bringing? What are you bringing? How is that going to happen? Are we going to spend some time making music together? Or am I going to send you some tracks, and have you do something and then send them back?”
I think it becomes that thing too of trying to pull away the layers of assumptions about how it has to go, and get a little bit more active about, “OK, we’re doing something together.” Just like if you’re in a relationship with somebody. The only real rules are the rules that you come up with. Yes, you can go into it and be like, “No, I know what it means. This is what it means to be in a relationship,” but those are assumptions, whereas if you actually have those conversations, it pulls those layers apart a little bit. Aaron Gonsher There was a particular quote. You released The Xecond Xoming of Black Meteoric Star in 2015, ’16? Gavin Rayna Russom I think it was ’16 by the time it came out. That was also a long time between when it was finished and when it came out. Aaron Gonsher And it was Xecond Xoming with second coming spelled with two Xs instead of an S and a C. There was a quote. You had previously described it as, “Territories of self-discovery,” that accompanied the making of The Xecond Xoming, which was a really resonant quote for me at the time when it came out. And then it felt like it became even more resonant at that point in 2017 where you decided to publicly identify as a trans woman for the first time. We’ve spoken a lot here about the history of electronic music and that connection to identity. I was just hoping that you could speak a little bit about how that resonates with your own journey as a musician, in this context? Gavin Rayna Russom Yeah. Well, it’s really cool, I appreciate you bringing up that quote. It was interesting. There was this interesting parallel that the first Black Meteoric Star sort of suite of 12"s that came out on DFA in 2009, which we all finished I think three years earlier; no, four of them were done in 2006, the other ones were done in 2009. It sort of marked the end of the period of time where I was collaborating with Delia and working on this synthesizer music, and sort of marked a personal emergence from what had been a collaborative time. The Xecond Xoming is sort of a similar thing with the Crystal Ark. That also was like emerging from this time where I was very invested in a collaboration, and then having this kind of foisting up of a deeper more personal vision kind of push out of that. That was definitely a big part of the experience of working on The Xecond Xoming stuff. And yeah, I mean Black Meteoric Star, really it was my transition lab too. I don’t know what the gender of Black Meteoric Star is, but as I explored what was significant for me musically, and what was significant for me about the night club experience and started to build the Black Meteoric Star character and how that character would dress, the blurring of gender boundaries was one of the most significant things. The Black Meteoric Star character always had this very long wig, so I got to wear a wig. It’s a common experience among trans folks that a lot of trans folks really love Halloween because you get to blur that boundary. For me, if I could put a headscarf on my head, I was like, “He, he, he.” I get to be the person that I actually am in the world for a minute. And Black Meteoric Star was definitely like that. It was one of the many things that was happening. It was like, “I get to put on a wig and be out in the world. Be in this room full of people because I’m in a club.” I’d usually wear lipstick. Especially in the early days of Black Meteoric Star, really work with feminine modes of performance through dress. I mean, there’s lots of performative things. The one that was most significant to me was I was in São Paulo and there’s one of the important figures from Afro-Brazilian religion, this Pomba Gira. I don’t know, all that stuff is very complex. It’s something I’ve studied on a really, really, really deep level, and it’s a very significant part of how I do my work, researching things like that and researching along multiple lines. Not just through a Eurocentric mode of research, but anyway, that’s a whole other thing. So I wrote a special Black Meteoric Star track called “Pomba Gira” and changed my outfit and was dressed in this “Pomba Gira” outfit. It was always this sort of lab for experimenting with the things about nightlife that had been significant to me, but also, you know there is that thing about that type of excavation on a creative level. It’s like, “OK, I’m into this, but what’s really under that? Where can I go with this?” That, for me, is inextricably connected with personal authenticity. And as I do that work and try to push my creative work towards where I think it wants to go, I’m inevitably confronting things about myself that are in the way of authentically being the person who can create that work. I mean it’s again, going back to... My composition professor would always say, “The creative process is one of weeding the bullshit out of your soul.” That really has been... Whether it’s because he said that and I adopted that philosophy, or because it’s just how it is for me, that has definitely been a big part of my experience. If I want to continue to evolve creatively and grow and work towards whatever is the more deep aspects of my concerns, I inevitably have to confront things about myself which are problematic, or which are difficult, or which are standing in the way of me actually being the person that I was sort of born and destined to be. Trans experience is broad and very differentiated. I’m a trans-feminine person who was aware of that for as long as I can remember. I grew up in a neighborhood where there was lots of people out on the street and talking. I remember really vividly walking down the street and having two women who were sitting on a porch being like, “Oh my god, look how she’s throwing her hips out. She’s like a grown-up.” And then realizing that I was assigned male at birth. And being like, “Oh my god, that’s a little boy,” and loving that. I was like six years old and being like, “Oh my god, I do kind of throw my hips out.” Those experiences stuck with me, but there was always some way in which... Well there’s two things. There was some way in which I was not able for myself to relax into the truth. There was also the thing that I didn’t understand; it’s so strange, but that... I don’t know if it’s because to some degree I’m a public figure, especially because of my work with LCD Soundsystem, or if it’s because of the way that our culture works, but I actually didn’t become real until I stated it publicly, for whatever reason, despite the fact that I knew this. If we had bumped into each other in a bar in 1996, I would have told you, “I’m a girl.” But there was what I think was a simultaneous inner inability to deny the truth, coupled with an outer necessity to share that truth. Which is weird, because it kind of goes against a lot of things that I believe about what’s it like to be a person in society, that you don’t need to share everything. There can be an opacity. The person that you are publicly doesn’t have to be the person that you are privately and at depth. I do know that, for me, it was necessary because at the time I was on tour with a band that was very popular. I was about to play on Saturday Night Live. When I started really getting, “This is what’s going to happen on my transition,” I was like a month from playing on Saturday Night Live. Talk about head fuck. It was an amazing blessing that somebody in my life who worked in the field of PR kind of pulled me aside and was like, “If you don’t control this story, somebody else will because you are in the public eye at this moment for this reason.” There was this necessity to say, “I’m going to need to tell my story publicly because otherwise somebody else is going to tell it.” And as a person whose story has been told incorrectly so many times, that was a major moment of being able to say, “No, actually, it’s not your idea of what this is. This is what this is.” And that did have a powerful inner corollary and that experience of then going on tour for another 18 months and every single night being in front of a bunch of people and being like, “How am I going to work this out? What am I going to wear?” Even though it at the time seemed like, “This is so hard.” I slept a lot. I played shows and slept basically, but in retrospect, in a way, it almost kind of made it easier because it’s like I couldn’t let my fears control me. It was my job, and I had to turn up for my job. I guess I could have been like, “Sorry guys, I’m not going to do this.” In the beginning I was like, “Maybe I’ll just put off transitioning until I’m done with this tour.” I remember... I’ve been in therapy for like 20 years probably, and my therapist being like, “I don’t think that’s an option.” And being like, “Yeah, it’s true.” It wasn’t an option. It really had to happen the way it happened. Definitely that kind of complex interplay between the public and the private was, and continues to be, something that is worth unpacking and thinking about. It’s also changed the way I think about a lot of things too. I mean, visibility is obviously a very complex issue for trans folks. Traditionally, I think we’ve been either invisible or hyper-visible but have not had the ability to just be people in the world being ourselves, which is, I think, the experience of other folks who have marginalized experience as well. That is something that I do feel and has been interesting to negotiate. I do feel like what this whole bunch of things we’ve talked about today, this whole complex of different experiences and different influences and being around different people and hearing different things, that as well as many other things has given me different tools. Initially creativity was my only tool. I was the kid who grabbed onto creativity for dear life because it was the only thing that made sense to me. At a certain point I found I had to really find other tools too. Creativity was amazing, but it wasn’t capable of doing everything that I was demanding from it. It still is an incredibly important part of that process because of its ability to illuminate things about me that tend to remain hidden if I don’t keep making stuff. I mean, I know I just talked for a super long time, but the last thing I’ll just say about that too is that a big part of that is the experience of being in my body, of not just experiencing the world intellectually, but actually being inside my body. Ultimately, it was my body that telegraphed to me the truth about gender and things beyond gender and all of that stuff. So much of that experience of being in my body happened on dancefloors, and in movement and with music. Whether it be like being on tour as a dancer with Black Leotard Front, or going to Berghain. you know, or like whatever, across the board one of the baseline critical experiences was the experience of like, experiencing music physically. Moving and feeling, like if I’m in my authentic experience of this music, what does that look and feel like? Which I think is something different than the experience of somebody who occupies the socially constructed identity five days a week, and then like cuts loose on the weekend. Not to sound judgmental or critical of that, but I think it’s more that I want to make a distinction between something that I think is so significant about the potentials of not just dance music and club culture, but the entire kind of social hold that it forms a part of. The commodification of that in terms of the way in which that’s sort of sold as a dream in our contemporary culture where that stuff has now become like hyper commoditized, like in festivals and stuff. You can pay a bunch of money and come to this place, and then you get to be free in this place. I’m talking about something that’s very different than that, you know, but that has similar, it’s similar to the thing that I was talking about, about trying to find terms to describe alternative culture, but within the consciousness that those terms have all been so co-opted. While I think 125 BPM, 4/4 kicks, you know, strange synthesizer sounds, compelling vocal samples, like all of those things have at times driven me to a point of very deep embodied self-awareness. Like they are not actually really the point. The point is something else that was constructed in a much more complex, deep way that connects to, like you were saying about Traxx, that connects to lineage, connects to ancestry, connects to where things come from. That isn’t art objects, that’s like removed from a social whole and then made into a product that you go and consume for a little while and then go back to what you were doing. Because of that, those experiences were for me genuinely transformative. Like, they didn’t have the flavor. I didn’t just get like the transformed t-shirt, but I was genuinely transformed. Hopefully will continue to be. Aaron Gonsher I think that’s a really beautiful point to end on. Thank you very much. [applause] Gavin Rayna Russom Thank you.
